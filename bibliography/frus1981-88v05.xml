    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the
            foreign policy decisions of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. The volume
            documents the development and implementation of the Reagan administration’s policies
            toward the Soviet Union from March 1985 to October 1986. The volume focuses on how the
            administration approached the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and his reform
            efforts; arms control negotiations at the Nuclear and Space Talks, which opened in
            Geneva in March 1985; the Geneva Summit of November 1985 and the Reykjavik Summit of
            October 1986, and various meetings among President Reagan, Secretary of State George
            Shultz, and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, his replacement Eduard Shevardnadze,
            and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The documentation in this volume provides a
            more nuanced understanding of the relationship that developed between Reagan and
            Gorbachev during this period, through their summits and correspondence. The volume also
            shows how the Reagan administration continued to adhere to the four-part framework it
            established in January 1983 in dealing with the Soviet Union, regardless of the new
            leadership of Gorbachev. Administration officials worked diligently to move the
            U.S.-Soviet relationship forward; the sustained level of understanding and cooperation
            they developed with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze played a major role in this
            endeavor.</tei:p>
