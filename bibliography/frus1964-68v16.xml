    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Major topics covered in this volume include: 1) U.S. efforts to maintain the
                cohesion of the NATO alliance by avoiding outbreaks of violence on Cyprus that would
                provoke clashes between Greece and Turkey; 2) attempts of U.S. policymakers to
                devise a compromise solution for Cyprus that would meet the requirements of its
                major regional partners; 3) a growing U.S. involvement in Greece's internal politics
                as a result of a major constitutional crisis between political forces led by George
                and Andreas Papandreou on one side and a conservative coalition under the leadership
                of King Constantine II on the other; and 4) the U.S reaction to the Greek military
                coup of April 1967 and imposition of a dictatorship in Greece. Coverage of bilateral
                U.S.-Turkish relations focuses on the Cyprus issue.</tei:p>
