        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Major topics covered in this volume include:
            1) U.S. efforts to maintain the cohesion of the NATO alliance by avoiding outbreaks of
            violence on Cyprus that would provoke clashes between Greece and Turkey; 2) attempts of
            U.S. policymakers to devise a compromise solution for Cyprus that would meet the
            requirements of its major regional partners; 3) a growing U.S. involvement in Greece's
            internal politics as a result of a major constitutional crisis between political forces
            led by George and Andreas Papandreou on one side and a conservative coalition under the
            leadership of King Constantine II on the other; and 4) the U.S reaction to the Greek
            military coup of April 1967 and imposition of a dictatorship in Greece. Coverage of
            bilateral U.S.-Turkish relations focuses on the Cyprus issue.</tei:p>
