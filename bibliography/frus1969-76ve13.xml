    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume supplements the recently released
            print volume <tei:ref target="frus1969-76v17">XVII, China, 1969–1972</tei:ref>, by
            publishing 175 documents, most of which are cited in the footnotes of print volume XVII,
            that relate to the high-level contacts between the People’s Republic of China and the
            United States. Typically, the print volume presents the shorter (and sometimes more
            subjective) summary memorandum of a conversation or important message that National
            Security Advisor Henry A. Kissinger and the National Security Council staff prepared for
            the President, while the supplement contains the verbatim memorandum of conversation or
            the full text of messages exchanged. In addition, Vol. E–13 contains documentation on
            the Nixon administration’s historic opening to China, including accounts of meetings at
            the foreign minister level during President Nixon’s visit to Beijing in 1972,
            backchannel messages, and memoranda from other agencies, such as the Department of
            Defense. This extra coverage of the Nixon administration’s opening to China is the
            result of a decision to give this historic and important U.S. foreign policy shift
            maximum coverage in the Foreign Relations series.</tei:p>
