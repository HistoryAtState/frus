    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is organized chronologically. As
            such it conveys the shift in control over U.S. China policy from the White House to the
            Department of State as a result of the Watergate crisis, the appointment of Henry
            Kissinger as Secretary of State, the resignation of Richard Nixon as President, and
            Gerald Ford’s request that Kissinger relinquish his position as Advisor to the President
            for National Security Affairs. The chapters integrate documents about U.S. relations
            with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan, reflecting the fact that the
            former government received much more attention from high-level American policymakers
            than did the latter. The central theme of the volume is the effort to strengthen and
            formalize the PRC–US relationship, which had been established during 1971 and 1972 after
            decades of bitter estrangement, and the concurrent disestablishment of formal diplomatic
            relations with Taiwan, a task that remained unfinished at the end of the Ford
            Administration. The primary means used to improve relations during these years were long
            conversations between U.S. and PRC leaders, which were supposed to initiate—but
            generally substituted for—a more developed and institutionalized relationship.</tei:p>
