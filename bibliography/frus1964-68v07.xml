        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editor of the volume sought to present
            documentation that explained and illuminated the major foreign policy decisions and
            problems on Vietnam faced by the President and his key foreign policy advisers during
            the last 4 and 1/2 months of his administration. The documents highlight the Johnson
            administration's slow and agonizing internal deliberations on how to achieve formal
            four-party peace negotiations on Vietnam in Paris. A good part of this search for peace
            was carried out during the 1968 Presidential election amid suspicions by the Democratic
            and Republican candidates, and President Lyndon Johnson himself, that the respective
            Presidential candidates were using the peace process to influence the election. In
            addition, both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the Republic of
            Vietnam (South Vietnam) had their own demands for the procedures and modalities of the
            formal peace process, all of which had to be reconciled. This volume is the account of
            how the Johnson administration achieved the opening of formal four-party peace talks in
            Paris. </tei:p>
