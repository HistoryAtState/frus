    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the
            foreign policy decision-making of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. It
            highlights U.S. policy toward each of the countries in Eastern Europe – with the
            exception of Poland, which is covered in two separate volumes. The documentation focuses
            on the Reagan administration’s efforts to manage its policy of differentiation, laid out
            in the September 1982 National Security Decision Directive 54, which declared that “the
            primary long-term U.S. goal in Eastern Europe is to loosen the Soviet hold on the region
            and thereby facilitate its eventual reintegration into the European community of
            nations.” The administration sought to do this by continuing “to differentiate in its
            policies toward the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe, and
            among the countries of Eastern Europe, so as to encourage diversity through political
            and economic policies tailored to individual countries.” The documentation shows that
            Eastern European officials struggled to understand the U.S. policy of differentiation,
            and that many sought to strengthen their country’s relationship with the United States
            to obtain better trade agreements, technology, and equipment, even as they endeavored to
            maintain their ties to the Soviet Union.</tei:p>
