    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editors have assembled and present in
            this volume the complete official record of President Kennedy's meetings with Soviet
            Chairman Nikita Khrushchev at the Vienna Summit Conference, June 3-4, 1961, together
            with the related U.S. delegation records of the conference, the essential pre-conference
            preparatory correspondence and internal discussions, and the post mortems regarding the
            conference. A guide to the broader universe of State Department documentation at the
            National Archives and Presidential records at the John F. Kennedy Library is also
            included.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Also presented in this volume are the records
            of the major high-level U.S. meetings, policy discussions, working papers, and the
            principal comprehensive reports from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow regarding ongoing
            U.S.-Soviet conflicts. These major policy discussions and papers take up or touch upon a
            broad range of issues comprising U.S.-Soviet relations. This comprehensive accounting is
            more fully presented in more than 100 chronologically located editorial notes that
            describe major diplomatic episodes in U.S.-Soviet relations in Europe, the Middle East,
            Latin America, and Asia and the ongoing arms control exchanges between the two nations
            that are fully documented in other volumes of the Foreign Relations series for the
            Kennedy presidency. This is an unprecedented procedure for the Foreign Relations series.
            It reflects the editors' conviction that users of the series require in one volume a
            synthesis of what is spread over nine volumes documenting the 1961–1963 period.</tei:p>
