        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations. The
            focus of this volume is on the relationship between the United States and Western Europe
            during the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford administrations from 1973 until 1976. It begins
            by examining the relationship from a regional perspective, focusing on the Year of
            Europe initiative, U.S. relations with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and
            with the European Communities, and issues such as the rise of Eurocommunism. The volume
            then explores U.S. bilateral relations with nine countries: Canada, Portugal, Iceland
            and Norway (paired in a single Nordic countries chapter), Spain, the United Kingdom, the
            Federal Republic of Germany, France, and Italy, which will be added when it is cleared
            for publication.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Although the volume is meant to stand on its
            own, for the most comprehensive picture of U.S. relations with Western Europe during the
            years 1973 to 1976, readers should read this volume in conjunction with several other
            Nixon-Ford subseries volumes covering the same period, including Greece; Cyprus; Turkey
            (volume XXX); Foreign Economic Policy (volume XXXI); Energy Crisis, 1969–1974 (volume
            XXXVI); Energy Crisis, 1974–1980 (volume XXXVII); and European Security, 1969–1976
            (volume XXXIX).</tei:p>
