    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The documentation printed in this volume
            focuses on the formulation of U.S. policy toward North Asia, particularly the most
            significant aspects of U.S. political, economic, and military relationships with the
            Governments of Japan, Korea, and the Republic of China on Taiwan. Also included is
            documentation on U.S. policies toward the People's Republic of China and Mongolia, with
            which the United States had no official diplomatic relations. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">President Kennedy in conjunction with key
            advisers made the major foreign policy decisions during his presidency, and the editors
            tried to document his role as much possible. The role of White House and National
            Security Council Staff members in providing information and advice to the President grew
            during this period. The editors accordingly selected memoranda that presented to the
            President the views and recommendations of his White House advisers. Formal approved
            policy papers were rare in the Kennedy administration, and internal discussions between
            the President and his advisers were not always recorded. The editors sought to document
            Presidential decisions by drawing upon the best material available. The Department of
            State continued to play a leading role in formulating foreign policy and providing
            advice on foreign policy matters to the President, and it played the principal role in
            exchanges of view and negotiations on policy matters with foreign governments. The
            volume includes documentation on a range of lesser policy decisions that did not reach
            the President or were resolved in the Department of State or other foreign affairs
            agencies. </tei:p>
