        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume presents the record of U.S.
            policy with respect to Eastern Europe as a region, the Soviet Union, and Cyprus during
            the final three years of the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During the years 1958–1960, the Department of
            State worked closely with the White House in the formulation of U.S. policy toward
            Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and Cyprus. Secretaries of State John Foster Dulles
            and Christian A. Herter advised President Eisenhower in detail and had major roles in
            the deliberations of the National Security Council. The White House and National
            Security Council also directed the preparation of reports based on interagency
            information on these areas. The Department of State prepared and coordinated exchanges
            of views and discussions of policy toward Cyprus with the British Government, and
            Department officers participated in the meetings between President Eisenhower and
            Chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev in September 1959.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Policy formulation is documented in memoranda
            of discussion at National Security Council meetings, institutional NSC documents, White
            House records, Department of State files, memoranda of conversation and other records of
            meetings between the President and his principal foreign policy advisers, policy
            recommendations by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and internal U.S. Government policy
            recommendations and decision papers.</tei:p>
