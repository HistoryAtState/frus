        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the Foreign Relations series that documents the most important issues in the foreign
            policy of the administrations of Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford. This specific
            volume documents U.S. regional and bilateral relations with Western Europe from January
            20, 1969 to January 20, 1973. The documentation printed in this volume highlights U.S.
            policy regarding European economic and political integration, U.S. participation in the
            North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as U.S. bilateral relations with
            Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. The first
            chapter focuses on U.S. policy toward Western Europe and Canada as a whole, with a focus
            on two key issues that faced the Nixon administration: 1) how to maintain the cohesion
            of the Atlantic Alliance at a time of reduced tensions with the Soviet Union, and 2) how
            to respond to the emergence of serious economic tensions among the advanced
            industrialized nations. The country chapters in this volume emphasize the key issues
            that affected each bilateral relationship.</tei:p>
