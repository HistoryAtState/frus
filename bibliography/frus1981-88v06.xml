        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the
            foreign policy decision making of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. The
            second release of four Soviet bilateral volumes, it commences immediately following the
            dramatic encounter at Reykjavik, on October 10–11, 1986, where U.S. and Soviet leaders
            propelled the negotiation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and the
            Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), and focuses on subsequent interactions between
            and among President Ronald Reagan, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, Secretary
            of State George Shultz, and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Included are
            internal deliberations and memoranda of conversation from the December 1987 Washington
            Summit, where Reagan and Gorbachev signed the landmark INF Treaty, and the May 1988
            Moscow Summit, where Reagan stood with Gorbachev in Red Square and stated his phrase
            from 5 years earlier—“evil empire”—applied to “another time, another era.”</tei:p>
