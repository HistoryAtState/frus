    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the
            foreign policy decision making of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. This
            volume focuses on U.S. foreign economic policies toward and relations with the
            developing world from 1981 until 1988. It covers the formulation of U.S. foreign
            economic assistance and development policies, policies toward developing countries in
            the United Nations and at international meetings, the U.S. response to international
            debt problems, international commodity policy, and policies toward international
            financial institutions. As this volume takes a global and thematic approach, foreign
            economic policy issues related to a specific country or region are generally not
            documented in it, but instead are covered in regional and country-specific volumes
            within the subseries.</tei:p>
