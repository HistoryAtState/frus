    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume focuses on the issues that
            primarily engaged high-level U.S. policymakers. Major topics include: 1) U.S.
            anticipation of the first Chinese nuclear explosion and the U.S. reaction when it took
            place in October 1964; 2) the attempts of U.S. policymakers to deal with the issue of
            Chinese representation in the United Nations; 3) U.S. relations with the Chinese
            Nationalists on Taiwan, especially the question of possible Nationalist operations
            against the mainland; 4) the ambassadorial meetings at Warsaw; 5) proposals to
            liberalize U.S. restrictions on travel to and trade with the China mainland; 6) the U.S.
            response to French recognition of the People's Republic of China; and 7) U.S. policy
            concerning Tibet.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The absence of U.S. diplomatic representation
            in the People's Republic of China increased the importance of intelligence on China. The
            editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level
            policymakers, especially those that were sent to President Johnson, and made a
            particular effort to include a sampling of reports and analyses on the Cultural
            Revolution. Selected intelligence estimates and analyses on internal developments in
            Taiwan were also included.</tei:p>
