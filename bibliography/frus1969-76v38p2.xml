    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            issues in the foreign policy of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford. The
            volume has been divided into two parts: Part One, published in 2012, documents the
            intellectual foundations of the foreign policy of the second Nixon and Ford
            administrations and should be read in conjunction with this release; Part Two, this
            specific volume, covers the organization and management of the foreign policy process as
            well as the development of U.S. information policy, public diplomacy, and cultural
            affairs during the 1973–1976 period. The volume documents not only the ways in which the
            end of the Vietnam War, the scandal over Watergate, the emergence of greater
            congressional assertiveness in foreign affairs, and the August 1974 resignation of
            President Nixon all affected the organization of U.S. foreign policymaking institutions,
            but also the impact of broader changes within U.S. society, most notably the changing
            roles of women and minorities, and the proliferation of transnational, global issues as
            agents of organizational change. On the volume’s coverage of public diplomacy, the
            Stanton Panel Report of 1975 figures prominently, as it examined the range of activity
            in this function—including Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the Voice of America, USIA,
            and the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs—and the issues of
            governance in such a complex multi-agency endeavor. The structure and activity of the
            Intelligence Community formed another major organizational focus for policymakers in
            this period, and is also covered in this volume. Most notably, the volume documents the
            Ford administration’s response to the controversial December 1974 “Family Jewels”
            revelations about Intelligence Community activities and the series of congressional
            investigations they prompted, as well as the institutional reforms which the
            administration implemented in 1976. </tei:p>
