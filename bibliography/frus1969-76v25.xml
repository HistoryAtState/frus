        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents U.S. policymaking
            toward the Arab-Israeli conflict between January and December 1973, i.e., during the
            months before, during, and immediately after the Arab-Israeli war of October 1973.
            Documentation in the volume includes memoranda; records of discussions both within the
            U.S. policy-making community, as well as with foreign officials; cables to and from U.S.
            diplomatic posts; and papers that set forth policy issues and options, and which show
            decisions or actions taken.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume covers an important period in the
            history of the U.S. engagement with the Arab-Israeli dispute. The October 1973 War
            represented not only a renewed clash of Arab and Israeli forces, it ignited an energy
            crisis brought on by an Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) oil
            embargo against the United States, and led to the threat of a direct superpower
            confrontation. The war also prompted the United States to undertake an unprecedented
            role in the pursuit of a negotiated settlement to the dispute.</tei:p>
