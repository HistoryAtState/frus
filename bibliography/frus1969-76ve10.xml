        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents the formulation of U.S.
            policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean between 1969 and 1972. Upon taking office
            in January 1969, President Nixon indicated that he intended to give a high priority to
            revitalizing relations with the region. On his first full day as President, Nixon asked
            New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Latin America expert, to assess the
            effectiveness of the Alliance for Progress program initiated by the Kennedy
            administration and to make policy recommendations. Rockefeller’s report helped to shape
            Nixon’s October 31, 1969, speech to the Inter-American Press Association, in which the
            President outlined his vision for U.S.-Latin American relations. In that address, Nixon
            called for “a more mature partnership” with the region. He offered to allow more
            multilateral input into the process of allocating development aid, to reduce barriers to
            trade, to give the management of relations with the nations of the Western Hemisphere a
            special place within the U.S. bureaucracy by raising the Assistant Secretary of State
            for Inter-American Affairs to the rank of Under Secretary, and to deal with Latin
            American governments as they were, recognizing that “enormous, sometimes explosive
            forces for change” in the region could result in instability and changes in government. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume includes documentation on U.S.
            relations with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
            Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua,
            Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. Coverage of El Salvador and Honduras is limited
            to a chapter on the U.S. response to the 1969 “Soccer War,” which broke out after
            violence erupted at a World Cup qualifying match between the two Central American
            countries. An additional chapter on Bolivia will be added once it has been fully cleared
            for publication. Documentation on U.S. relations with Chile between 1969 and September
            1973 will be published in a separate volume.</tei:p>
