        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            issues in the foreign policy of President Richard M. Nixon. It includes a complete set
            of the memoranda of conversation between President’s Assistant for National Security
            Affairs Henry A. Kissinger and North Vietnamese Politburo Member and Special Adviser to
            the North Vietnamese Delegation Le Duc Tho during the negotiations that led to the Paris
            Peace Accords on January 27, 1973. It further includes negotiating sessions between
            Kissinger and Tho conducted in the aftermath of the Agreement, in February, May, June,
            and December 1973, in an attempt to achieve a stable cease-fire. Presented
            chronologically, the documents in this volume—memoranda of conversation recording the
            meetings—show, among other things: 1) the evolution of the U.S. and North Vietnamese
            positions in the negotiations, 2) how the parties reached agreement on the Accords, also
            called the agreement or the settlement, and 3) how the Accords failed to lead to a
            stable cease-fire or to a political settlement of the conflict. </tei:p>
