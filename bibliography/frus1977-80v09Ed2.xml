    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This revised edition incorporates critical
            material found since the publication of the first edition in 2014. This added material
            consists largely of personal handwritten notes taken at the September 5–17, 1978, Camp
            David summit by Samuel W. Lewis, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel from 1978 until 1985.
            Department of State historians found these notes while researching volumes for the
            administration of President Ronald Reagan, amidst Department material dating largely
            from the 1980s. Discovered subsequent to the initial publication of <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi>, 1977–1980, volume IX, Arab-Israeli
            Dispute, August 1978–December 1980, these documents add significantly to the record of
            U.S. diplomacy at Camp David. While they do not alter substantively the portrait of U.S.
            diplomacy at the summit already represented in the first edition of the volume, this
            material enhances the documentary record. Department of State historians also located a
            more complete version of a document already published in the first edition. Sometime
            shortly after the summit’s completion on September 17, 1978, U.S. officials produced a
            draft day-by-day summary of the meetings held over its duration. Readers familiar with
            the first edition will note that the version of this summary document published in that
            edition covers most, but not all, of the summit. As a result of these discoveries, the
            decision was taken to issue a revised edition.</tei:p>
