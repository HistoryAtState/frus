        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume addresses the ending of the
            Vietnam war; a story central to the U.S. experience in the 20th century. Similar to
            other Foreign Relations volumes, this collection of documents emphasizes the formation
            of policy over day-to-day diplomacy. Several themes dominated U.S. policy and policy
            objectives in Indochina during this period: the relationship between force and
            diplomacy, the struggle between the President and Congress in the formation and
            implementation of U.S. policy, U.S. credibility in the world, and the limits of American
            power. These themes dictated the selection of documents in this volume. Soon after the
            fall of Saigon in April 1975, American officials in several agencies began looking back
            at U.S. policy toward, and political and military actions in, Vietnam in an effort to
            understand and learn from the American experience in Indochina beginning in the early
            1960s. This volume places those analyses within the broader documentary context. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume concludes with documentation
            covering the May 1975 seizure by Cambodia of the SS <tei:hi rend="italic"
                >Mayaguez</tei:hi> and the successful recovery by U.S. forces of the ship and its
            crew. The documents cover the crisis deliberations in Washington among civilian and
            military officials that led to President Ford’s decision to use military force to
            recover the ship.</tei:p>
