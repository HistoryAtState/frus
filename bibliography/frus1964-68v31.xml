    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume features eleven bilateral and two
            regional compilations, demonstrating the breadth of the U.S. Government's relations with
            the countries of South and Central America. Many of the bilateral compilations document
            the Johnson administration's responses to a series of crises: the 1964 Panama Canal flag
            incident; the 1964 coup d'etat in Brazil; the 1964 Presidential election in Chile; the
            1966 coup in Argentina; the 1967 hunt for Ernesto "Che" Guevara in Bolivia; the 1968
            coups in Peru and Panama. The bilateral compilations also show how the administration
            tried to address more fundamental problems: the Panama Canal treaty negotiations; the
            insurgencies in Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela; the authoritarian regimes in Brazil and
            Argentina; the continuation of covert political support in Bolivia and Chile; economic
            assistance to Brazil, Colombia and Chile; the protection of American business interests
            in Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, and Chile. The Latin America regional compilation
            emphasizes the broader themes of the administration's policy in the hemisphere: the
            Alliance for Progress; the threat of Cuban subversion; the Punta del Este conference.
            This regional compilation also highlights how personalities affected policymaking,
            especially the working relationship between President Johnson and Assistant Secretary of
            State Thomas Mann. The Central America regional compilation examines how the United
            States exercised its influence in the region, from elections in Costa Rica and Guatemala
            to authoritarian regimes in Honduras and Nicaragua. Given subsequent events, including
            the assassination of Ambassador Gordon Mein in August 1968, the compilation also
            emphasizes the U.S. response to the escalation of violence between the insurgents and
            the Government in Guatemala.</tei:p>
