        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks produced
            a series of comprehensive arms control agreements between the United States and the
            Soviet Union that for the first time limited the deployment of ballistic missiles and
            anti-ballistic missile systems. Commonly referred to as “SALT I,” the agreements were
            signed by President Richard Nixon and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union Leonid
            Brezhnev at the Moscow Summit in May 1972. This volume documents the negotiations
            leading up to the agreement, the internal deliberations among U.S. policy makers, and
            reveals the play of political and national security considerations that factored into
            U.S. policy decisions. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume is organized chronologically
            covering the period of analytical preparation before SALT began, the various rounds of
            negotiations with the Soviet Union alternating among the cities of Helsinki, Geneva and
            Vienna, the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs Henry Kissinger's secret
            trip to Moscow in April 1972, discussions between President Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev at
            the Moscow Summit in May 1972, and the Nixon administration's efforts to secure
            congressional approval of the SALT agreement and ratification of the ABM treaty. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sources for this volume include documents
            generated in the White House, the National Security Council, the Department of State,
            the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The editor
            included extracts from memorandums of conversation between Henry Kissinger, and Soviet
            Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, telephone transcripts and meeting memoranda prepared by
            chief SALT negotiator, Gerard Smith, and a significant number of backchannel messages
            among Smith, Kissinger and Alexander Haig, Deputy Assistant for National Security
            Affairs. Additionally, the editor transcribed specifically for this volume more than
            twenty excerpts from conversations recorded among the President and his advisors on the
            secret White House taping system.</tei:p>
