        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations. The
            focus of this volume is on the relationship between the United States and Western Europe
            from 1973 until 1976. It begins by examining the relationship from a regional
            perspective, focusing on the Year of Europe initiative, U.S. relations with its North
            Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and the European Communities, and issues such as the
            rise of Eurocommunism. The volume then explores U.S. bilateral relations with nine
            countries: Canada, Portugal, Iceland and Norway (paired in a single Nordic countries
            chapter), Spain, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and
            Italy.</tei:p>

            the first edition of the volume, which was published in May 2014. The newly added
            chapter focuses on U.S. concerns about Italian political and economic stability. It
            features memoranda of conversation documenting meetings between Presidents Richard Nixon
            and Gerald Ford and Italian political leaders and assessments of Italian political and
            economic developments prepared by U.S. officials in Washington and Rome. </tei:p>
