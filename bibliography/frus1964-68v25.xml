    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Major topics covered in this volume include:
            1) U.S. military assistance to India and Pakistan; 2) U.S. efforts to counter Chinese
            influence in Pakistan and Soviet influence in India; 3) the U.S. reaction to the crises
            in the Rann of Kutch and Kashmir and the hostilities between India and Pakistan in 1965;
            4) the U.S. reaction to the food crisis on the subcontinent; 5) the U.S. response to the
            decision by Pakistan not to renew the agreement with the United States governing
            facilities at Peshawar; and 6) U.S. efforts in Af ghanistan to use limited economic
            assistance to promote economic development and to limit Soviet influence. Lyndon
            Johnson's personal involvement in the making of foreign policy decisions relating to
            South Asia was second only to his involvement in decisions relating to the fighting in
            Southeast Asia. Johnson's involvement is particularly evident during the 1965 crises
            over Kashmir and the Rann of Kutch and in the U.S. response to the threat of famine in
            India in 1965-1967. The editors sought to document the President's role as far as
            possible. </tei:p>
