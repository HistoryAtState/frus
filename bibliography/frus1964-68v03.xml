        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editors developed the following six areas
            of focus for research and the selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1)
            formulation of policy in Washington, with particular emphasis on the decision to commit
            major ground forces to Vietnam and its consequences for policy makers; 2) the advisory
            process, including recommendations from key advisers in Washington, intelligence
            assessments of the situation in Vietnam, and reporting and advice from U.S. officials in
            Saigon; 3) efforts to negotiate a settlement to the Vietnam conflict, other key
            diplomatic contacts, and the issue of bombing pauses; 4) military planning and strategy
            and non-military programs in Vietnam; 5) the relationship between the United States
            Government and the South Vietnamese Government, including the issue of political
            instability in South Vietnam; and 6) the implementation of policy in South Vietnam.
