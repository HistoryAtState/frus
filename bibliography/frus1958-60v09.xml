        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume presents documentation on U.S.
            policy toward Berlin following the four-power Foreign Ministers Meeting, May 11–August
            5, 1959, with particular attention to the abortive summit conference in May 1960; U.S.
            relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria; and U.S. policy toward the
            German Democratic Republic.</tei:p>

        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Policy formulation is documented in memoranda
            of discussion at National Security Council meetings, institutional NSC documents,
            informal foreign policy materials, White House records, memoranda of conversation and
            other records of meetings between the President and his principal foreign policy
            advisers, policy recommendations by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and key National
            Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates.</tei:p>

        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During the years 1959–1960, the Department of
            State participated actively in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Berlin, West
            Germany, and Austria. Secretary of State Christian A. Herter advised President Dwight D.
            Eisenhower and took part in the deliberations of the National Security Council. The
            Department of State prepared and coordinated exchanges of views and negotiations on
            policy matters with the German and Austrian Governments. The volume includes memoranda
            of conversation between Secretary Herter and his counterparts in West Germany and
            Austria and the Mayor of West Berlin, internal U.S. Government policy recommendations
            and decision papers relating to such important topics as the status of Berlin, U.S.
            policy on German reunification, and the maintenance of Austrian security and neutrality.
            Telegrams document important reports and policy recommendations of U.S. representatives
            at the Mission in Berlin and the Embassies in Bonn, Moscow, and Vienna.</tei:p>
