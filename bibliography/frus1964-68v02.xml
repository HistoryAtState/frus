        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editors developed the following six areas
            of focus for research and the selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1)
            formulation of policy in Washington, with particular emphasis on the series of decisions
            that led to the commitment of major ground forces to Vietnam; 2) the advisory process,
            including recommendations from key advisers in Washington, intelligence assessments of
            the situation in Vietnam, and reporting and advice from U.S. officials in Saigon; 3)
            efforts to negotiate a settlement to the Vietnam conflict, and other key diplomatic
            contacts; 4) military planning and strategy; 5) the relationship between the United
            States Government and the South Vietnamese Government, including the issue of political
            instability in South Vietnam; and 6) the implementation of policy in South Vietnam.
