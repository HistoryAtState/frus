    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents the foreign policy of
            the Nixon administration toward sub-Saharan Africa with the exceptions of the Republic
            of South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, and Namibia, which are covered in print
            volume Foreign Relations 1969–1976, Vol. XXVIII, Southern Africa, 1969–1976. In
            addition, chapters on U.S. policy toward North Africa will be included in this
            electronic-only volume when they are declassified. This volume does not attempt to cover
            all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but instead concentrates on those areas where U.S.
            interests and concerns were greatest. The chapter on general U.S. policy toward Africa
            provides the widest scope of coverage. </tei:p>
