        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents U.S. responses to the
            dramatic changes that took place in the global oil production system from 1969 until
            1974. During this period long-established relationships among oil producing nations, oil
            consuming nations, and international oil companies underwent a tumultuous realignment.
            As traditional contractual arrangements between producing nations and international oil
            corporations broke down, political and economic influence shifted from consuming nations
            to producing states. The diplomatic effects of this shift in the global monetary balance
            of power were wide-ranging and include the oil embargo imposed by Arab oil-exporting
            countries during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. This volume documents U.S. efforts to
            negotiate an end to the embargo, relations with oil producing states such as Saudi
            Arabia, U.S. relations with allies in the Atlantic Alliance and elsewhere, the
            administration’s attempt to reformulate the U.S. oil import program in 1969,
            negotiations between international oil companies and oil producing states, efforts to
            create bureaucratic structures to deal with energy issues, and attempts to prepare U.S.
            consumers to adjust to the long-term consequences of a tighter oil market and higher
            priced oil.</tei:p>
