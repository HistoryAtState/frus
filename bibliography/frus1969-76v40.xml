    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume represents a departure in
            coverage on Germany and Berlin in the Foreign Relations series. Previous volumes covered
            bilateral relations between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany in
            breadth, including documentation on economic and military issues, as well as on matters
            of politics and diplomacy. Although this volume covers such issues, especially when
            decision-making was at a high level, more extensive documentation on discussions between
            Washington and Bonn on international economics and national security has been—and will
            be—published in other volumes: Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume III, Foreign
            Economic Policy, 1969–1972; International Monetary Policy, 1969–1972; and Volume XLI,
            Western Europe; NATO, 1969–1972. This volume examines key issues in German-American
            relations in more depth, emphasizing two issues in particular: the response of the Nixon
            administration to Chancellor Willy Brandt and his Eastern policy (Ostpolitik); and the
            secret negotiations leading to signature of the Berlin quadripartite agreement in
            September 1971. Moscow was a key player in the diplomacy behind both Bonn’s Ostpolitik
            and the Berlin agreement. This volume, therefore, also focuses on the Soviet Union, and
            places bilateral relations between the United States and the Federal Republic in the
            context of the competition between the two superpowers. This is, in other words, a “cold
            war” volume—or perhaps, more accurately, a “détente” volume—and thus should be read in
            conjunction with Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume XII, Soviet Union, January
            1969–October 1970; Volume XIII, Soviet Union, October 1970–October 1971; and Volume XIV,
            Soviet Union, October 1971–May 1972.</tei:p>
