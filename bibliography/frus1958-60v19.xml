        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume focuses on the formulation of U.S.
            policy with regard to China and on the most significant aspects of the U.S. relationship
            with the People’s Republic of China and U.S. relations with the Republic of China on
            Taiwan. Policy recommendations to President Eisenhower and his decisions with respect to
            government policies and actions are documented as fully as possible. Discussions and
            actions of the National Security Council and Presidential discussions of policy with
            Cabinet-level officers are included, as are discussions between Secretary of State
            Dulles and his top advisers. During the Taiwan Strait crisis, both Eisenhower and Dulles
            played more active roles in policymaking on China than was usually the case.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Documentation on relations with the Republic
            of China is generally confined to discussions of key issues between high-level
            officials. In general, the emphasis is on political developments, but some material is
            included on U.S. efforts to encourage economic development on Taiwan. Summary records of
            all the Ambassadorial talks at Warsaw are included. The volume includes reportage,
            analyses, and intelligence estimates, especially concerning the China mainland, which
            were seen by high-level policymakers and may have influenced the making of
            policy.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A small amount of material on U.S. policy
            toward Hong Kong is included in the documentation on China, but no attempt was made to
            document relations with the British authorities in Hong Kong.</tei:p>
