    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume focuses on the issues that
            primarily engaged high-level U.S. policymakers. Major topics include: 1) scientific
            issues, including U.S.-Soviet cooperation in outer space, communication satellites, and
            water for peace; 2) selected global issues; and 3) energy problems, especially oil
            policy and the U.S. response to the 1967 oil embargo. The editors also performed
            research on additional issues, such as the European Atomic Energy Community and the
            International Atomic Energy Agency, which might supplement coverage in other volumes on
            the Johnson administration, but determined that the documentary record was mostly
            bilateral and regional and did not warrant separate compilations in this volume.
