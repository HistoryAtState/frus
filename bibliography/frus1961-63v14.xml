    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume presents a comprehensive
            collection of the records of the President's meetings with heads of state and government
            with respect to Berlin. Also presented are records of the principal negotiations on
            policy and military contingency planning regarding Germany and the Berlin crisis that
            took place among the Western Allies as well as with representatives of the Soviet
            Union.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In focusing on the major lines of the
            development of the crisis, the editors have expanded the principles of selection adopted
            for previous volumes documenting the Berlin problem, focusing more extensively on its
            military aspects. As before, they have presented a record of the U.S. reaction and
            response to the major political events within the Federal Republic of Germany insofar as
            they figured directly in ongoing high-level political negotiations. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Intelligence information regarding Soviet
            intentions with respect to Berlin and Germany in general was vitally important during
            the Berlin crisis and found its way into political documents selected for publication.
            The editors did not, however, attempt to document any particular operational activities
            by intelligence authorities in connection with the German problem or to explore the
            scope and impact of intelligence operations. </tei:p>
