        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents the foreign policy of
            the Nixon administration towards Iran and Iraq, 1969–1972, during a period when the
            United States viewed Iran as its staunchest friend in the Persian Gulf region and Iraq
            as a potentially dangerous opponent. Since Iran and Iraq were rivals, Washington’s
            increasingly close ties to Iran widened the gap with Baghdad. </tei:p>
