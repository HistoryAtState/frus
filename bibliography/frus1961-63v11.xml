    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editors of the volume focused much of
            their selection on documenting the most serious U.S.-Soviet confrontation of the Cold
            War, the Cuban missile crisis and its aftermath. Although the crisis itself was short,
            it was so intense that it absorbed the entire attention of President Kennedy and his
            closest advisers. Much of the documentation printed in this volume relates to
            discussions with key Soviet officials through a variety of channels ranging from
            Kennedy-Khrushchev letters to communications through an American newsman with a Soviet
            official. Because of space constraints, the editors have included only the most
            important examples of the frequent and detailed consultation with key allies regarding
            the crisis. </tei:p>
