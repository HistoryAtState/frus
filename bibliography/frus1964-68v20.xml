        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of
            State Dean Rusk were directly involved in the many discussions relating to the
            Arab-Israeli dispute, and the editor tried to document their roles in the policy
            deliberations and decisions as much as possible. Their meetings and correspondence with
            Arab and Israeli leaders, as well as their responses to pressures from both sides to
            provide sophisticated weaponry and their appointments of special emissaries to visit the
            troubled region, for example, are included in the documentary record.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Major topics covered in the volume include:
            U.S. efforts to promote the mediation efforts of UN Special Representative Gunnar
            Jarring, U.S. interest in encouraging negotiations between Israel and Jordan, the
            possibility of a rapprochement between the United States and the United Arab Republic,
            U.S. concern over the possible development of an Israeli nuclear weapons program, and
            the failure of U.S. efforts to limit the flow of arms to the Middle East. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editor included a selection of
            intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level policymakers, especially those
            that were made available to President Johnson. </tei:p>
