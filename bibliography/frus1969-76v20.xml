    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This is the last print volume to document
            U.S. policy towards Southeast Asia, other than those print volumes that document the
            Vietnam War during the Nixon–Ford administrations. For the January 1973 to January 1977
            period, U.S. policy towards Southeast Asia (nations other than Vietnam, Laos, and
            Cambodia) is covered in an electroniconly volume. The decision to cover Thailand, the
            Philippines, and Indonesia for 1969–1972 in detail in this print volume was based on the
            fact that each country was a key ally—either formally or de facto—of the United States
            during the Vietnam war, and each played a specific role during the conflict. Thailand
            sent troops to fight in Vietnam, provided bases for U.S. airpower in Southeast Asia, and
            secretly provided training, troops, and arms to support U.S.-backed guerrilla forces in
            Laos. The Philippines sent a 2,000-man civic action group to South Vietnam, and
            Filipinos made up many of the administrative contractors in South Vietnam. Indonesia
            provided key arms support to the Lon Nol government at a crucial time. In addition,
            Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia were important countries in their own right,
            with key U.S. military and economic assistance programs, large embassies, and close
            relations with the United States. In each country, the United States had a considerable
            interest in their government’s success.</tei:p>
