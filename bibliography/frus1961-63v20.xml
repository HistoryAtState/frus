        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume focuses on U.S. policy
            formulation and diplomacy with regard to the Congo crisis. It includes documentation on
            U.S. support of the U.N. intervention in the Congo, discussions with U.N. authorities,
            U.S. political and economic relations with the Republic of the Congo, U.S. efforts to
            ensure that the Congo Government remained Western-oriented and not Soviet-influenced,
            diplomatic efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Katangan secession, and,
            after the conclusion of the crisis in early 1963, efforts to promote stability in the
            Congo and to bring about the withdrawal of U.N. forces. In general, the emphasis is on
            political developments, including military and intelligence components of such
            developments. Documentation is also included on significant economic concerns, including
            the possible use of economic sanctions to end the Katangan secession. U.S. logistical
            support to U.N. forces in the Congo is not documented except insofar as it raises policy
            issues, nor is the implementation of U.S. economic aid to the Congo.</tei:p>
