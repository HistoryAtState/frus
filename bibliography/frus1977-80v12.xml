        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration. The focus of this volume is on
            the Carter administration’s approach to events in Afghanistan during the buildup of the
            Soviet Union’s presence in that country beginning in early 1978 and culminating in the
            large scale invasion of Soviet troops at the end of 1979. Officials in the Carter
            administration regarded Soviet actions as among the most flagrant violations of
            international norms during the Cold War. The volume is arranged chronologically, with
            the majority of documents concentrated around the crisis period during the lead-up to
            the invasion, and during the aftermath, when the Carter administration formulated a
            range of policy responses to challenge the Soviet Union’s domination of
            Afghanistan.</tei:p>
