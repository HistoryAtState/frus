        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume focuses on the issues that
            primarily engaged high-level U.S. policymakers. The portion of the volume concerning the
            Organization and Management of Foreign Policy focuses on several important issues:
            efforts to improve the management of the Department of State and strengthen its overall
            direction and coordination of U.S. foreign policy; the increasingly informal operation
            of the National Security Council and the enhanced role of the National Security Adviser
            and his staff; problems confronted by the Director of Central Intelligence in
            coordinating the intelligence community, exercising influence over the National
            Reconnaissance Office, and advising the President; and the reexamination of the approval
            process for covert actions. The portion of the volume covering the United Nations
            focuses principally on the Article 19 dispute over financing United Nations peacekeeping
            efforts and on the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force for Cyprus. Other
            topics include the reelection of U Thant as UN Secretary General in 1966, developmental
            and trusteeship issues, the Celestial Bodies Treaty of 1967, and the appointment of U.S.
            Permanent Representatives by President Johnson. Several major issues considered by the
            United Nations during the Johnson Presidency are documented in other Foreign Relations
            volumes: the Vietnam war, volumes I-VII; Arms Control and Disarmament, volume XI; the
            Arab-Israeli Crisis and 1967 War, volume XIX; South Asia, volume XXV; and China, volume
            XXX.</tei:p>
