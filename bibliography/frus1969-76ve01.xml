    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents the foreign policy of
            the Nixon administration concerning global issues, sometimes also called transnational
            issues. The table of contents provides the best idea of the kinds of issues documented
            by this topical, global issues volume: terrorism, hijacking, and other attacks on civil
            aviation; international narcotics control; international cooperation in space;
            international environmental policy; and oceans policy. This is by no means a complete
            list of the global issues that the Nixon administration confronted. Others, such as
            energy, disarmament, refugees, and human rights, will be covered in separate volumes in
            the 1969–1976 subseries. During the period covered in this volume, there were a number
            of refugee problems that resulted from regional conflicts or civil wars; however, the
            Nixon administration usually approached such refugee problems individually, rather than
            dealing with them as part of a global problem. Although not then considered to be a
            major factor in general U.S. foreign policy, human rights violations—especially the
            question of religious persecution—surfaced repeatedly during the period from 1969 to
            1972. Again, the Nixon administration approached the problem bilaterally rather than
            multilaterally. Any attempt to link human rights into a single compilation with some
            ideological or philosophical coherence would not represent how contemporary policy
            makers conceived the issue. It is the opinion of the editors that this volume covers the
            era most faithfully by focusing on those topics that the first Nixon administration
            recognized as distinctly global issues and dealt with on a transnational basis. Topics
            treated primarily on a bilateral or regional basis can be found in other volumes in this
            subseries. </tei:p>
