    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the
            foreign policy decision making of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. This
            volume addresses the administration’s response to the crisis and 1982 war between
            Argentina and the United Kingdom over the South Atlantic island territories of the
            Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands. It
            charts the development of the Anglo-Argentine sovereignty dispute which, from the U.S.
            perspective, was transformed by the Argentine landings on the Falklands (Malvinas) and
            South Georgia in March–April 1982 from a persistent, though peripheral, boundary issue
            to a formidable diplomatic challenge, with geopolitical implications that threatened to
            transcend the narrow geography of the South Atlantic. This violent clash between a
            powerful, if problematic, regional partner and one of the United States’ closest allies,
            prompted a further clash within the U.S. foreign policymaking establishment as
            administration officials balanced the costs of the conflict for U.S. interests in the
            Western Hemisphere against the risks of undermining the Western Alliance. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume documents the intense diplomatic
            efforts, undertaken largely by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr., to broker a
            peaceful resolution to the conflict before it escalated further and, when this proved
            unsuccessful, to manage the outcome of the war and limit its damage. Moreover, it also
            looks at the war’s aftermath and the U.S. perception of its impact, U.S. postwar
            relations with the belligerents, and the conflict’s damaging effect on U.S.-Latin
            American relations. In doing so, the volume also examines the significant influence
            exerted by the lingering Falklands (Malvinas) sovereignty dispute upon the Reagan
            administration’s attempts to normalize political, economic, and military relations with
            Argentina between the end of the war and the re-establishment of civilian government in
            December 1983.</tei:p>
