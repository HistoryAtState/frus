        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Document selection for this volume proceeded
            on the basis of a research plan developed by the editors after a preliminary review of
            repositories in both governmental and private agencies. From the outset the editors also
            approached their research with the recognition of the need to supplement the written
            record of U.S. policy during the Vietnam war with interviews of officials who
            participated in the policy process. Early attention was also given to those oral history
            interviews of participants already in existence and available in various
            locations.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">On the basis of their preliminary research
            and the review of already-published documentation, including the Pentagon Papers of
            1971, the editors developed the following five major general areas of focus for the
            research and selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1) Discussion and
            formulation of policy in Washington; 2) Policy implementation; 3) Reports from the
            Embassy in Saigon; 4) U.S. military involvement in Vietnam; and 5) Intelligence
            activities. </tei:p>
