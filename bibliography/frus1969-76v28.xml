        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume contains four chapters (entitled
            Regional Issues, Portuguese Africa, Angola, and Independence Negotiations), each
            documenting a segment of U.S. policy toward Southern Africa during the presidencies of
            Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. The documentation reveals that both presidents pursued
            policies designed to maintain stability in the region and to avoid domestic and
            international criticism of U.S. ties to the white minority regimes in South Africa and
            Southern Rhodesia.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The chapter on Regional Issues covers South
            Africa, which both administrations viewed as a bulwark against Communist expansion in
            the region. The documents illustrate the tensions between the Nixon administration and
            the Congressional Black Caucus and between the administration and the Department of
            State’s Bureau of African Affairs in dealing with South Africa’s apartheid regime. They
            also show a preference by Nixon and Henry Kissinger to avoid direct involvement in the
            growing unrest.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The chapter on Portuguese Africa reflects the
            evolution of U.S. involvement in Angola and Mozambique. Anxious to avoid alienating a
            key NATO partner, the Nixon administration sought to persuade the Portuguese Government
            to address the grievances of the black nationalist movements, while quietly granting
            limited assistance to the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE) and
            National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) leader Holden Roberto. U.S.
            involvement increased dramatically in January 1975, when Portugal granted independence
            to its African colonies. Concerns about Soviet expansion and Cuban involvement led the
            United States to provide covert support to anti-Communist forces in Angola.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The chapter on Angola chronicles the
            continuation of U.S. support to anti-Communist forces after the Portuguese departed in
            November 1975. Despite substantial assistance and support from South Africa, Zaire,
            Zambia, and others, the U.S. was unable to turn the tide in Angola. Congressional
            passage of the Tunney Amendment in December 1975 cut off aid to Angola and effectively
            ended U.S. support.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The chapter on independence negotiations
            chronicles Kissinger’s effort to broker a negotiated settlement to the conflicts in
            Namibia and Southern Rhodesia.</tei:p>
