        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume, the final of five covering
            relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Nixon-Ford
            administrations, presents documentation on how matters as diverse as strategic arms
            limitation, European security, the Middle East, Jewish emigration, and Angola
            intersected to influence the course of Soviet-American relations during the presidency
            of Gerald R. Ford. Documents published here reveal that Secretary of State Henry
            Kissinger retained the central role in the formulation and implementation of foreign
            policy on the Soviet Union that he occupied during the Nixon administration and that his
            influence remained undiminished in meetings between Ford and Soviet leader Leonid
            Brezhnev at Vladivostok in 1974 and at Helsinki in 1975. The volume devotes considerable
            space to the struggle in Washington between politicians and policymakers over détente,
            and in particular the October 1974 negotiations leading to the so-called Jackson-Vanik
            amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which linked the extension of most favored nation
            status to an increase in Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union. These negotiations
            highlighted the domestic political implications of détente. Although the Secretary of
            State was the driving force in Soviet affairs, the documents reveal that President Ford
            also played an important role in policy making. While Ford supported Kissinger’s
            objectives, he also advocated close consultation with Congress, demonstrating that
            Ford—at least in style, if not in substance—pursued anything but a continuation of his
            predecessor’s approach to foreign policy.</tei:p>
