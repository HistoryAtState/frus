        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents the Nixon
            administration’s primarily multilateral arms control policy between 1969 and 1972. It
            does not cover the high profile Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) with the Soviet
            Union, culminating in the signing of the SALT agreements in May 1972. These negotiations
            are covered in Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Vol. XXXII, SALT I, 1969–1972. While the
            Nixon administration’s arms control policies have become synonymous with SALT, the SALT
            negotiations were actually just one of a panoply of historic arms control and
            disarmament initiatives that the Nixon administration pursued between 1969 and 1972.
            This volume focuses on the administration’s multilateral arms control policies, most
            notably its review of biological and chemical warfare policies, ratification of the
            Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, negotiation of the Seabed Arms Control Treaty,
            approach to nuclear testing and test-ban proposals, and ratification of the Geneva
            Protocol. Most of these negotiations were played out in international arenas such as the
            Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee (ENDC) and its successor, the Conference of the
            Committee on Disarmament (CCD), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the
            United Nations, but the documents here show they were fundamentally U.S.-Soviet
            dialogues, part of the cold war superpower struggle that underlay much of United States
            diplomacy at the time.</tei:p>
