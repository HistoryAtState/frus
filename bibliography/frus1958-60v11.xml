        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume presents a selection of the most
            important documents dealing with diplomatic, political, and military aspects of U.S.
            policy toward Lebanon and Jordan during the final three years of the Eisenhower
            administration. It focuses on the 1958 crisis that led to the introduction of U.S.
            forces into Lebanon and British forces into Jordan.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Documents contain discussions,
            recommendations, decisions, and the flow of information that constituted the
            policymaking process in Washington during the crises that occurred in Lebanon and
            Jordan. In particular, the decisions that led to the introduction of U.S. military
            forces in Lebanon in July and U.S. support for the British landings in Jordan shortly
            thereafter are traced from the background considerations that took place during the 6
            months preceding the crises to the aftermath assessments following the withdrawal of the
            troops in October and November. Documents also include senior-level military decisions
            on the planning and implementation of military operations in Lebanon and the eastern
            Mediterrean theater.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cable traffic between Washington and Beirut
            and Amman provides the most important source of documentation on the extensive
            negotiations that were conducted with the governments of Lebanon and Jordan over
            military support for the two countries. Most of the negotiations with the government of
            Lebanese President Camille Chamoun and the Jordanian government of King Hussein were
            conducted, on instructions from Washington, by Ambassador Robert McClintock in Beirut
            and Chargé Thomas Wright in Amman. Under Secretary of State Robert Murphy assisted those
            efforts during a special mission to the Middle East.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Memoranda, letters, telegrams, and other
            documents record the close coordination of U.S. policy with the British government of
            Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. This coordination involved a steady stream of
            communication between Washington and London, visits such as Foreign Secretary Selwyn
            Lloyd’s to Washington in July, and telephone calls and letters exchanged directly
            between President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Following the end of the crises and the
            withdrawal of U.S. and British forces in the autumn of 1958, U.S. policymakers continued
            to be concerned about the political and economic viability of Lebanon and Jordan. Jordan
            was believed to be particularly vulnerable, thus requiring high-level consideration. In
            general, however, officials in the Department of State and the Embassies in Beirut and
            Amman took over the watch. The President did become involved on occasion, as when King
            Hussein visited Washington in 1959 and 1960, but in the normal course of events the
            relations between the United States and Lebanon and Jordan were defined and maintained
            through the cables that passed between Washington and Beirut and Amman.</tei:p>
