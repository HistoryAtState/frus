    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Department of State released today a
            portion of <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</tei:hi>,
            1977‒1980, Volume XXIV, South America; Latin America Region. The two compilations
            released today, on Argentina and the Latin America Region, were given priority in the
            declassification process as part of the National Security Council-led Argentina
            Declassification Project. Unedited versions of these documents were made available in
            April 2017 as part of an earlier release. Today’s publication includes additional
            information on the provenance and context of the documents. The release of the complete
            volume in 2018 will include compilations on U.S. policy toward nine more countries in
            South America and the front matter of the volume.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            in the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the
            foreign policy of the Carter administration. The compilations released today show
            high-level U.S. concern over human rights violations in the Southern Cone and policy
            debates within the U.S. Government over what exactly to do about those violations.
            Carter’s policy toward Argentina sought to promote human rights, moderate the internal
            dynamics of the ruling <tei:hi rend="italic">junta</tei:hi>, and encourage the
            reestablishment of electoral democracy and an orderly end to the military government
            that had taken power in March 1976. At the same time, U.S. officials tried to calm
            disputes between Argentina and its neighbors, limit the spread of developing nuclear
            technology, encourage the stabilization and growth of the Argentine economy, and, in
            1980, ensure Argentine cooperation in the grain embargo that the United States had
            placed on the Soviet Union.</tei:p>
