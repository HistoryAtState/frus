    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume has three chapters: U.S.
            relations with Greece; the U.S. response to the Cyprus issue, which erupted into a
            crisis with the Turkish invasion of the eastern portion of the island in mid-1974; and
            U.S. relations with Turkey. The chapters on Greece and Turkey focus on bilateral
            relations and events in those countries. The chapter on Cyprus documents a multilateral
            relationship among Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greece, Turkey, the United Nations, Great
            Britain, and the United States. Experts in Washington feared that Greece and Turkey, two
            NATO members already at odds over oil exploration in the Aegean Sea, might go to war
            over Cyprus and destroy NATO’s southern flank. The Cyprus chapter, therefore, has a high
            component of contingency planning and intelligence assessments and is documented in
            greater detail than the other two chapters. Where Greece or Turkey had an interest in
            Cyprus, the documentation is placed in the Cyprus chapter, although it was sometimes
            impossible to separate bilateral issues from Cyprus.</tei:p>
