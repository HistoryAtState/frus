        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume includes numerous direct personal
            communications between President Richard Nixon and Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev
            covering a host of issues, including clarifying the practical application of the SALT I
            and AMB agreements signed in Moscow. Other major themes covered include the war in
            Indochina, arms control, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),
            commercial relations and most-favored-nation status, grain sales, the emigration of
            Soviet Jews, Jackson-Vanik legislation, and the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
            High-level meetings and summits, both in the United States and the Soviet Union, are
            documented in detail, including Assistant for National Security Affairs Henry
            Kissinger's conversations with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko leading up to
            Nixon's final visit to the Soviet Union in June 1974. </tei:p>
