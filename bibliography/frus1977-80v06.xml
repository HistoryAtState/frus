        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration. The focus of this volume is on
            U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union during the Carter administration, demonstrating the
            growing tension between U.S. and Soviet leaders and the eventual downfall of détente.
            Relations with the Soviet Union remained at the top of Carter’s foreign policy agenda,
            just as they had been in the Nixon and Ford administrations. However, the U.S.
            relationship with the Soviet Union was never simply bilateral in nature; instead, the
            two super powers were actively engaged politically throughout the world. Therefore, this
            volume includes documentation on the Middle East, China, Eastern and Western Europe, and
            the Horn, as well as SALT, emigration, and human rights.</tei:p>
