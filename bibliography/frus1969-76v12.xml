        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Nixon administration presented a pressing
            argument to look at the U.S.-Soviet relationship in its broadest, global context.
            President Nixon created a secret, private channel of dialogue and negotiation between
            the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs, Henry A. Kissinger, and the
            Soviet Ambassador in Washington, Anatoly F. Dobrynin. The documentary record of the
            establishment and early use of that channel is presented in its entirety in this volume.
            In his relations with Moscow, President Nixon insisted on linkage of other issues with
            improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations. This volume highlights U.S.-Soviet interaction in
            the negotiations for a Middle East settlement, the role that the United States expected
            the Soviet Union to play in ending the Vietnam war, challenges to the U.S.-Soviet
            relationship in light of the Sino-Soviet border dispute, and the concern over Soviet
            strategic nuclear developments, such as the SS–9, in beginning Strategic Arms Limitation
            Talks. This expanded interaction between the two superpowers required a redesign of
            Foreign Relations coverage of the Soviet Union. The number of documents printed and the
            scope of their content were greatly expanded. There are five volumes for the Soviet
            Union within the Nixon-Ford subseries, 1969–1976, three of which document the crucial
            first Nixon administration. These volumes document U.S.-Soviet relations worldwide and
            more accurately reflect the global nature of the Cold War.</tei:p>
