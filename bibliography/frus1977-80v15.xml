        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Carter administration’s policy toward
            Central America stressed human rights and non-interventionism with an aim to expand
            democracy in the region. Carter’s diplomats worked with Guatemala and Belize to secure a
            basis for Belize’s future independence from the United Kingdom. In Nicaragua, the Carter
            administration sought to advance political moderation as the Sandinista National
            Liberation Front rose against President Anastasio Somoza. After July 1979, Carter
            offered aid and counsel to the Government of National Reconstruction. Bilateral
            relations with Costa Rica were dominated by the events in Nicaragua due to Costa Rica’s
            territorial proximity, and then by the political situation in El Salvador. In Honduras,
            the United States advised the military Junta government to hold elections and broaden
            the representation within the government. In El Salvador, a military government faced
            growing popular opposition from the political left and right. Carter opted to offer
            military and economic aid in exchange for improvements in human rights practices and
            progress toward open elections. </tei:p>
