    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume presents records that explain the
            formulation of U.S. Government policies toward Africa as a whole and the individual
            regions and states of Africa during the Eisenhower administration. The decisions of and
            recommendations to President Dwight D. Eisenhower regarding these policies are fully
            documented as are the discussions and actions of the National Security Council. The
            policy options considered or adopted by the Secretary of State and the most important of
            his actions to implement Presidential decisions are also comprehensively
            documented.</tei:p>

        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Correspondence and other exchanges between
            the U.S. Government and the nations of Africa, nations with interests in Africa, and
            with the United Nations were included to document the main lines of policy
            implementation on major issues and to indicate the important items of information that
            attended Presidential decisions and policy recommendations by the Secretary of State.
            The volume also includes intelligence reports and estimates and reports from diplomatic
            posts that had, or may have had, some impact on the making of major policies.</tei:p>

        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The amount of documentation devoted to
            Sub-Saharan Africa is substantially larger than in previous volumes of the Foreign
            Relations series, reflecting the increased attention that U.S. policymakers had to give
            to the region as many African countries attained independence in the 1958–1960
            period.</tei:p>

        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">More than half the volume is devoted to the
            Congo crisis, which began in mid-1960. Another major portion of the volume provides key
            documentation on U.S. policies toward Africa in a regional context. Those sections
            include documentation concerning general policy toward Africa, the recognition of
            newly-independent states, and policy concerning the Horn of Africa. Separate
            compilations are devoted to Ghana, Guinea, and South Africa, each of which presented
            policy issues of broad significance. Guinea raised the problem of recognition of a
            country that had unilaterally chosen independence, when the former colonial power was
            discouraging international recognition. Delay in U.S. recognition and establishment of
            diplomatic relations troubled relations with Guinea and demonstrated the futility of
            such an approach. U.S. relations with Ghana’s President Kwame Nkrumah and Guinea’s
            President Sekou Touré posed the problem of dealing with left-leaning third-world
            governments. South Africa, with its system of apartheid, raised policy issues of
            long-term significance with implications for U.S. policy toward other regimes in
            southern Africa. Documentation on policies toward other African countries is included in
            the regional compilations.</tei:p>
