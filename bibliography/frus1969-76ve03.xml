        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents United States policy
            concerning global/transnational issues during the Nixon and Ford administrations:
            Antarctic resource exploitation, international drug control, human rights, oceans
            policy, space and telecommunications, and terrorism. Additional global issues, including
            energy, disarmament, food policy, population control, and women’s issues are treated in
            other volumes in the 1969–1976 subseries. During the period covered in this volume, a
            number of refugee problems resulting from regional conflicts or civil wars occurred, but
            the Nixon administration usually approached those incidents individually rather than as
            phenomena requiring an overarching policy. It is the opinion of the editors that this
            volume recounts the era faithfully by focusing on those topics that the second Nixon and
            Ford administrations recognized as global issues and dealt with as worldwide phenomena.
            Issues treated primarily as bilateral or regional matters can be found in other volumes
            in this subseries.</tei:p>
