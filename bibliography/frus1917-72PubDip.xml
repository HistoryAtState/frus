    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This is the first chapter in a retrospective
            volume which will augment the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                States</tei:hi> series’ coverage of U.S. public diplomacy. While the series began to
            document the subject in a sustained and concerted way starting with the second
            administration of President Richard M. Nixon, previous <tei:hi rend="italic"
                >FRUS</tei:hi> coverage of U.S. public diplomacy efforts have been far less
            consistent. This retrospective volume will fill that gap, which stretches from the First
            World War to the early 1970s. This compilation covers World War I; subsequent
            compilations, which will document up to the end of the first Nixon administration, will
            be published as they are completed. The compilation also features the first inclusion of
            film in a <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</tei:hi> volume. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This compilation focuses on the creation and
            overseas work of the Committee on Public Information (CPI). While the U.S. Government
            had engaged in public diplomacy before (such as with the publication of diplomatic
            correspondence during the Civil War), the CPI’s foreign work constituted a sustained
            effort to educate a foreign public about the United States, and, in particular, its role
            in the war effort. Representatives of the CPI were sent around the globe to establish
            reading rooms, distribute translated copies of President Woodrow Wilson’s speeches, work
            with local journalists to publish news stories, and show films demonstrating the United
            States’ readiness to fight. This compilation documents all of these activities. While
            few planning documents from the time exist, this compilation includes numerous examples
            of how the CPI executed its work in the field, particularly in Europe, Asia, and Latin
            America. The compilation also includes examples of the types of information distributed
            by the CPI.</tei:p>
