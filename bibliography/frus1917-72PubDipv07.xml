        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents the efforts of the
        Lyndon B. Johnson administration to craft public diplomacy and information policy during the
        middle period of the Cold War. A major emphasis is on the various ways the United States
        Information Agency (USIA) presented U.S. foreign policy objectives to global audiences
        during a time of great social upheaval within the United States, particularly during the
        Civil Rights movement. It also describes how the Johnson administration ensured both USIA
        and the Department of State utilized a variety of public diplomacy tools in the face of
        numerous crises that defined the 1960s. These crises included the assassination of John F.
        Kennedy and transition to the Johnson administration, the Dominican Republic intervention,
        the ongoing nuclear test-ban treaty negotiations, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia,
        and, most significant, the Vietnam war, which was a dominant focus through Johnson’s
        presidency. Additional documentation chronicles the Johnson administration’s attempts to
        reassure the world of U.S. stability following Kennedy’s death, to promote a domestic policy
        during a period of tumult and great cultural change, and to advance the Department of
        State’s educational exchange activities, particularly with the Soviet Union and the
        developing world. </tei:p>
