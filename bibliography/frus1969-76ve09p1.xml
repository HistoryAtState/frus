        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a <tei:hi
                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> subseries that documents the most important
            foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations. The
            focus of this volume is on the relationship between the United States and North Africa
            during the Nixon and Ford administrations from 1973 until 1976. The Maghreb presented
            opportunities and challenges for both the Nixon and Ford administrations as they sought
            to broker settlements to conflicts in the Middle East and to limit Soviet exploitation
            of tensions in the region. Stability in the Maghreb was considered vital to achieving
            these goals, but proved increasingly difficult to attain due to Libya’s actions in the
            region and the destabilizing impact of Spain’s withdrawal from the Spanish
            Sahara.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Documents on North Africa, 1973–1976, covers
            efforts by both administrations to re-establish diplomatic relations with Algeria and
            provide support and reassurance to moderate Arab allies Morocco and Tunisia. It also
            covers the various attempts to manage relations with Libya’s Mu’ammar Qadhafi. Finally,
            the volume documents Secretary of State Kissinger’s efforts to de-escalate growing
            tensions among Spain, Morocco, and Algeria following Spain’s May 1975 announcement that
            it would transfer sovereignty of Spanish Sahara.</tei:p>
