        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Document selection for this volume proceeded
            on the basis of a research plan developed by the editors after a preliminary review of
            repositories in both governmental and private agencies. From the outset the editors
            approached their research realizing the need to supplement the written record of U.S.
            policy during the Vietnam war with interviews of officials who participated in the
            policy process. Early attention was also given to those oral history interviews of
            participants already in existence and available in various locations. Oral history
            citations are provided in the footnotes to the text. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">On the basis of their preliminary research
            and review of already-published documentation, including the 1971 "Pentagon Papers," the
            editors developed the following five areas of focus for the research and selection of
            documents for inclusion in this volume: 1) Discussion and formulation of policy in
            Washington; 2) Policy implementation in South Vietnam; 3) The relationship among the
            United States Government, the Diem government, and dissident elements in South Vietnam;
            4) U.S. intelligence assessments of the viability of the Diem government and the
            prospects of potential coup plotters; and 5) U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
