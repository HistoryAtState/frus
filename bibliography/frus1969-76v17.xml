    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume documents the lead up to the
            initial Kissinger visit to Beijing in July 1971, his next visit in October 1971, and
            President Nixon’s historic visit of February 1972. Through a variety of sources—
            telegrams, memoranda, memoranda of conversation, telephone conversations, transcripts of
            Presidential tape recordings, and briefing books with extensive handwritten annotation
            by Nixon—the volume documents how the President wanted Kissinger initially to engage the
            Chinese. Kissinger’s conversations in Beijing are covered in detail and the excitement
            that he felt during this first trip clearly comes through the official record. It is not
            difficult to see that Kissinger believed he had a special bond with Chinese Premier Chou
            En-lai. The October 1971 trip by Kissinger is also covered in detail with similar
            documentation. The volume contains extensive documentation on President Nixon’s February
            1972 trip and the issuing of the Shanghai Communiqué. After the Nixon visit, the United
            States sought to regularize its contacts with the People’s Republic of China, and this
            process is documented in the last chapter on China that includes documentation on
            Kissinger’s June 1972 visit to Beijing.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Although the volume concentrates heavily on
            the People’s Republic of China, there is considerable documentation on U.S. relations
            with the Republic of China during the 1969–1972 period. There is also documentation on a
            government-wide reexamination of U.S.-PRC relations that served as background to the
            more far-reaching decisions taken in secret by Kissinger and the President.</tei:p>
