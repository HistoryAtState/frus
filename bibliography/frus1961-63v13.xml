    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In selecting documents for inclusion in
            volume XIII, the editors recognized the predominant role of the Department of State in
            formulating policy with respect to Western Europe and Canada. This volume focuses on the
            many meetings of the Secretary of State with his advisers and with representatives of
            the White House and other agencies, as well as the written advice to the Secretary of
            State from these advisers. The editors have included internal U.S. Government policy
            recommenda- tions and decision papers relating to Western Europe and Canada. They have
            also included the advice and recommendations on foreign policy issues from top-level
            military commanders and advisers with regard to NATO. In focusing on the major lines of
            policy development toward Western Europe and Canada, the editors have also presented a
            record of the U.S. reaction and response to the major political events within France,
            Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Canada insofar as they figured directly
            in ongoing high-level political negotiations. </tei:p>
