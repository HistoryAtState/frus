    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a subseries of volumes
            of the <tei:hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</tei:hi> series that documents the most
            important issues in the foreign policy of the Nixon and Ford administrations. The volume
            documents the Panama Canal treaty negotiations from January 1973 until December of 1976,
            focusing on Ellsworth Bunker’s efforts to create a series of threshold agreements with
            the Panamanians based loosely on the Kissinger-Tack Principles of 1974. The volume also
            documents Congressional challenges to the negotiations with the Panamanians, as well as
            discussions between the Department of State and the Department of Defense regarding the
            breadth of Bunker’s negotiation instructions. The volume highlights the tension between
            the executive and legislative branches of government in the construction of foreign
            policy, the tension between different government agencies during the negotiation of a
            landmark treaty, the dialogue between the United States and a smaller but strategically
            valuable non-aligned state, as well as the Nixon and Ford administrations’ view of Latin
            America and its place in U.S. foreign policy.</tei:p>
