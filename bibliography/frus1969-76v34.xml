        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume documents U.S. national security
            policy in the context of the Vietnam War and the changing Cold War strategic balance
            between the United States and the Soviet Union. When President Richard Nixon assumed
            office in January 1969, he was confronted with the fact that the United States no longer
            held commanding military superiority over its superpower rival. Since the end of his
            stint as Vice President in 1961, the Soviets had achieved a rough strategic parity that
            left the United States with “significant vulnerabilities” vis-à-vis the USSR. This
            volume documents the Nixon administration’s efforts to grapple with this new strategic
            situation and provides coverage of the following: The administration’s review of U.S.
            nuclear and general purpose forces and strategic doctrine; its attempts to ascertain the
            level of technological sophistication achieved by the Soviet missile program; and its
            decision to deploy Safeguard, a modified anti-ballistic missile system. The volume also
            examines chemical and biological weapons policy; U.S. nuclear policy in Asia; the
            evolution of the administration’s strategic priorities in light of an ever-shrinking
            defense budget; and the transition from military conscription to an all-volunteer armed
            force. Additionally, the volume provides previously unreleased material regarding the
            October 1969 Joint Chiefs of Staff Readiness Test, in which Nixon secretly placed on
            alert portions of the United States military, including its nuclear forces. Throughout
            this volume, a consistent theme is the relationship between military strength and
            diplomatic strength; in particular, the importance of military might—real or
            perceived—to the United States’ ability to maintain credibility in the eyes of allies
            and adversaries alike.</tei:p>
