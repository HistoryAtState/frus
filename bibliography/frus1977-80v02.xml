        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume is part of a Foreign Relations
            subseries that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the
            administration of Jimmy Carter. It illustrates the Carter administration’s efforts to
            define and implement a broad-based human rights policy, including the establishment of
            the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs within the Department of State, the
            creation of human rights coordinating and review groups, issuance of a Presidential
            Directive on human rights, institutionalization and standardization of human rights
            reporting, and pursuit of human rights within the United Nations and other multilateral
            venues. The volume also documents steps undertaken by the Carter administration to fight
            hunger, launch a global health initiative, and advocate for women’s rights.</tei:p>
