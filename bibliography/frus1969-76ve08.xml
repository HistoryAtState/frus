        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This e-volume documents the foreign policy of
            the Nixon-Ford administration toward South Asia, 1973–1976, and should be read in
            conjunction with Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume E–7, Documents on South Asia,
            1969–1972, and Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume XI, South Asia Crisis, 1971 (GPO:
            Washington, March 2005; ISBN 0–16–072401–5). Both of these volumes document in depth the
            period of the Nixon administration, including the pivotal months of the India-Pakistan
            conflict of 1971 and its aftermath. Taken together, these three volumes provide
            comprehensive coverage of U.S. policy toward India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and
            Bangladesh. In contrast with the previous volumes on South Asia during the Nixon
            administration, which were focused more tightly on the subcontinent’s crises, volume E–8
            also provides detailed coverage of the smaller South Asian states of Nepal, Bhutan, and
            Sri Lanka, and the Indian Ocean region, including the Republic of the Maldives. Read in
            conjunction with Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume XXIV, 1969–1972 (GPO:
            forthcoming), this volume will also provide comprehensive coverage of U.S. Indian Ocean
            strategy during 1969-1976.</tei:p>
