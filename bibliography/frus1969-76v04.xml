        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Because of their ongoing preoccupation with
            international political and strategic policy, President Nixon and his Assistant for
            National Security Affairs, Henry Kissinger, expressed less interest in foreign economic
            matters than in Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the opening to China. They nonetheless
            understood that domestic and foreign economic developments could have a profound effect
            on their political programs and goals, particularly with respect to the industrial
            democracies, the developing countries, especially those in Latin America, and the
            Communist countries. The first compilations in this volume focus on President Nixon's
            interest in developing bold and flexible foreign assistance and development policies
            (such as utilization of the private sector for foreign direct investment, which included
            the establishment of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation) and the
            administration's responses to the bureaucratic interplay among the concerned government
            departments and agencies and to the resistance from the Office of Management and Budget
            and Congress toward its proposed funding levels. A related compilation treats the
            emergence of an administration policy involving sanctions in reaction to the
            expropriation of U.S. properties without reasonable compensation by expropriating
            governments, particularly those of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">On trade policy, the administration resisted
            reverse tariff preferences by the European Community involving discrimination against
            U.S. exports and Congressional protectionist pressures, with some major exceptions such
            as textiles. Nonetheless the administration sought broad new trade negotiating
            authority, including a program for a generalized system of preferences for developing
            countries, a program that became particularly important in the resolution of the
            monetary crisis in late 1972 when trade issues were inexorably linked to international
            monetary reform. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Emphasizing "linkage" of trade issues with
            the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the Nixon administration at first refrained from
            liberalization of East-West trade, but by mid-1971 President Nixon accepted proposals
            for increased trade of non-strategic goods with the People's Republic of China and other
            Communist nations. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The final compilation documents the
            administration's policies toward the U.S. stockpile of strategic materials and the
            negotiation of multilateral agreements on grains, cotton, wool, sugar, and other
            commodities. </tei:p>
