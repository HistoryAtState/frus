        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This volume focuses on the formulation of
            policy by the Eisenhower administration and on the most significant U.S. diplomatic,
            economic, and military relationships with foreign governments in Western Europe.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During the years 1958–1960, the Department of
            State had a leading role in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Europe and Canada.
            Secretaries of State John Foster Dulles and Christian A. Herter drew upon the
            Department’s expertise in advising President Eisenhower and in taking leading roles in
            the deliberations of the National Security Council. The Department of State prepared and
            coordinated exchanges of views and discussions of diverse foreign policy matters with
            the French, Italian, and British Governments and participated in the nearly 20 heads of
            government meetings between President Eisenhower and the leaders of the European states.
            For the most part the Department of State took the initiative in managing foreign
            relations with the smaller countries of Europe and obtained White House approval only
            for an occasional major issue.</tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume includes memoranda of conversation
            between Secretaries of State Dulles and Herter and their European and Canadian
            counterparts, internal U.S. Government policy recommendations, and decision papers
            relating to relations with these countries and the several European regional
            organizations, particularly NATO. Telegrams document the important policy
            recommendations of U.S. representatives at the Missions in Western Europe. National
            Security Council memoranda of discussion, policy papers, and other institutional
            records, as well as more informal foreign policy materials, document U.S. policies
            toward NATO, Canada, and the countries of Western Europe. The volume also includes
            policy recommendations by the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding various major foreign
            affairs policies.</tei:p>
