    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume focuses on the German issues that
            primarily engaged high-level U.S. policymakers: 1) U.S. efforts to retain a privileged
            relationship with the Federal Republic of Germany's leadership; 2) the attempts of U.S.
            policymakers to provide carefully measured support for West German initiatives aimed at
            achieving national reunification, including its emerging Ostpolitik; 3) U.S. efforts to
            secure a larger offset payment by the Federal Republic of Germany to cover the costs of
            maintaining U.S. forces in Europe; 4) the desire of the United States to secure West
            German support for a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; 5) U.S.-French differences over
            policy toward Germany; and 6) the development of policy toward the Berlin
            question.</tei:p>
