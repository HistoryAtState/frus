        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of
            State Rusk were directly involved in the many discussions relating to the Arab-Israeli
            dispute, and the editor tried to document their roles in the policy deliberations and
            decisions as much as possible. Their meetings and correspondence with Arab and Israeli
            leaders, as well as their responses to pressures from both sides to provide
            sophisticated weaponry and their appointments of special emissaries to visit the
            troubled region, for example, are included in the documentary record. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Major topics covered in the volume include:
            1) U.S. efforts to continue the preceding Kennedy administration's policy of trying to
            foster more friendly relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic (UAR)
            while maintaining good relations with Israel; 2) mounting tensions in the area, fueled
            by terrorist attacks on Israel and the flow of Soviet arms to the UAR, which undercut
            this approach and led to the U.S. decision to provide increasingly sophisticated
            armaments to Israel and Jordan; 3) the deteriorating U.S. relations with the UAR as a
            result of the UAR's intervention in Yemen and Nasser's criticisms of U.S. policies,
            which annoyed President Johnson and stirred Congressional opposition to economic
            assistance; and 4) the continuing U.S. efforts, despite these irritants, to pursue an
            even-handed approach to the Arab-Israeli dispute, prevent an arms race in advanced
            weapons in the area, and seek to defuse the increasingly frequent incidents on Israel's
            borders from flaring into full-scale war. The volume concludes on the brink of the
            crisis that preceded the Six Day War; the crisis and resulting war are documented in
            volume XIX. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editor included a selection of
            intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level policymakers, especially those
            that were made available to President Johnson. </tei:p>
