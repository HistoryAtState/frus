            between President Johnson and Soviet leaders, including the Glassboro Summit in 1967;
            (2) Chairman Khrushchev's ouster in 1964 and its consequences for U.S.-Soviet relations;
            (3) assessments of Khrushchev's successors; (4) the impact of the Vietnam war on
            U.S.-Soviet relations; (5) discussions of bilateral issues, including arms control,
            trade, cultural exchanges, the Civil Air Agreement, the Consular Convention, the
            defection of Stalin's daughter, and new embassy sites; and (6) the Johnson
            administration's efforts during 1968 to initiate strategic arms control talks and
            arrange a summit meeting. </tei:p>
