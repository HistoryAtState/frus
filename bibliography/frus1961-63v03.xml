        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Preparation of this volume proceeded in 1984
            on the basis of a research plan developed by the editors after a preliminary review of
            repositories in both governmental and private agencies. From the outset the editors
            approached their research realizing the need to supplement the written record of U.S.
            policy during the Vietnam war with interviews of officials who participated in the
            policy process. They also reviewed those oral history interviews of participants already
            in existence and available in various locations. Oral history citations are provided in
            the footnotes to the text. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">On the basis of their preliminary research
            and review of already published documentation, including the 1971 "Pentagon Papers," the
            editors developed the following six areas of focus for further research and the
            selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1) Discussion and formulation of
            policy in Washington; 2) Policy implementation in South Vietnam; 3) The relationship
            among the United States Government, the Diem government, and dissident elements in South
            Vietnam; 4) The implications of the Buddhist crisis which developed in May; 5) U.S.
            intelligence assessments of the situation in Vietnam and the viability of the Diem
            government and the prospects of a potential coup; and 6) U.S. military involvement in
            Vietnam. The editors did take careful account of the documentation in the "Pentagon
            Papers," but have, in general, sought to avoid reprinting documents already published
            there. </tei:p>
