    <summary>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The volume focuses on the issues that
            primarily engaged high-level U.S. policymakers. Major topics include: 1) the efforts of
            President Johnson and U.S. policymakers to retain a close relationship with the Shah of
            Iran; 2) U.S. attempts to buttress Iran's internal security by encouraging a
            far-reaching program of political, social, and economic reform; 3) the conflict between
            U.S. support for Iranian economic development and reform as a check against internal
            upheaval or revolution and the Shah's insistence on spending more of Iran's growing oil
            revenues on weapons; 4) increased U.S. support for Iran's military modernization
            program; 5) the upsurge of anti-Americanism and opposition to the Shah's government
            following the October 1964 passage of a status of forces bill granting U.S. military
            personnel stationed in Iran and their dependents full diplomatic immunity; 6) U.S.
            efforts to prevent the Shah from buying arms from non-U.S. sources, especially the
            Soviet Union; and 7) U.S. determination to prevent the Soviet Union from gaining a
            foothold in Iran. </tei:p>
        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The editor included a selection of
            intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level policymakers, especially those
            that were sent to President Johnson. </tei:p>
