        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Major topics covered in this volume include:
            1) the U.S. search for a peaceful solution to the crisis that erupted in the Middle East
            in May 1967, including efforts to persuade both sides to avoid military action, and
            attempts after Egypt's closure of the Strait of Tiran to obtain international action to
            guarantee the right of passage by ships of all nations through the Gulf of Aqaba; 2) the
            U.S. desire to avoid involvement in the war that broke out on June 5 and to see it end
            swiftly, including the halting of military shipments to both sides, U.S. support for UN
            Security Council resolutions calling for a cease-fire, and U.S. efforts to persuade
            Israel to comply with the resolutions; 3) the U.S. response to the decision by Egypt and
            some other Arab states to break off relations with the United States and to Egyptian
            charges of U.S. involvement in Israel's air strikes against Egypt; 4) U.S. concern with
            the possibility of Soviet involvement in the war and the exchange of hot-line messages
            between President Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in which Johnson assured
            Kosygin of the U.S. desire for a swift end to the conflict and requested that the Soviet
            Union urge restraint on Egypt and Syria; 5) the U.S. response to the June 8 Israeli
            attack on the USS Liberty in international waters; 6) U.S. support for a comprehensive
            peace settlement in which Israel would exchange the territories it had conquered for
            recognition and secure borders, including U.S. attempts to persuade Israel against
            taking steps that might tend toward making its occupation of the occupied territories
            permanent; 7) the concern of Johnson administration officials with massive Soviet aid to
            Arab countries after the war and its effect on the military balance in the Middle East;
            8) U.S. efforts to bring about a compromise UN Security Council resolution linking
            withdrawal of Israeli forces with mutual recognition and an end to belligerence, leading
            to the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 242 on November 22, 1967. </tei:p>
