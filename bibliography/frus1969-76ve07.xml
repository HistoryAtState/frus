        <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This e-volume documents the foreign policy of
            the Nixon administration toward South Asia, 1969–1972, and should be read in conjunction
            with Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, Volume XI, South Asia Crisis, 1971, which covers in
            depth the period from March to December 1971. Together, these two volumes provide full
            coverage of U.S. policy toward the larger countries of South Asia. For the period
            January 1969 to February 1971 and all of 1972, the e-volume provides full coverage of
            U.S. policy toward India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the newly created state of
            Bangladesh. The e-volume also contains documentation that supplements the print volume
            XI. These additional documents on India and Pakistan for the period March to December
            1971 include intelligence assessments, key messages from the U.S. Embassies in Islamabad
            and New Delhi and the Consulate General in Dacca, responses to National Security Study
            Memoranda, and full transcripts of Presidential tape recordings that are summarized and
            excerpted in editorial notes in volume XI. Documentation on Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan
            is not included in the e-volume. </tei:p>
