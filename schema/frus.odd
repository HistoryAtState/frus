                <p>This document is a set of encoding guidelines for the digital edition of the
                        <title level="s">Foreign Relations of the United States</title> (<title
                        level="s">FRUS</title>) series, the official documentary history of U.S.
                    foreign relations. The basis for encoding <title level="s">FRUS</title> is the
                    Text Encoding Initiative (see <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/"
                        >tei-c.org</ref> for the complete TEI P5 Guidelines). This document
                    describes the project-specific subset of the TEI standard and practices used for
                    encoding <title level="s">FRUS</title>, hereafter called FRUS TEI. The primary
                    purpose of FRUS TEI is to accurately and canonically encode the text of the
                    publication and capture its core structural features, including document
                    headings, datelines, paragraphs, footnotes, page numbers, tables, figures, and
                    indexes. Besides capturing these structural features, each volume is enhanced
                    with by identifying all cross references within the series and encoding them as
                    hyperlinks to facilitate reading. Once encoded according to these guidelines, a
                    FRUS TEI document should validate against the FRUS TEI schema without errors and
                    thus will be compatible with tools for electronically publishing and analyzing
                    the FRUS digital archive, including the Office of the Historian website, ebook
                    catalogs, data feeds, and APIs. These guidelines, written in TEI using the ODD
                    (One Document Does it all) format, provide the following information:</p>

                <p>Although this guide cannot anticipate every situation encoders will encounter,
                    its design allows for new sections or examples to be added as circumstances

                            publication started in 1861 and published more-or-less continuously
                            since then, with nearly 500 books to date, constituting the official
                            documentary history of U.S. foreign relations. While the first books
                            were titled variously, e.g., "Message of the President of the United
                            States to the Two Houses of Congress," "Papers Relating to Foreign
                            Affairs, Accompanying the Annual Message of the President," and "Papers
                            Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States," the series
                            acquired its current name with the publications in the late 1940s
                            covering the 1930s. While the early volumes were published the year
                            following the events described in the book, the series gradually fell
                            behind current events. Now, under a law passed in 1991, volumes must be
                            published 30 years after the events they describe. Another important
                            change was the transition from an annual (in the 1861-1951 volumes) to a
                            triennial (in the 1952-1960 volumes) to a presidential
                            administration-based organization (since 1961).</gloss></item>

                            a dateline, a source note, a body, and other annotations, primarily in
                            the form of footnotes. Recent volumes (since ____) assign a number to
                            each document, incremented sequentially; the document number, rather
                            than page number, is the primary unit for cross references. Before
                            document numbering, page numbers were the unit for cross references.
                            Occasionally, a document is titled "Editorial Note", which are not
                            primary source documents but rather are narrative interventions by the
                            editor. The editor can use editorial notes to summarize a long document
                            or series of documents that could not be printed because of space
                            constraints, or provide important context.</gloss></item>

                            <p>The <gi>body</gi> of the volume contains primary source documents,
                                nested within divisions known as "compilations", "chapters", and
                                sometimes deeper subdivisions. Each of these divisions, and the
                                documents contained within, are wrapped in <gi>div</gi> elements.
                                These <gi>div</gi> elements require <att>xml:id</att> and
                                    <att>type</att> attributes and a child <gi>head</gi> element.
                                Within these general guidelines are practices for each type of

                            <p>Compilation <gi>div</gi>s are always the top level division for the
                                body of a volume. They are given a <att>type</att> value of
                                    <ident>compilation</ident> and an <att>xml:id</att> value
                                consisting of a <ident>comp</ident> prefix and a sequential number
                                relative to the entire volume, e.g., <ident>comp1</ident>,
                                    <ident>comp2</ident>, <ident>comp3</ident>.</p>
                            <p>Chapter <gi>div</gi>s are given a <att>type</att> value of
                                    <ident>chapter</ident> and an <att>xml:id</att> value consisting
                                of a <ident>ch</ident> prefix and a sequential number relative to
                                the entire volume, e.g., <ident>ch1</ident>, <ident>ch2</ident>,
                                    <ident>ch3</ident>.</p>
                            <p>Document <gi>div</gi>s are given a <att>type</att> value of
                                    <ident>document</ident> and an <att>xml:id</att> value
                                consisting of a <ident>d</ident> prefix and a sequential number
                                relative to the entire volume, e.g., <ident>d1</ident>,
                                    <ident>d2</ident>, <ident>d3</ident>. Not all volumes contain
                                explicit document numbers; in this case, sequential document
                                identifiers should be assigned and used for the <att>xml:id</att>
                                attribute, and the <att>n</att> attribute should contain the number
                                in square brackets (e.g., <ident>[3]</ident>).</p>
                            <p>This example demonstrates the nesting of compilation, chapter, and
                                document divisions. Note that the nesting must reflect the hierarchy
                                shown in the table of contents, so use the table of contents as a
                                guide to ensure the nesting structure is correct.</p>

                            coded as <gi>p</gi> elements with <att>rend</att> attributes carrying a
                            value of <ident>sectiontitleital</ident>. Paragraphs may be numbered;
                            these can be distinguished from lists by their indentation: their first
                            line is indented, but subsequent lines are flush left.</p>
                        <p>Also distinguish lists from numbered paragraphs by the amount of
                            non-numbered paragraphs within the block of text. More than two

                            the date is wrapped in a <gi>date</gi> element, with a <att>when</att>
                            attribute with the date expressed in XML Schema date (xs:date) or date

                        <p>The complete dateline is part of the <gi>opener</gi> element, described

                                <gi>seg</gi> element. If preceded by a <gi>seg</gi> element, the
                            dateline should include a <att>rendition</att> attribute specifying

                            For example, in the dateline, "United States Legation, Vienna, October
                            3, 1870. (Received October 26.)" the first date indicates the date of

                            the recipient. Therefore, only the first date is tagged, and the second
                            is left untagged:</p>

                        <p>Signatures are wrapped in a <gi>signed</gi> element inside the document's
                                <gi>closer</gi> element. The <gi>closer</gi> element is rendered as
                            a right-aligned block, so no <att>rend</att> or <att>rendition</att>
                            attribute is needed to achieve right-alignment of the <gi>closer</gi>.
                            Every <gi>signed</gi> element must have at least one <gi>persName</gi>

                            the volume. Typically, the person names in FRUS signature blocks are set
                            in bold text in the print edition, so in FRUS TEI, use a <gi>hi</gi>
                            element with a <att>rend</att> attribute value of <ident>strong</ident>.
