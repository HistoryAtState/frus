Foreign Relations of the United States
======================================

The *Foreign Relations of the United States* (FRUS) series presents the official documentary historical 
record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity.  The series is published
in print and online editions at the U.S. Department of State [Office of the Historian](http://history.state.gov/) 
website.  

In keeping with the spirit of the
[Digital Government Strategy's goals](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html)
to provide the public with access to high-quality digital government information and services 
and help unlock the power of government data to spur innovation, the Office of the Historian 
is releasing the source files for the online edition of the *Foreign Relations* series.  These source files 
are encoded in XML.  The text is identical to that found on the Office of the Historian website. 

The present release contains a representative set of volumes from the 1969-76 subseries â€” volumes I through X. 
The repository's location and organization should be considered experimental as we evaluate the feasibility
of GitHub as a platform for publishing this data.  Updates will be posted here.

Organization and Format
-----------------------
Each volume is a single file in the `volumes` directory.  These files have been prepared according to 
the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/) (TEI) P5 Guidelines.  In the `schema` directory we have 
supplied the TEI [ODD](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml) that documents our encoding 
guidelines and validating conformance thereto, as well as schematron file used for additional conformance checks.
