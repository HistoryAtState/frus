                            <p>1295. Secretary of Treasury requests that you confer immediately with
                                Minister of Finance and ascertain if financial aid or credit is
                                desired by the Russian Government, and if so, probable amount and
                                over what period of time it should be available, and as to what is
                                the most effective way in which such aid or credit can be extended.
                                You may discuss tentatively the idea that the United States
                                Government might extend such credit by purchasing for the United
                                States Treasury obligations of the Russian Government bearing the
                                same rate of interest that the Government of the United States would
                                have to pay for the money with which to purchase the obligations of
                                the Russian Government. Ascertain, also, whether or not any credit
                                extended by the United States in the circumstances would be used for
                                the purchase of supplies in the United States, and what amount of
                                credit would likely be required over a period of six months. The
                                fullest expression of views of the Russian Government on the whole
                                question of financial aid or credit by the United States Government
                                is desired. Secretary of Treasury requests reply as soon as
                                possible.</p>

                            <p>1161. Your 1295. For Secretary of Treasury:</p>
                            <p>Had two conferences with Minister of Finance who says loan would be
                                highly appreciated by Council of Ministers and all Russia. Russia
                                would expend entire proceeds in the United States by direct
                                purchases and not through British intervention as heretofore.
                                Estimates requirements at $500,000,000 provided tonnage therefor can
                                be secured. Is understood, he states, loan of $500,000,000 each
                                being made by us to England and France or $1,000,000,000 jointly,
                                and says would be injurious to new government and humiliating to
                                Russia if she were not granted the same terms. After deliberation
                                and conferences with colleagues he suggests that Russia issue 5 per
                                cent bond in dollars to the extent of $500,000,000 and that our
                                Government advance 95 to 97 per cent thereon as required to pay for
                                purchases, such advances, bearing 97 [5?] per cent, to be repaid by
                                Russia one year after peace treaty is signed if not sooner
                                liquidated by sale of bonds.</p>
                            <p>Russia will announce new 5 per cent loan, called liberty loan, in a
                                few days amount of which is unlimited and underwritten to the extent
                                of $3,000,000,000 by Russian bankers who will offer to public at 85
                                charging no commissions. Such bonds mature in 49 years but
                                reductions of loan will begin by drawings in 1922 and it is expected
                                entire loan will be liquidated in 21 years. Russia’s total debt is
                                Rs. 28,788,000,000. Annual interest Rs. 1,474,000,000. Circulation
                                Rs. 10,777,000,000 outstanding against which has gold reserve of Rs.
                                3,602,000,000 of which Rs. 2,141,000,000 is on special deposit in
                                England, the remainder in Petrograd. Some outstanding bond issues of
                                1905, 1906, and 1909 specify gold value of rubles in which principal
                                and interest are payable and such bonds are selling much higher than
                                other loans not containing such specifications, Witte in 1897
                                reduced the gold in the ruble which depreciated its value in our
                                money from almost 75 cents to 51½ cents consequently there is some
                                fear that similar action may be taken by this Government or its
                                successor. The Minister of Finance however says there is no
                                possibility thereof. This arrangement would not be affected by any
                                decline in value of ruble from any cause whatever as the bonds and
                                interest thereon would be payable in American dollars in
                                America.</p>
                            <p>Russia owns boundless forests, immeasurable deposits of ores and
                                oils, and immense areas of tillable lands. This loan in my judgment
                                    <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0053"/>would be absolutely safe.
                                Furthermore it is advisable from every viewpoint of policy.</p>

                            <p>1313. From Secretary of Treasury:</p>
                            <p>Replying to your cable April 6 please advise Minister Finance that
                                Congress will probably pass a bill shortly authorizing the Secretary
                                Treasury, with approval of President, to extend direct loans to
                                those foreign governments which can make use of financial aid most
                                effectively in fighting the common enemy. There is the friendliest
                                disposition towards Russia whose Government we are most anxious to
                                support and assist in every practicable and effective way. We shall
                                have to consider the situation of each government and the use it can
                                make of financial aid in order to determine where such aid can be
                                most wisely and powerfully employed. Please secure as much
                                information as possible about the determination and ability of the
                                Russian Government to carry on the war, if financial aid is
                                forthcoming, and cable the fullest possible information. Inform
                                Minister Finance that whatever financial aid is extended will be
                                extended by Treasury of the United States direct to the borrowing
                                government. Loans will be made at the same interest rate the
                                Government of the United States has to pay on its own bonds. The
                                rate of interest will probably not exceed 3½ or 4 per cent. Russian
                                obligations would be taken if the loan is made at par, without any
                                discount whatever, and at the rate of interest indicated. The
                                general terms and conditions of the loans will be determined by the
                                Secretary of Treasury with approval of the President. The
                                obligations of the foreign government, to which the loan is made,
                                will be purchased for the Treasury of the United States, and the

                            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs is much pleased prospect of securing
                                American loan. Learned following from him: Russia’s indebtedness <pb

                                furnished previous to 1917 Rs. 5,000,000,000. Estimated requirements

                                8,000,000 tons but reduced by Lords Milner and Revelstoke and
                                associates to 4,200,000 tons, estimated cost thereof Rs.
                                2,200,000,000. In addition thereto England agreed to furnish Russia
                                $360,000,000 to pay for purchases in America during 1917, such
                                purchases to be made by Russian commission in America but approved
                                by England. France soon after war began extended credit to Russia of
                                Fr. 125,000,000 monthly but that limit never consumed so that
                                Russia’s present indebtedness to France on open account for war
                                supplies is less than Fr. 1,000,000,000. English indebtedness bears
                                6 per cent, French 5 per cent, and both are due two years after war
                                ends. England and France have both promised to aid Russia in placing
                                bonds to meet this indebtedness.</p>
                            <p>Plan proposed in my No. 1161 of the 6th was that advances made by us
                                should be repaid one year after treaty of peace signed, which
                                Minister of Finance thinks would probably be two years after war
                                ends.</p>
                            <p>Minister of Finance appreciates low interest you suggest but desires
                                as long time as we can grant saying would pay advanced rate
                                therefor. Repeats that proceeds of loan be expended in our country.
                                Estimates railroad requirements $220,000,000 for locomotives, cars,
                                rails, and appurtenances, which Russia needs badly.</p>
                            <p>Says remainder of loan be used for agricultural products and
                                implements and for promoting industrial enterprises in Russia and
                                strengthening country’s gold reserve in event of early termination
                                of war.</p>
                            <p>Told him no aid whatever would be extended if separate peace
                                concluded of which he said that “there is no possibility.” Minister
                                desires to hold England to furnishing $360,000,000 mentioned above
                                in addition to what we advance Russia. When details of loan arranged
                                we should suggest safeguards concerning expenditure. More

                            <p>Minister of Finance states total annual interest Rs. 1,400,000,000;
                                total funded debt Rs. 37,000,000,000, of which Rs. 1,000,000,000

                                1,000,000,000 in 1925, and Rs. 2,000,000,000 in 1926; remainder are
                                49-year bonds maturing in 1963. Says state holdings of lands and
                                forests and deposits of coal, petroleum, platinum, and gold
                                aggregate much more [than] total indebtedness. Pokrovski, late
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs and former Comptroller of the Empire,
                                is now employed by Government in appraising Russia’s assets. Shall
                                cable report when finished. My judgment is that Russia can
                                undoubtedly meet all obligations. What Minister of Finance most
                                desires is long time, and would pay 4½ per cent or even 5 per cent
                                therefor. Says confidentially would like to transfer from England to
                                us the $360,000,000 mentioned in my No. 1204, but without taking

                            <p>1359. From Secretary of Treasury:</p>
                            <p>Cable received. Am considering carefully credit needs Russia along
                                with other governments. Hope to reach conclusion shortly <pb n="6"
                                    xml:id="pg_6" facs="0056"/>and will advise you fully.
                                Contemplated orders for freight cars and locomotives should not be
                                considered without consultation with Treasury Department. This most
                                important if purchases are to be made on reasonable basis and proper
                                deliveries secured. Contemplated financial arrangements under act of
                                Congress will necessitate formation of commission under direction of
                                the Treasury through which all purchases of supplies in United
                                States for Allied Governments may proceed with assurance of proper
                                coordination and best results. Great Britain, France, and Italy have
                                accepted this principle and loans to them will be made on this
                                basis. Understand that Russia also accepts this principle. Details
                                being worked out. Full advices will be sent you at earliest possible
                                moment. Meanwhile somebody in Washington should be given plenary
                                power to act for and sign necessary obligations and agreements for
                                Russian Government as well as power to draw checks against deposits
                                of the funds which may be loaned by Treasury Department. Otherwise
                                unnecessary delays will result.</p>

                                $100,000,000; to Italy for $50,000,000; and to Russia for probably
                                $100,000,000. They are very fearful of our granting credit to
                                England for Russia or to Russia through England and say such policy
                                would be grievous mistake and would hurt Russian pride irreparably,
                                in which I fully concur. New liberty loan very popular. Minister of
                                Finance addressed Moscow Bourse Friday when resolution was
                                unanimously adopted pledging every interest represented to subscribe
                                to extent of 25 per cent of its capital. Subscription was Rs.
                                700,000,000. Object of this call was to caution us against extending
                                credit to Russia through England whose patronizing attitude is
                                bitterly resented by people and Ministry. Russian commission will
                                leave within ten days. Can we send cruiser to Bergen or Liverpool to
                                meet it? Such suggestion made by Ministers calling and strikes me

                            <p>1239. For Secretary of the Treasury:</p>
                            <p>Answering Department’s 1359, April 28, 2 p.m. If I understand your
                                message you propose forming commission for giving orders there for
                                all [supplies?]. Such arrangement seems wise and is ac-ceptable to
                                the Minister of Finance, Minister of Ways of Communication, Minister
                                of Trade and Industry, with whom had joint conference to-day. They
                                would greatly appreciate, however, our prompt contracting for 10,000
                                freight cars and 500 locomotives and our arranging for delivery
                                thereof at Vladivostok, this being start on 40,000 freight cars and
                                2,000 locomotives. Their rolling stock requirements are urgent.
                                Whenever such contracts consummated, Russian Chargé d’Affaires will
                                be authorized to execute whatever form of obligation you prescribe
                                and to draw checks against deposits. They still object to any
                                intermediary between ourselves and Russian Government. Holbrook,
                                representing International Corporation, here endeavoring to secure
                                commission for purchase of railroad equipment and so informs me. Of
                                course I am recommending no specific American firm but relying upon
                                you for Russia’s necessities being promptly and fairly met.</p>

                            <p>1386. Your 1239, May 1, 8 p.m. Secretary of the Treasury replies to
                                your telegram May 1 as follows:</p>
                            <p>The act of Congress authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to lend
                                money to foreign governments making war on Germany on such terms and
                                conditions as he thinks necessary or desirable, but he must take
                                back an obligation from the foreign government to <pb n="8"
                                    xml:id="pg_8" facs="0058"/>which the loan is made, bearing 3½
                                per cent interest and having a maturity to be agreed upon. In order
                                to negotiate such a loan it is necessary for some representative of
                                the Russian Government in the United States to be empowered by the
                                Russian Government to sign the necessary agreement or agreements
                                containing the terms and conditions under which the loan is made,
                                and also to execute the note or obligation of the Russian Government
                                to the United States. After the loan is thus made, the
                                representative of the Russian Government in the United States should
                                have power to open an account with the Treasurer of the United
                                States, or with banks in the United States designated by the
                                Secretary of the Treasury, and to draw checks against such account
                                in order that payments may be made from time to time for supplies
                                purchased in the United States.</p>
                            <p>The loan transaction will be a direct one between the United States
                                Government and the Russian Government, but no progress can be made
                                until the Russian Government fully empowers its representative in
                                the United States to act for and bind it. Will such power be
                                conferred and upon whom? The loan so made by the United States
                                Government will contain a provision that no supplies are to be
                                purchased in the United States without the approval of a
                                representative of the Treasury Department. This will insure the
                                purchase of supplies in the United States upon the most reasonable
                                terms and will facilitate prompt deliveries. This is as much to the
                                interest of the Russian Government as to the American Government,
                                because there is not an unlimited supply of credit in the United
                                States and the demands of all the Allied Governments are great. Our
                                credit resources must, therefore, be used to the best advantage.
                                After the loan is made the Russian representative in the United
                                States designated by the Russian Government to make purchases can
                                negotiate immediately through the Treasury Department for the
                                purchase of railroad cars and locomotives as desired by the Russian
                                Government, and everything will be done by this Government to
                                facilitate such purchases and deliveries. Please make this clear and
                                cable reply quickly as possible.</p>

                            <p>1415. The Secretary of the Treasury desires you to communicate the
                                following to the Minister of Finance: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The Secretary of the Treasury salutes the Minister of Finance
                                        of Russia and begs to inform him that he has, with great
                                        pleasure, established to-day a credit in behalf of the
                                        Russian Government or $100,000,000. This credit is to bear
                                        interest at 3 per cent per annum until converted as
                                        hereinafter stated. Interest will begin to run from the date
                                        of the respective drafts drawn by the Russian Government
                                        against this credit. The same arrangement has been made with
                                        regard to this credit as with the credits established by the
                                        United States Government in favor of Great Britain, France,
                                        and Italy; namely, that the supplies purchased in the United
                                        States with the proceeds of such credits shall be made
                                        through a commissioner, or a commission of the Treasury
                                        Department, whose duty it will be to make such purchases in
                                        behalf of and on the requisitions and specifications <pb
                                            n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0060"/>of the borrowing
                                        government, securing the most favorable possible prices and
                                        deliveries. The execution of the orders and the inspection
                                        of the supplies will be carried out under the supervision
                                        and direction of the duly constituted representatives of the
                                        Russian Government in the United States. We are proceeding
                                        immediately with the negotiations for the 500 locomotives
                                        and 10,000 freight cars referred to in your previous cables,
                                        keeping at the same time in close touch and cooperation with
                                        the representatives of the Russian Government in the United
                                        States. The payments for these locomotives and cars will be
                                        made out of the $100,000,000 credit established as herein
                                        stated.</p>
                                    <p>I should state that if at any time before June 30 any sum is
                                        drawn against the present credit to meet payments for
                                        supplies purchased the amount will be represented by a
                                        short-time certificate of indebtedness maturing on that
                                        date, bearing not more than 3½ per cent interest, but it
                                        will then be refunded into a longer-time obligation, the
                                        rate of interest being always the same rate as that which
                                        the United States must pay upon its own obligations issued
                                        to provide such credit. Under the act of April 24, 1917, it
                                        is provided that if the United States is obliged to borrow
                                        money at a higher rate than 3½ per cent during the
                                        continuance of the war with Germany, then the obligations of
                                        the foreign governments taken by the United States shall be
                                        converted by the borrowing governments into new obligations
                                        bearing the higher rate of interest paid by the Government
                                        of the United States. The object of the law is to give the
                                        foreign governments making common cause with the United
                                        States against Germany the benefit of the credit of the
                                        United States at all times at exactly the same rate that the
                                        United States itself has to pay. All credits made under
                                        authority of the act of Congress approved April 24, 1917,
                                        have in view, as shown by the title and specific text of
                                        that act, the prosecution of the existing war. The purposes
                                        of the loans made under the authority of this act are
                                        correspondingly limited. In case of the discontinuance of
                                        war the credits will of course cease to be extended. The
                                        commission headed by former Secretary of State <persName
                                            corresp="#p_RE2">Root</persName> will, upon its arrival
                                        in Petrograd, enter very fully into a discussion with the
                                        Russian Government of its financial needs to carry on the
                                        war, and every effort will be made by the Government of the
                                        United States to extend, within the limits authorized from

                                        to establish liberty throughout the world and particularly
                                        to assist the Russian people in securing the blessings of

                            <p>15. Critical situation exists here requiring payment of naval and
                                part of military force of Warsaw [Finland] for which Russian paper
                                money can not be used. This affects most powerful part of Baltic
                                Fleet and unless met promptly will seriously endanger existing
                                government and whole line of Russian offense and defense. Under
                                these pressing conditions we recommend that for the purpose of
                                insuring the prosecution of the war a further credit of $75,000,000
                                be made available immediately for Russia without any limitation as
                                to where money will be used. Minister for Foreign Affairs assures us
                                this amount will suffice for this important purpose until next
                                November. It is now apparent that the deficiency in tonnage will
                                greatly reduce the quantity of munitions for which credits to Russia
                                will be required. Answer should be received by <persName

                                not accept rubles. This $75,000,000 is separate credit for specific
                                purpose and will be used solely for the purpose mentioned and
                                consumed in such amounts and at such times as requirements
                                determine. If Russian soldiers or sailors should be withdrawn from
                                Finland and Finnish waters or for any reason Finnish marks should
                                not be required to pay Russian soldiers and sailors this $75,000,000
                                credit will not be consumed, but under no circumstances is it to be
                                increased without additional agreement. Thinking Finland might have
                                designs use this credit for purchases in the United States, I have
                                definitely informed Russian Government that the extension of this
                                credit carries no obligation on our part to permit any kind of
                                exports to Finland or elsewhere. Minister of Foreign Affairs at
                                front returning 14th. Above agreement however quite definite. It is
                                possible Finland may require some or all of credit transferred by
                                Russia (to be kept?) in London to which I suppose you do not object.
                                Russian-Finnish relations strained. Please answer by telegraph
                                immediately whether above agreement is clearly understood.</p>

                            <p>1568. Following from Secretary of Treasury:</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of the Treasury, in conformity with his declaration of
                                July 9 answering Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RE2">Root</persName>’s
                                recommendation of July 8, has to-day agreed with Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName> to place to
                                the credit of the Russian Ministry of Finance, specifically to the
                                account “Compte section étrangère extraordinaire” in the National
                                City Bank, the sum of $75,000,000 in parts as the same may from time
                                to <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0063"/>time be called for by the
                                Russian Ambassador, beginning to-day with $10,000,000. Future
                                payments on this account are authorized by the Ambassador to be made
                                to Mr. <persName>W. Novitsky</persName> for deposit to the same
                                account. It has been assumed that the Ambassador has the right to
                                sign obligations of his Government for the sums loaned; to receive
                                the moneys covered by such obligations; to deposit them in
                                depositaries chosen by him; and to designate to the Secretary of the
                                Treasury others than himself to whom Treasury warrants may be drawn
                                and upon whose order deposits may be made of the sums involved. The
                                Secretary of the Treasury respectfully requests to be informed as to
                                whether this assumption is entirely correct and that the Russian
                                Government approves and adopts all that has been done under this
                                procedure by its Ambassador.</p>

                            <p>Foreign Office in note of July 14 received 16th in Russian,
                                translated to-day, states Minister of Finance has just been informed
                                by his agent in England “of the categorical refusal of the British
                                Government to continue payment on Russian orders in the United
                                States in view of the fact that the British Government itself
                                disposes of no other credits in dollars save those which opened for
                                payments of English orders.” Russian Government consequently asks:
                                “A further credit of $25,000,000 destined to cover most urgent
                                payments on orders formerly placed in United States as against
                                English credits.”</p>
                            <p>The note refers to another credit of $25,000,000, of which I am not

                                from the representations made that it was vital to Russia’s national
                                security and a successful conduct of the war.</p>

                                do recommend however that we immediately increase the $100,000,000
                                credit to $150,000,000 that Russia may have no excuse for not
                                prosecuting war. Understood that some purchases are lying on
                                Atlantic docks awaiting payments before shipment. How do you feel
                                concerning assuming obligations of England for Russian purchases in
                                America? Orderly quiet prevails Petrograd.</p>

                            <p>1595. Following from Secretary of Treasury:</p>
                            <p>No credits have yet been granted to the Russian Government except the
                                $100,000,000 and the $75,000,000 mentioned in previous telegrams.
                                Former sum allocated as follows: Approximately $46,000,000 for
                                10,000 cars and 500 locomotives, this sum not payable <pb n="18"
                                    xml:id="pg_18" facs="0068"/>for some time. Thirty-five million
                                dollars in cash has been turned over to <persName corresp="#p_BBA1"
                                    >Bakhmeteff</persName> for payment of various accounts due in
                                the United States, including interest on loans in this country and
                                part payments on agricultural and railway machinery, all these
                                exclusive of contracts placed on British credit. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName> desires remaining sum to
                                be spent largely for silver bullion desired to be transformed into
                                coin for the payment of Russian troops in territory where paper
                                rubles will not be accepted; and for two million pairs of shoes
                                represented as urgently needed. No drafts thus far notified to us
                                against the special credit of $75,000,000 although $10,000,000 was
                                placed in National City Bank to meet any sudden call such as
                                indicated in <persName corresp="#p_RE2">Root</persName>’s

                            <p><persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName> on July 21
                                submitted request for total credit and cash to January 1, 1918, of
                                $733,000,000, this including $154,000,000 chiefly for additional
                                rolling stock, much of which would not be actually paid out until
                                sometime next year. In this request is included $110,000,000 balance
                                due on orders placed with British credit; $25,000,000 for Remington
                                contract for rifles; $15,000,000 for Westinghouse contract for
                                rifles; $38,000,000 for payments in Sweden; $23,000,000 for interest
                                on money borrowed and expected to be borrowed from the United States
                                Government; $8,000,000 for interest on other borrowings in this
                                country; $70,000,000 for support of ruble exchange; $150,000,000 for
                                various orders desired to be placed in the near future.</p>
                            <p>I have no thought of allowing the further credit except possibly to
                                meet August payments on orders placed on British credit and possibly
                                other urgent sums on contracts placed independently and requiring
                                payments in the month of August. Cash payments which Russia may
                                require and which I might consider favorably will probably not
                                exceed in that month $60,000,000, largely to relieve the British for
                                their responsibility for Russian orders. <persName corresp="#p_BBA1"
                                    >Bakhmeteff</persName> states delay in meeting his request may
                                produce misapprehension in Petrograd. Would like your immediate
                                advice as to whether Russian Government desires British Government
                                to be relieved of these payments; whether political conditions in
                                Petrograd suggest desirability of favorable treatment of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName>’s request; also whether
                                Russian Government desires that any action I may be able to take
                                shall be determined wholly upon representations made by <persName

                                additional credit about coincides with your cable which states you
                                are favorably considering advancing $60,000,000 for August payments
                                mainly to meet British obligations for Russian orders. See no
                                objection thereto if such purchases are necessary war supplies
                                awaiting shipment. Before our entering war England assumed
                                obligation for $200,000,000 Russian war supplies to be purchased in
                                America. When Russia first asked American credit, Minister of
                                Finance definitely and repeatedly expressed desire that English
                                obligation for Russian purchases in America should not be included
                                therein. Now Russia asks English relief from such obligations.
                                Government here so admits. From commercial viewpoint England should
                                guarantee such obligations but would be impolitic to so require.
                                Russia clearly understands from me that our relieving England from
                                obligations comes out of Russian credit. Minister of Finance not

                            <p>The policy adopted by His Majesty’s Government in the past regarding
                                Allied financial requirements is well exemplified by the case of
                                Russia. The latter’s demand for $700,000,000 is, for reasons
                                explained below, quite unreasonable. If, however, she were to
                                present such a demand to an inter-Allied council sitting in London
                                it would be impossible for the other Allies to criticise it as
                                unreasonable, seeing that they would be all putting forward demands
                                of their own. The following observations might even be taken
                                exception to by the Russian representatives were it a question of
                                the council forwarding them officially.</p>
                            <p>The situation at Vladivostok. According to the latest figures
                                available the accumulations there amount to 662,000 tons. It will
                                take all this year and the greater part of next to move this
                                quantity into the interior of Russia. Accordingly it has been
                                decided to suspend the shipment of goods to Vladivostok. Exceptions
                                are however made in favour of rolling stock which can help in
                                clearing the port, a certain amount of material required to complete
                                the goods already shipped to Vladivostok or material convenient for
                                packing such rolling stock.</p>
                            <p>The situation in the White Sea up to the close of navigation. From
                                France 291,957 tons will be shipped and 188,043 tons left
                                behind.</p>
                            <p>From the United Kingdom there will be shipped 374,104 tons and left
                                behind 75,800.</p>
                            <p>From the United States 237,276 tons will be shipped and left behind
                                447,359.</p>
                            <p>It is still quite problematical how much the Murman route will be
                                able to carry during the winter. But in any case, in relation to the
                                above tables, the amount cannot be very important.</p>
                            <p>The goods which Russia has thus ordered already exceed more than can
                                be shipped by June of next year. Particularly is this the case as
                                far as regards America where at the end of the season enormous
                                masses of material will still remain unshipped.</p>
                            <p>From the above it follows that it will be useless, for many months to
                                come, to place any more substantial orders for Russia, except in the
                                case of certain classes of goods which may be exceptionally urgent
                                and at the same time of small volume.</p>
                            <p>The value of orders already placed by the British Government on
                                behalf of the Russian Government (and a certain number which the
                                Russian Government has placed independently at various dates but
                                which are believed not to be very large) may be taken as a measure
                                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0071"/>of Russian financial
                                requirements. Say $10,000,000 a month for exchange would also be a
                                reasonable request for the Russian Government to put forward. Thus a
                                total sum of $350,000,000 to $400,000,000 up to the end of the year
                                would be fully sufficient: this amount would include arrears due to
                                the British Government for American disbursements on behalf of the
                                Russian Government since April 1 last.</p>
                            <p>The above figures clearly show the narrow limits within which
                                shipment is possible although of course orders might be placed to an
                                unlimited extent.</p>

                                transportation facilities permit, some portion for supplemental
                                orders to be placed and for current expenses of Russian Ministry of
                                Finance; a portion for transportation charges; and $5,000,000 for
                                emergency expenditures in Scandinavian countries.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of the Treasury gives assurance concerning railway
                                material that from future credits a sufficient sum will be allocated
                                to cover the purchase of 30,000 additional cars and 1,500 additional
                                locomotives and Vladivostok shops. The actual placing of these
                                orders for this railway material is deferred until an appropriate
                                time, probably not later than November 1, when it is hoped that
                                prices lower than existing ones can be secured.</p>
                            <p>Concerning British credits, negotiations are pending which may be
                                concluded in the next few days. Other portions of the program
                                originally submitted calling for $733,000,000 will be given further
                                consideration as soon as possible. Future congressional authority
                                will be asked for and must be obtained before any larger program can
                                be finally determined upon, but the Secretary of the Treasury will
                                take into the most careful and sympathetic consideration all
                                requirements presented to him, bearing in mind the financial
                                limitations of the United States Treasury as well as limitations of
                                transportation by land and sea. It is of course understood that
                                these credits are available only during the time Russia is engaged
                                in war <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0073"/>against Germany.

                            <p>1761. From Secretary of the Treasury:</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of the Treasury has received an application from
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName> for the
                                establishment of additional credits in favor of the Russian
                                Government to meet their requirements until January 1, 1918, in a
                                sum aggregating $235,000,000, made up of the following items:
                                Current expenses of the Ministry of Finance, $45,000,000; orders
                                placed by the Russian Supply Committee in New York, $10,000,000;
                                payments on credit operations, $2,000,000; provision for
                                transportation, $5,000,000; payments in Sweden, $33,000,000; new
                                orders to be placed through the recently established Purchasing
                                Commission here, $140,000,000. Of the total of $235,000,000, the
                                Ambassador estimates that the cash requirements up to January 1,
                                1918, will be approximately $140,000,000, made up of the full sums
                                indicated under each of the above items, except that of the
                                $140,-000,000 for orders to be placed through the Purchasing
                                Commission, but $45,000,000 of which will be needed in cash by that
                                date. In addition the Ambassador estimates that cash withdrawals
                                under the credits already standing in favor of the Russian
                                Government up to January 1, 1918, will be approximately $41,000,000,
                                making a total of estimated cash withdrawals to that date of
                                $181,000,000.</p>
                            <p>Before acting on the application for the establishment of the
                                additional credits referred to, the Secretary of the Treasury would
                                be pleased to have your advice on the subject.</p>
                            <p>Enormous pressure on Treasury from all sides renders wholly
                                impossible full compliance with all Allied requests. All are now
                                asked to observe utmost moderation in presenting requests.</p>

                                investigation as to the risks run in transmitting balance of the
                                special $75,000,000 credit to Russian account for disbursement in
                                Finland. If there is pronounced weakness in control of Finnish
                                situation by Russian Government, might not the disposition of funds
                                in Finland either be put to no good use at all or possibly against
                                our interests? As heretofore advised, no withdrawals will be
                                permitted from this fund until receipt of special advice from you,
                                but in advance of sudden demands that may be made by Ambassador

                                which have given much thought and time conferring three hours last
                                evening with the Minister of Finance and assistant and had two
                                conferences with the Director of Credit Chancellery. Still think
                                Russia will pay all obligations in time but her continuing war is of
                                more importance to us as abandoning now would damage us so
                                enormously that it would require untold billions and many
                                generations to repair. Main question is whether what we lend Russia
                                now will be appropriated by Germany. We must take the risk thereof.
                                President of the Ministry (or Council of Ministers) in an interview
                                given Associated Press manifests impatience that British Fleet not
                                assisting Russia in Baltic and says Allies should help Russia who
                                bore brunt of war in beginning and has fought without aid while
                                England and America helping France. Consequently think should extend
                                additional $100,000,000 credit. Russia tired, peace sentiment
                                growing, and our failure to agree might give irresistible impetus
                                thereto. If Soviet should control, government would not survive long
                                but would be succeeded by stronger government which would be more
                                potential in restoring order and prosecuting war. …</p>

                                conference evening of 1st, nor could he give me amount paid to
                                England for such ordnance out of advances made by us. Director of

                                    <p>The promulgation of this decree was indispensable for various
                                        reasons. On these loans, contracted for the most part on
                                        account of the war, we should have been obliged to pay
                                        foreign capitalists annually Rs. 1,000,000,000 or about Rs.
                                        40 per family. Now there is no reason to pay such tribute to
                                        foreign capitalists. Russia has paid enough in blood and
                                        suffering on the fields of battle of this war of
                                        international capitalism, or in interest and amortization
                                        charges in the good old time. What remains the foreign
                                        capitalists may charge to profit and loss account, along
                                        with their enormous war profits.</p>
                                    <p>The foreign loans of Russia are placed for the most part in
                                        England, Germany, and France; therefore the present moment
                                        is extremely well chosen for their annulment. The
                                        capitalists of these countries are at this moment so
                                        enfeebled by the long war and the discontent of the
                                        workingmen growing out of it that they will not be in a
                                        condition to wage war on Russia for the sole purpose of
                                        recovering the amount of the annulled loans.</p>
                                    <p>If we had not annulled the foreign loans we should have been
                                        obliged to strip the village of its last egg and its last
                                        pound of butter to collect a billion rubles for interest
                                        payments. Only the annulment of the loans can ameliorate and
                                        equilibrate our balance of trade and augment the vitality,
                                        we even say the credit, of our national economy.</p>

                            <p>The opposition press has had so many protests to make against the
                                course of the Maximalists that it has grown tired. It has not taken
                                the trouble to point out the contradictions in the above references
                                to the enormous war profits and the extreme enfeeblement of
                                international capitalism, but has merely reprinted with approval the
                                indignant comment of the foreign press. Nor has it criticized <pb

                                Maximalist organ, which, moreover, is probably only for

                            <p>There is now talk of requiring the deposit in bank, subject to
                                restrictions of withdrawal, of all Russian paper currency, with the
                                proviso that notes not stamped shall be annulled. The majority of
                                the Russian currency notes is supposed to be held by the peasants,
                                who would not be troubled greatly by the restriction of weekly
                                withdrawals from bank to Rs. 150. The bank depositors have shown a
                                tendency to withdraw deposits, partly on account of restrictions
                                imposed, and partly because they fear a levy on accounts exceeding a
                                certain minimum. The requirement of the stamping and registration of
                                bonds and currency, to be followed, as is expected, by taxes or
                                partial confiscation of holdings exceeding the Socialist norm,
                                whatever that may be, would be effective means of <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>In voting for the resolution, Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself
                                were moved by consideration that being only a recommendation of the
                                general principle to our respective Governments we were not in any
                                way compromising their action and at the same time, according to

                            <p>2369. Bolshevik press sharply criticizes protest of entire Diplomatic

                                war on proletariat and calling on the workmen of world to unite in
                                opposition. Diplomatic Corps held a meeting 13th and unanimously,
                                excepting myself, agreed to another protest framed by Swiss Minister
                                against nationalization of land, etc., as far as affected our
                                nationals for whom it demanded without limitation free disposition
                                of bank credits, securities and cash of any value. I asked time to
                                consider saying (if?) approved would sign and send colleagues for
                                signature and present to Government, (if?) disapproved would call
                                another meeting. Conferred since with British and French
                                Ambassadors, who now concur that aforesaid general protest
                                sufficient and particularizing unadvisable, furthermore could tell
                                them but not neutrals that impolitic to irritate Soviet and drive it
                                into German alliance. Called meeting Diplomatic Corps for the 16th.
                                Germans now endeavoring to effect commercial treaty with Russia
                                which am trying cheek by promising agricultural implements, shoes,
                                etc., in exchange for products which enemy would otherwise secure.

                                consuls to pursue general lines of protest of my 2360, February 12,
                                treating each individual case on its merits but not to encourage

                                interfere with personal liberty of nationals or confiscate property
                                owned before same were promulgated or enacted; consuls directed to
                                attend opening of safe-deposit boxes and categorically protest
                                against opening, also protest against extraction of property or

                                from commissariat. Such instructions solely for guidance of consuls
                                who prohibited from divulging same. These instructions not formally
                                adopted but seemed to meet general approval, consequently no

                                    Washington.</note> informs me that, substantially, all Russian
                                purchases made here prior to our entry into the war with funds
                                advanced by the British Government were made through J. P. Morgan
                                &amp; Co., and that practically all of the other direct purchases
                                were made with funds obtained through loans placed with American
                                banks. Russia placed in this country $11,000,000 in 5 per cent
                                one-year notes, which have been renewed twice and which mature May
                                1; also, $25,000,000 of Russian 5½ per cent bonds were sold to a
                                syndicate of bankers; and $50,000,000 was obtained through a
                                syndicate of banks, headed by the National City Bank, and 6½ per
                                cent certificates were issued against the unused ruble balance. In
                                addition, some interior Russian bonds were sold here.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1">Ughet</persName> further states that
                                the rails and approximately 9,000 tons of barbed wire, which are
                                stored by Russia in this country, were purchased some time prior to
                                our entry into the war and paid for in most part from the proceeds
                                of loans obtained through American banks. One contract for 35,000
                                tons of barbed wire, which is now being delivered, was placed
                                through Morgan’s on behalf of the British Government, and the
                                British Government has already disposed of approximately 10,000 tons
                                of this barbed wire to our War Department, and is applying the
                                proceeds in reduction of Russian obligations held by Great
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1">Ughet</persName> also informs me that
                                the British Government, with the consent of the Anglo-Russian
                                subcommittee, is disposing of all of the materials which were
                                purchased through Morgan’s with British funds and applying the
                                proceeds in reduction of Russian obligations held by Great Britain.
                                It would seem, therefore, that the British Government is looking
                                after its interests very well in this respect, and that they could
                                have no claim whatever in respect to the rails and Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_US1">Ughet</persName> understands that the British
                                lay no claim whatever to any interest in the rails.</p>
                            <p>The above-mentioned 9,000 tons of barbed wire are being sold to the
                                Italian Government and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1"
                                    >Ughet</persName> is of the opinion that the proceeds from this
                                sale should be applied in providing interest for an additional year
                                on the $11,000,000 note issue maturing May 1, and that any other
                                surplus funds obtained from the sale of materials purchased and paid
                                for from the proceeds of the above-mentioned American loans should
                                be used, as far as practicable, to [for] paying the interest on the
                                other above-mentioned credits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1"
                                    >Ughet</persName>’s personal opinion is that there are
                                sufficient funds on hand to meet the actual current obligations for
                                contracts, with the exception of the Remington rifle contract.</p>
                            <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0088"/>
                            <p>It now appears that the Russian Ambassador has ample funds in the
                                National City Bank to meet the balance due on all contracts here
                                (with the exception of the Remington rifles to be delivered in July
                                and October) for purchases, freight, expenses, and interest to May 1
                                on all Russian loans placed through American banks.</p>
                            <p>It should be determined, therefore, what application should be made
                                of the surplus funds derived from the sale of the rails and other
                                materials purchased with funds advanced to Russia by American banks
                                and by the United States Government, and whether or not entire
                                preference should be given to the Remington rifle contract, or to
                                the payment of interest on the Russian credits and obligations
                                placed through American banks and the obligations held by this
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Referring to our conversation on the above subject, my understanding
                                is that you are of the opinion that such surplus funds, if any,
                                should be applied by the Russian Ambassador to payment of interest
                                on Russian credits and obligations up to and including July 1, and
                                to any other current obligations as they become due, rather than
                                setting aside a specific amount for payment in July and October on
                                the Remington rifle contracts.</p>
                            <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                                        >Polk</persName></hi>: At the time when during November
                                last, funds belonging to the Russian Government were distributed for
                                payments on different liabilities, it was considered proper to
                                appropriate means for payment of interest on different credit
                                operations of the Russian Government with private banking
                                institutions approximately until June 1, 1918.</p>
                            <p>It appears at present necessary to foresee later payments. An
                                attached statement<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">Not printed.</note>
                                specifies in detail payments of interest and other <pb n="40"
                                    xml:id="pg_40" facs="0090"/>current liabilities in between June
                                1, 1918 and January 1, 1919, the payments during such period
                                totaling $3,276,718.76. Including payments due early in January
                                1919, the total is brought to $5,276,718.76.</p>
                            <p>As funds, at present at my disposal, are not in any way adequate to
                                meet payments of such magnitude it is necessary to provide for other
                                sources. In regard to this I wish to bring to your attention the
                                account of the “Section étrangère ministère des finances” with the
                                Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. This account, amounting at present
                                to nearly five million dollars, was established in July 1916 and has
                                been upheld since by deposits from proceeds of different credit
                                operations of the Russian Government in this country. The account
                                has been in direct charge of the “Foreign Department of the Russian
                                Ministry of Finance,” disbursements being effected on orders coming
                                directly from Petrograd.</p>
                            <p>I have been given to understand that the Guaranty Trust Co. would be
                                willing to release the funds on this account provided the company
                                were to receive certain assurances from the Department of State,
                                protecting such action of the company from interference by a future
                                lawful government of Russia.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the above, I venture to recall that the “Section
                                ètrangère ministere des finances” is the foreign operative
                                department of the Chancery of Credit, which is in direct charge of
                                questions pertaining to credit operations in foreign countries. It
                                has been the special duty of this department to attend to payments
                                of interest on foreign loans and to execute such payments. Under
                                normal conditions there could be no doubt as to the absolute
                                necessity of meeting payments of interest on time and in particular
                                to the use, for such purpose, of funds on the accounts of the
                                “Foreign Department.”</p>
                            <p>Referring to the present case it is hardly possible to perceive how
                                any future government, recognized as lawful, could controvert the
                                obvious legality of paying interest on direct and undisputable
                                liabilities of its lawful predecessor to private citizens or
                                corporations of a friendly country. The very fact of the recognition
                                of the government as lawful seems necessarily to imply the
                                consideration by such government of the validity of similar
                                obligations.</p>
                            <p>It seems, therefore, inconceivable that the use of funds deposited to
                                the accounts of the Foreign Department of the Ministry of Finance of
                                Russia for the former Russian Government for payment of interest on
                                loans raised by the same government could raise objections from any
                                future recognized government of Russia. For this reason it is highly
                                improbable that complications of any character <pb n="41"
                                    xml:id="pg_41" facs="0091"/>could arise from the fact of the
                                United States Government giving the necessary assurance to the
                                Guaranty Trust Co.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, in case the Guaranty Trust Co.’s funds were
                                released, I would undertake to have the whole amount assigned to the
                                special purpose of meeting current payments on financial liabilities
                                resulting from credit operations of the Russian Government in this
                                country, removing through such assignment any possible doubts which
                                may arise as to the justification of disposing the funds for general
                                purposes.</p>
                            <p>Hoping that, after giving these questions consideration, you will
                                find it possible to have the funds released and thus have assured
                                the proper payment of interest to the holders of Russian securities
                                in this country, I remain [etc.]</p>

                                of the government have been given the right to circulate as currency

                                shares who have registered them correctly and in due time.</p>

                                relation to the registration of interest-bearing papers are defined
                                by the People’s Commissary of Finance and published for general
                                information.</p>
                            <p>8. All shares in respect to which a statement as per foregoing
                                article has not been made in due time, will be considered without
                                compensation as property of the state.</p>
                            <p>Note: Owners and holders of shares who have failed to fulfil the
                                stipulations of the present decree are liable to imprisonment for

                                securities are also liable to registration.</p>
                            <p>10. Russian interest-bearing papers held abroad, whether private,
                                public, or government, are likewise registered, irrespective of
                                their belonging to Russian or foreign citizens. At registration it
                                is necessary to produce the actual papers to persons or institutions
                                which are appointed by the representatives of Russia abroad to keep
                                the government registration books. The date of registration will be
                                fixed by Russian diplomatic representatives abroad.</p>

                            <p>164. Russian one-year notes to amount of $11,000,000, placed through
                                National City Bank three years ago and which have been renewed
                                twice, mature May 1. Russian Ambassador has funds available for
                                paying interest for six months or one year in case notes are
                                extended, but can not, of course, pay principal. It is very
                                desirable that these notes be extended without protest or attempt on
                                part of note holders to attach any Russian property here which would
                                create a crisis and might force this Government to take over all
                                Russian assets and apply proceeds to credit of Russian obligations.
                                It seems advisable from note-holders’ standpoint to grant extension
                                and not create a situation whereby this Government would be
                                compelled to take an antagonistic position to protect its own
                                interests, leaving little or nothing for note holders. Notes are
                                held by National City Bank and few other large interests, all or
                                substantially all assenting to extension, with exception of
                                $2,500,000, which were purchased by the Russian Corporation in
                                England, of which Holden is president, through proceeds loan from
                                City Bank. City Bank has asked consent of Russian Corporation to
                                grant extension but has demanded payment of its loan or additional
                                collateral. Russian Corporation replied that it could give no
                                additional security, but has indicated its willingness to extend
                                notes, provided City Bank would extend loan without additional
                                security. Am advised that Russian Corporation has other assets and
                                as City Bank has been cooperating satisfactorily in this and other
                                Russian matters, have agreed to use good offices to get additional
                                security, if available, from Russian Corporation. This, of course,
                                is a delicate matter, but British representative suggests
                                advisability of our suggesting that you take matter up unofficially
                                with British Treasury, explaining that apparently nothing would be
                                gained by refusing to extend notes and that City Bank is entitled to
                                additional security.</p>

                                <p>The British Government have up to March 31 provided funds to meet
                                    coupons payable in London on the direct state debt of Russia and
                                    on securities having the state guarantee of that country. They
                                    have taken this course hitherto, though under no obligation to
                                    do so, but in view of the present conditions in Russia they can
                                    no longer continue this course.</p>
                                <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer gives notice, therefore, that, as
                                    from April 1, 1918, holders of the securities above specified
                                    must no longer look to the British Treasury for the provision of
                                    funds to meet interest due to them from Russia. At the same time
                                    he publishes the following declaration which has been agreed
                                    upon between the British and French Governments, and which will
                                    be published on behalf of the French Government in Paris.</p>
                                <p>“The Imperial Russian Government, at the time when it entered
                                    into obligations, was without doubt the representative of Russia
                                    and definitely pledged that country and this undertaking cannot
                                    be repudiated by the authorities whatever they may be, which
                                    hold or may hold power in Russia, without the very foundations
                                    of international law being shaken. Otherwise there would no
                                    longer be any security in the relations between states, and it
                                    would become <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0096"/>impossible
                                    to enter into any obligation for a long period if this
                                    obligation could be questioned.</p>
                                <p>This would entail the ruin of the credit of states politically as
                                    well as financially. A country would no longer be able to borrow
                                    on normal conditions if lenders should find that their sole
                                    guarantee lay in the maintenance of the constitution in virtue
                                    of which the borrowing government, as the representative of its
                                    country, made its request for credit. No principle is better
                                    established than that by which a nation is responsible for the
                                    acts of its government, and no change in the government can
                                    affect the obligations previously incurred.</p>
                                <p>The obligations of Russia continue; they are, and will continue
                                    to be, binding upon the new state or group of states by which
                                    Russia is or will be represented.”</p>

                            <p>175. Your 164. Holden not president of Russian Corporation but his
                                son a director. Sir <persName>Robert Chalmers</persName> brought
                                about meeting with Tait and Stoddard, corporation’s two principal
                                officers, who give following statement of their position. Besides
                                indebtedness to City Bank, corporation’s only other debt about
                                £250,000 secured loans held by British banks which have been
                                renewing without receiving or asking additional security. Company’s
                                assets of about £1,800,000, book value, consist chiefly of Russian
                                investments including £400,000 deposits and Rs. 2,000,000 deposits
                                both in Russian banks which now unavailable and about £700,000
                                Moscow bills, roughly about £1,000,000. Book value of assets
                                unpledged. Officers unwilling to give City Bank additional
                                collateral but say will agree that no additional collateral will be
                                given to British banks whose loans will not be substantially reduced
                                and that unpledged assets will be kept free except to the slight
                                extent that they may be used in connection with corporation’s
                                current opinion [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and new business which
                                will not be considerable. Tait stated at some length reasons for
                                view that City Bank should not demand additional collateral for any
                                unwillingness to respond to demand. I think British Treasury is
                                right in feeling that under the circumstances it is not in a
                                position to bring pressure upon corporation to furnish additional
                                collateral. Will receive information above summary in more definite
                                form to-morrow but situation is doubtless fully understood by Jacobs
                                of City Bank who is a director of Russian Corporation. Please
                                instruct if I can be of any further service.</p>

                                    notes of the Russian Government, aggregating $11,000,000, held
                                    in this country, maturing on May 1, 1918, I propose that these
                                    notes shall not be presented for payment until May 1, 1919,
                                    except for the sanction of the Department of State of the United
                                    States or at the request of the Russian Government. In
                                    consideration of the compliance with this proposal by the
                                    holders of all the said notes, I hereby agree that the Russian
                                    Government will pay interest on the said notes at the rate of 6
                                    per cent per annum, semiannually, on November 1, 1918, and on
                                    May 1, 1919, without, however, any commission. The amount of the
                                    said interest, $660,000, shall be forthwith paid to you by Mr.

                                    paid out by you at the times above stated, to the holders of the
                                    said notes, without further authorization from me. Should,
                                    however, the said dollar notes be paid in full before May 1,
                                    1919, the interest thereon shall be paid at the said rate up to
                                    the time of such payment on the principal; and the balance of
                                    said sum of $660,000 shall be forthwith paid by you to me. On
                                    the balance of the said sum of $660,000 at any time remaining
                                    with you, interest is to be allowed at the rate of 2 per cent
                                    per annum.</p>

                            <p>The foregoing is evidently the outcome of a number of Russian bankers
                                who recently arrived in Copenhagen and a member of the German
                                Reichsbank. Apparently this is another German move towards securing
                                control of Russia, not only of the financial institutions but
                                likewise of commercial houses and particularly of individuals, the
                                majority of whom are nearing the end of their resources and through
                                this maneuver become directly dependent upon the German
                                Government.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The coming 15th of
                                November brings forward the question of payment of interest due on
                                certificates of indebtedness of the Russian Provisional Government
                                to the United States. Anticipating that a demand will be made in
                                time by the Treasury Department requesting such payment, and not
                                questioning <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0100"/>in any way the
                                legality of such demand, I nevertheless have the honor to bring to
                                your attention certain considerations of general and political
                                character which seem to justify my most earnest request to the
                                United States Government that the payment of interest on November 15
                                be postponed.</p>
                            <p>The only means of effecting this payment, amounting to something
                                between $4,500,000–$5,000,000, are moneys obtained or obtainable
                                from the sale of goods belonging to the Russian Government and
                                stored in this country. These materials represent practically the
                                only asset left at the disposal of the Russian Embassy in
                                Washington, and the payment of interest to the United States,
                                together with payments due in December and January on previous
                                loans, would practically exhaust the funds of the Russian Government
                                in the United States and thus thwart any further possibilities on
                                the part of the Embassy to be of effective assistance to the Russian
                                people. Meanwhile, the progress of the national movement in my
                                country is opening promising opportunities and is bound to reveal
                                different requirements of most urgent character, many of which, for
                                certain formal reasons, might not be conveniently met except through
                                funds disposed of formally on authority of the representative of
                                Russia.</p>
                            <p>The features of the case, however, appear especially convincing when
                                viewed in the light of the general policy of the United States
                                toward Russia. Following the announcements of the desire to assist
                                Russia, a practical policy of aid has been initiated by the United
                                States Government and in particular the War Trade Board has been
                                provided with a fund of $5,000,000 to effectuate such assistance
                                which may not be carried out through private commercial
                                channels.</p>
                            <p>Such an appropriation with a parallel demand by the United States
                                Government of an equal sum from what little remains in the
                                possession of the Russian Government will not be understood by the
                                Russian people. Intricate and technical matters of judicial
                                character do not generally appeal to the people’s mind. My
                                countrymen will be unlikely to conceive how an exaction, based on
                                formal and technical considerations, would conciliate with the
                                general broad and open-hearted attitude of the United States toward
                                Russia.</p>
                            <p>Public opinion in Russia will not comprehend the motives of the
                                United States for levying the payment at a moment when any funds
                                disposable are of such immense consequence. Especially when
                                considering the relative insignificance of the amount when compared
                                with the expenses of the war and with the momentous character of the
                                question involved.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, in the conception of the people there is no reason to
                                regard with any distrust the future fulfilment by Russia of its
                                international financial obligations. The most exact and punctilious
                                    <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0101"/>observance of such
                                liabilities has always been a fundamental and indisputable principle
                                of Russian statesmanship, both imperial and democratic. Without
                                hesitation, it may be stated, that any future government, really
                                representative of the country, will consider as its manifest duty to
                                stand by all financial liabilities emanating from legally
                                established international obligations of Russia. To meet such
                                liabilities the riches of Russia and the prospects of future
                                development within a country reconstituted on principles of
                                constructive democracy, provide most ample security.</p>
                            <p>I therefore most earnestly solicit that favorable consideration be
                                given by the Government of the United States to this question. A
                                generous decision, besides being under circumstances of considerable
                                political bearing, will enable the rendering of substantial
                                assistance to my country.</p>

                                        >Polk</persName></hi>: Pursuant to our conversation on the
                                question of payment of interest to the United States due on the 15th
                                of November, I have discussed the matter with Mr.
                                    <persName>Leffingwell</persName> and Mr.
                                    <persName>Rathbone</persName>, who appeared to adopt a
                                sympathetic attitude and seemed prepared to give favorable
                                consideration to a recommendation coming from the Department of
                                State with regard to a. postponement of the payment.</p>
                            <p>We have also discussed the question of payment to private bondholders
                                in December and January. While naturally the Treasury officials are
                                in general reluctant to the idea of giving preference to private
                                bondholders, nevertheless, the point was emphasized of the
                                importance of upholding the idea of Russia’s credit with the
                                American public, and in particular, owing to the latest developments
                                in Russia.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName>Leffingwell</persName> and Mr.
                                    <persName>Rathbone</persName> seemed to be rather in favor of
                                the idea of arranging a conference with the committee of bondholders
                                and of having them agree to postpone, the presentation of the
                                forthcoming coupons. With such an arrangement, one would have to pay
                                probably only a very insignificant amount of interest on outlying
                                bonds held by the public, while the principle of credit would be
                                maintained.</p>

                                and Mr. <persName>Miles</persName> this afternoon in regard to the
                                Russian situation, I take pleasure in advising you that on the 15th
                                instant the Treasury Department received a demand note of the
                                Russian Provisional Government executed by the Russian Ambassador to
                                represent the interest due on that date on the obligations of the
                                Russian Government theretofore acquired by the United States. I have
                                endeavored to ascertain whether large holders of Russian bonds were
                                disposed to forego the immediate cash payment of interest due
                                thereon in the near future, but the channels through which I have
                                attempted to approach the matter do not seem disposed to take any
                                action in this direction. Purely as a Treasury question, so long as
                                the interest on the obligations of the Russian Government held by
                                the United States are not paid in cash, the Russian Government
                                should not be permitted to use its dollar funds to pay interest on
                                its obligations held by private investors.</p>
                            <p>I fully understand that there may be political considerations
                                involved, and this Department desires to cooperate with you in
                                connection with the matter. I understand that you intend to confer
                                with the Russian Ambassador and will let me hear from you on the
                                subject at an early date.</p>

                                that the Treasury should not consent to the payment of any further
                                interest on Russian privately owned obligations held in this country
                                unless the interest on the Russian obligations held by the United

                                the Treasury for this payment be secured. Accordingly I have written

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName>Rathbone</persName></hi>:
                                    I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 11, in
                                    which you state that, in view of the fact that no part of the
                                    interest due on November 15 on the obligations of the Russian
                                    Government held by the United States has been paid, you do not
                                    see how the Treasury Department can consent to the payment of
                                    interest on the obligations of the Russian Government owned
                                    privately in the United States.</p>
                                <p>While concurring with your opinion that possibly the Treasury
                                    Department, from the formal point of view, is unable to give its
                                    consent under the existing conditions, for this matter is merely
                                    of a political nature, I cannot restrain myself from pointing
                                    out that, under request of the Treasury, the Russian Ambassador
                                    has signed the certificate of indebtedness for the amount of
                                    interest due the 15th of November and it was our belief that
                                    this action would give a possibility to your Department not to
                                    insist on nonfulfilment [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of our
                                    other financial obligations.</p>
                                <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0105"/>
                                <p>I want to add that I shall not fail to take this matter up with
                                    the State Department, this question being rather of a political
                                    nature, as it is stated above, and I dare to express my earnest
                                    hope that the United States Government will find a certain way
                                    not to prevent us from executing this payment on the open
                                    market, especially in view of the fact that this is the first
                                    payment after the declaration of the Omsk government that they
                                    undertake to fulfil all Russian national obligations.</p>
                                <p>For this payment the funds are provided, and this being indeed
                                    the last payment on our financial program up to the 1st of May
                                    1919 for the credit operations on the open market in this
                                    country, it would be the very greatest pity should all our
                                    efforts to maintain our obligations to private concerns in this
                                    country, as well as the funds expended to meet our liabilities
                                    during the last year, be denied all their purpose should we not
                                    meet our obligation on the 10th of January, while a possibility
                                    still exists to pay this interest.</p>
                                <p>I consider it my duty to bring to your attention yet another
                                    fact. As you certainly remember on the 1st of May we have to pay
                                    the principal on our $11,000,000 short notes issue, for which a
                                    collateral of approximately Rs. 145,000,000 in 5½ per cent war
                                    loans was deposited. The only way to pay this principal, if some
                                    new credit will not be granted, in the meantime, to Russia, is
                                    the realization of the collateral.</p>
                                <p>You will understand perfectly well what influence our failure to
                                    pay the interest just before we have to sell our deposit will
                                    have on the market of the Russian loans in this country.</p>
                                <p>The success of the realization of our war loan will depend very
                                    much, if not mainly, on the attitude of the National City Bank
                                    in this matter and I do not think that they will take great
                                    interest in this transaction if we shall enter in the open
                                    market after a failure to pay the interest on the 10th of
                                    January.</p>
                                <p>I shall be very glad to take this matter up with you again, or
                                    with any other governmental department, in order to try and
                                    reach a certain common understanding to find the way of meeting
                                    this particular obligation of ours, failure of which, in my most
                                    sincere opinion, will cause the greatest harm to our national
                                    interest.</p>

                                considerable correspondence between the Treasury and the State

                                conference yesterday regarding Russian bonds and obligations in this
                                country, I believe the situation is such that it would be
                                unfortunate if we offered any objection at this time to the payment
                                of interest on the $50,000,000 of Russian bonds due January 10,
                                1919. I believe political considerations should prompt us to
                                acquiesce in the payment of this interest and shall be glad to know
                                that you concur. It strikes me as especially important that no
                                action should be taken which might affect Russian interests
                                unfavorably until the general question of the relation of ourselves
                                and the other Associated Governments towards Russia is more clearly

                                receipt of your letter of the 7th instant addressed to the Secretary
                                of the Treasury, confirming the opinion which you expressed at
                                yesterday’s conference, namely: that in the judgment of the
                                Department of State the political considerations involved were so
                                important as to make it inadvisable to prevent the payment of
                                interest on the bonds of the Russian Government held by the public
                                and which mature on the 10th of this month. While from a strictly
                                Treasury point of view the Secretary of the Treasury would feel
                                obliged to object to the payment of this interest, he appreciates
                                the importance of the political considerations which you have urged
                                as controlling and will accordingly make no objection to payment of
                                the interest above mentioned. I may add that this Department concurs
                                in your view as to the importance of these political
                                considerations.</p>

                            <p>New government here needs currency badly and wishes Allied
                                Governments to guarantee payment Rs. 15,000,000 in six months, 5 per
                                cent bonds, to be sold for currency only in hope of drawing rubles
                                from hiding. Allied chiefs all recommending to their governments
                                request be granted. Guaranty joint and several, but at present rate
                                of exchange total only million and a half dollars, so that if this

                                involved. But such action by Allies would not be recognition of the
                                new government, but would be continuance of our policy to establish
                                business relations with local authorities where our representatives
                                reside. Unconfirmed intercepted wireless states Soviet government,
                                Moscow, overthrown, but if untrue is only anticipatory. Furthermore
                                if the Soviet government still exists, relations between it and the

                                <p>One of the most important problems, which presents itself in
                                    connection with the recent decisions of the United States to
                                    render active assistance to Russia, is that of currency to be
                                    used. It is, first of all, the question of the kind of money
                                    with which the American-Allied troops will make payments in
                                    Russia. Further, and far more important, is the question of
                                    currency to be <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0110"/>employed
                                    in connection with the manifold transactions arising from the
                                    proposed economic assistance to Russia. Thus, the problem of
                                    deciding upon the proper exchange media is a vital practical
                                    necessity.</p>
                                <p>In determining the line of action, following considerations must
                                    be taken into account: <list>

                                        currency</hi>.—Simple as it appears, this method must be
                                        emphatically rejected. The unrestricted issuance of paper
                                        money during the last year has rendered the ruble entirely
                                        unstable and deprived of any character of standard value to
                                        be used in orderly exchange. Due to the lack of confidence
                                        as to the purchasing power of the present paper money, the
                                        Allied troops would be confronted with the greatest
                                        difficulty when endeavoring to procure commodities by means
                                        of notes, considered by the population as practically
                                        valueless. Violent speculation would necessarily arise and
                                        besides it is inconceivable for the Allies to use a medium
                                        of exchange, the very source of which in fact lies in the
                                        sphere of German control. The Allies could not contribute to
                                        strengthen and consolidate rubles now in the possession of
                                        the enemy and could not indulge in offering the Germans
                                        further opportunities.</item>

                                    <item><hi rend="italic">Foreign currency</hi>,—To introduce any
                                        foreign currency would be embarrassing at present on account
                                        of the illiteracy of the population and its unfamiliarity
                                        with foreign specie and denominations. In the future, such
                                        course would be bound to cause difficulties to the
                                        Government of Russia. Besides consolidating the value of the
                                        old paper ruble relatively to a new national unit, the
                                        future government in this case would have to extract from
                                        circulation certain foreign specie, which, at that time,
                                        might become a familiar instrument of purchase and exchange
                                        and the value of which besides is totally independent and is
                                        beyond authority on the part of any institutions in Russia.
                                        Further, under present chaotic conditions, foreign specie of
                                        general value introduced into the country may be diverted
                                        into German channels.</item>

                                    <item><hi rend="italic">Issuing special certificates.</hi>—Under
                                        such circumstances it appears that special certificates
                                        should be issued to be used in connection with Allied action
                                        in Russia. If issued in ruble values and in proper
                                        denominations, such certificates would have the advantage of
                                        being entirely familiar to the population. Their relative
                                        value and purchasing power can easily be rendered stable.
                                        Further, most simple measures would practically exclude any
                                        possibilities of benefiting German activities.</item>

                                <p>Certain considerations of general character are appropriate,
                                    which would render clear the nature and the purpose of the
                                    proposed financial enterprise.</p>
                                <p>It is to be conceived in the first place that no financial
                                    problems of general character may be set as the aim of the
                                    proposed action. Questions such as that of devaluation of the
                                    present paper currency, its extraction from circulation <pb
                                        n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0111"/>and other problems of
                                    stabilization of existing ruble currency can be legally solved
                                    only by a future national government of Russia, whose authority
                                    is well established and recognized and which is entirely in
                                    control both of the means of issuing currency as of its
                                    circulation and foreign exchange.</p>
                                <p>The purpose of introducing a new exchange medium is entirely
                                    practical, the aim being to establish a standard of exchange
                                    with a stable purchasing power which would enable economic
                                    assistance on the part of the Allies and render possible the
                                    resumption of normal economic activities.</p>
                                <p>In the eyes of the population the value of the new currency will
                                    be connected with the possibility of purchasing goods imported
                                    by the Allies, it being this real purchasing power which
                                    psychologically will attribute validity to the new notes.</p>
                                <p>In connection with this the amount of new notes to be issued is
                                    to be determined exclusively with regard to the practical needs
                                    of economic activities, developing in connection with Allied
                                    economic assistance and corresponding to the actual demand of
                                    exchange media.</p>
                                <p>In defining the general outline of the proposed financial
                                    institution and in considering the nature of the measures
                                    contemplated, it is supposed that the economic assistance
                                    brought into Russia by the United States and the Allies will be
                                    directed by a certain governing body, which will regulate and
                                    coordinate the activities of different institutions and insure
                                    unity in policy and action. The proposed financial institution
                                    will consequently act under the auspices and direction of this
                                    main economic commission and actually constitute its financial
                                    department concentrating and effecting all financial
                                    transactions connected with the Allied enterprise.</p>
                                <p>It is further understood that, free from selfish aim and acting
                                    on strictly business lines, the economic commission will
                                    endeavor to extend assistance to the population by giving it an
                                    opportunity of purchasing goods on a fair cost basis and
                                    besides, through extending proper credits and other appropriate
                                    measures, will contribute to the restitution of production in
                                    Russia. In these activities, the intermediary of such
                                    institutions as cooperative societies, Zemstvos, and
                                    municipalities will be largely sought, avoiding possibly avenues
                                    where profiteering and speculation might be expected.</p>
                                <p>For these purposes, as well as for payments by the Allied troops
                                    in Russia, proper stable exchange media have to be provided and
                                    a mechanism, whereby this media could be properly utilized by
                                    the population, instituted and brought into operation. While in
                                    the future it may be expected that the importation of goods will
                                    be, to a certain extent, balanced by eventual exports, it should
                                    be nevertheless realized that in the initial phase import
                                    operations will necessarily dominate. This will necessitate
                                    extension of credits to purchasing bodies in Russia as well as
                                    to importing corporations, acting under the supervision of the
                                    economic commission, in dollars and other foreign currency.</p>
                                <p>The proposed financial institution should be, therefore,
                                    established with a capacity of issuing exchange media for use in
                                    Siberia and parts of Russia, covered by organized Allied
                                    assistance, as well as should be authorized to extend necessary
                                    credits for supply operations of all kinds.</p>

                                <p>The issue department to be authorized to issue bank notes

                                    should be allowed to issue supplementary media against

                                    different institutions and organizations in Russia as well as to

                                        interior circulation and to foreign exchange</hi></p>
                                <p>The bank notes should be issued in rubles, adopting the regular
                                    Russian denominations. The value of the bank notes should be
                                    determined by ascertaining their equivalent with foreign
                                    currency. In adopting the exchange equivalent it appears
                                    appropriate to accept as the relative value of the ruble its
                                    former original pre-war valuation, thus establishing the value
                                    of the new ruble notes on the basis of the original
                                    standard.</p>
                                <p>The new bank notes could in no case be regarded as legal tender.
                                    To issue and enforce lawful money is the privilege and authority
                                    of a national government only. The bank notes should be
                                    considered as certificates, issued for a specific purpose and
                                    used in connection with certain economic transactions, arising
                                    from the fact of Allied assistance. The nature of the bank note
                                    will consequently be that of a certificate to be used for the
                                    purchase of goods imported through Allied channels as well as
                                    for all transactions with Allied institutions in Russia. The
                                    inscription on the face of the notes could tentatively be of
                                    following character: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>The __________ Bank accepts these ruble notes for all
                                            payments to the Bank and to all institutions connected
                                            with it. The value of this note is secured by deposits
                                            in trust with Governments of __________. In exchange
                                            this note will be equivalent to __________ in the
                                            currency of __________.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Although the value of the new ruble note will be thus established
                                    in equivalence to foreign currency, this would not mean that
                                    free and unrestricted exchange to foreign values would be
                                    effected. On the contrary, the necessity of preventing use of
                                    these bank notes by German affiliations would demand excluding
                                    entirely these bank notes from free exchange in foreign markets
                                    and would oblige limiting of such operations to the institutions
                                    of the bank only. Furthermore, following the actual practice of
                                    Allied countries such exchange would be subject to regulations
                                    which would permit the purchase of foreign currency only after
                                    proper consideration of each particular case.</p>

                                <p>As heretofore stated the new bank notes should be issued without
                                    prejudice to the present currency of Russia. Theoretically, the
                                    new bank notes, being issued for a certain specific purpose, are
                                    not to interfere with the circulation and use of the present
                                    currency. No regular exchange of the new bank notes with the
                                    present ruble should be established and no fixed exchange
                                    equivalent adopted. As a matter of general policy the reduction
                                    of transactions with the present actual ruble to the lowest
                                    possible minimum is suggested.</p>
                                <p>However, transactions of this kind can not be entirely avoided.
                                    In many cases peasants and other purchasers of imported
                                    commodities, often cities, Zemstvos, and Cooperatives, will
                                    possess paper rubles as an asset which they may offer as the
                                    only security in the initial phase of their transactions with
                                    Allied institutions. In such cases, rubles might be accepted as
                                    security for credits granted, regarding them strictly as
                                    collateral without specifying their actual value and leaving the
                                    final settlement to a later epoch, when the future national
                                    government would consolidate the currency and determine the
                                    relative value of the present ruble paper.</p>
                                <p>It should, however, be anticipated that the new bank notes,
                                    although not representing a legal tender of general character,
                                    will certainly be favored by the population due to their actual
                                    purchasing power and will assume, after a certain period, the
                                    character of a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> generally
                                    recognized exchange media. It is further to be expected that
                                    such process may extend beyond the sphere of individual
                                    intercourse and that certain municipalities and Zemstvos,
                                    besides railways, banks, etc., might, on their own behalf,
                                    recognize the bank notes as tender to be accepted in
                                    transactions within their sphere of action.</p>
                                <p>In this case the new bank notes would, be eventually accepted,
                                    parallel to present currency, in payment of taxes,
                                    transportation fees, postal telegraph service, etc. However,
                                    such procedure would be adopted and decreed by the local
                                    governments and institutions themselves and certain parallel
                                    rates, announced from time to time, should be regarded more as a
                                    comparative price list in different currency.</p>
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">relation to the future
                                        national government of russia</hi></p>
                                <p>Such recognition on the part of the population of the new
                                    exchange media as tender of general character should not be
                                    considered with disfavor. To a certain extent this would
                                    facilitate the task of the future national government in the
                                    monetary reform. At the moment when the value of the inflated
                                    revolutionary ruble will have to be definitely established with
                                    regard to the new consolidated national unit, bank notes of the
                                    Allied bank, then in circulation, with their firm equivalent in
                                    foreign exchange will happily constitute a well-established
                                    standard.</p>
                                <p>It would be only necessary for the future government, through
                                    proper agreement with the Allies, to assume control of the
                                    Allied bank. Such privilege for the future Russian Government to
                                    take possession of bank with all its assets and liabilities
                                    should be properly stipulated in the constituent charter. The
                                    charter should further enable the Russian Government to
                                    determine a certain term, during which the bank notes could be
                                    recalled to be exchanged for new consolidated national currency
                                    or redeemed in foreign exchange at face value. The guaranty for
                                    such redemption would be constituted by the stock of the
                                    bank.</p>
                                <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0114"/>
                                <p>This provision which would enter into effect at an epoch when the

                            <p>Department has received the following letter from the Secretary of
                                the Treasury: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>A representative of the War Department called upon me
                                        yesterday and discussed with me the rumored shortage of
                                        ruble notes of small denominations in connection with the
                                        necessary expenditures of the War Department in sending
                                        troops to Vladivostok. The subject has also been discussed
                                        with representatives of the Russian Embassy. I have been
                                        unable to ascertain as yet the actual conditions as to the
                                        ruble notes in Vladivostok, nor an estimate of the needs of
                                        the War Department there. I have considered the various
                                        methods of providing rubles in small denominations in case
                                        such a shortage exists. In my judgment the most satisfactory
                                        method would be to have issued against ruble notes of large
                                        denominations, a certificate expressed in rubles of small
                                        denominations and stating that when such certificate, with
                                        other similar certificates aggregating rubles in a round
                                        amount, is presented at a designated place or places, they
                                        will be exchanged for the ruble notes of large
                                        denominations.</p>
                                    <p>Various suggestions have been made as to the instrumentality
                                        to be used for the issuance of these certificates, and it
                                        seems to me that this question involves political
                                        considerations which should be determined by the Department
                                        of State. It also occurs to me that it might be advisable to
                                        effect an agreement with other foreign governments in regard
                                        to the issue of such certificates.</p>

                                following points: (1) What plans have been made by the British,
                                French, and Japanese to supply rubles for their purchases in
                                Siberia? (2) What instrumentality do you believe should be set up
                                for the establishment of a medium of exchange in Siberia?</p>

                            <p>Your August 31, 4 p.m. Owing to the increased difficulties of making
                                payments for our Red Cross and relief work in Siberia, I <pb n="65"
                                    xml:id="pg_65" facs="0115"/>have been for the past ten days
                                investigating currency conditions at Vladivostok. I had planned to
                                send one of the Embassy staff there to check up with Mr.
                                    <persName>Frazar</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d84fn1"
                                        ><persName>Everett W. Frazar</persName>, of Tokyo,
                                    representative in Siberia of the American Red Cross.</note> the
                                facts which had been submitted to me, but in the absence of any
                                reply to my August 24, 7 p.m., Mr. <persName>Frazar</persName> came
                                to Tokyo to confer with me on this and other material questions
                                which required decision. The facts are: There is no difficulty in
                                purchasing either in Japan or in Siberia ruble notes of large
                                denominations, but care must be exercised as counterfeiting is
                                increasing. Notes of small denominations are exceedingly scarce and
                                all kinds of makeshifts are being used, such as stamps and Russian
                                bond coupons.</p>
                            <p>To meet this situation the Japanese military authorities acted
                                promptly and are forcing the yen into use by the issue of
                                headquarter notes calling for yen upon presentation. This was the
                                method successfully used in Manchuria during the Russian war. No
                                plan has been adopted by the British or French whose transactions
                                are thus far comparatively small. Americans at Vladivostok have
                                submitted to me several suggestions, among them the one outlined in
                                the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury. Informal conferences
                                have been held with a view to joint Allied action and some plan
                                might be developed later but is not practical as an immediate
                                remedy. Our military authorities in the Philippines requested the
                                Philippine National Bank to investigate the situation with a view to
                                arranging some method of paying our soldiers. Mr.
                                    <persName>Kopp</persName>, an official of the bank, is now here
                                on his way to Vladivostok and will continue his journey in company
                                with <persName>Frazar</persName> on Friday. In the meantime, at the
                                suggestion of some one in Washington, Mr.
                                    <persName>Annatto</persName>, an Englishman, but representing
                                the Shanghai office of the International Banking Corp., has arrived
                                at Vladivostok and is considering the feasibility of opening a
                                branch there. I am of the opinion: (1) That it would be a misfortune
                                to the Russian people if the ruble were driven out of eastern
                                Siberia by Japanese or any other currency; (2) that for the present
                                joint Allied action is not possible; (3) that in view of our large
                                expenditures in Siberia, we are justified in adopting our own method
                                to meet the situation; (4) that we should act promptly or the yen
                                will hold the field and render future reconstruction more
                                difficult.</p>
                            <p>I believe it will be possible to carry out the plan suggested by the
                                Secretary of the Treasury through the instrumentality of the
                                Philippine National Bank, but before definitely recommending its
                                adoption I have asked <persName>Frazar</persName> to obtain for me

                            <p>His Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires presents his compliments to the
                                Secretary of State and has the honour to inform him by direction of
                                His Majesty’s Government that the difficulty of financing necessary
                                expenditure in north Russia indicates the necessity for introducing
                                a new note for local circulation. Owing to the fluctuating value of
                                the existing rouble notes and to the difficulty of securing a
                                regular supply it is impossible to continue to rely on them. The
                                proposal of His Majesty’s Government is to found a local office note
                                issue under Russian auspices attached to such Russian governmental
                                authority as the Allies may recognize which will issue a new rouble
                                note secured to a limited extent by obligations of such governmental
                                authority but in the main by sterling reserve held at the Bank of
                                England. This reserve would be built up by the purchase from the
                                Russian office note issue for sterling at a fixed rate of exchange
                                all notes required by the Allies in north Russia. The reserve would
                                be inalienable property of office note issue and would be available
                                to redeem notes at the same rate of exchange as that at which the
                                notes were issued. The Allies would thus be paying their bill as
                                they go and no one would be able to reproach them for living on the
                                country. The Allies could gain no possible pecuniary profit and such
                                methods would show a very desirable contrast to the methods
                                practised in Ukraine by Germany.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government presume that this course will be approved by
                                the State Department and they are hurrying on with the details as

                            <p>Following is paraphrase of British argument for scheme: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Above scheme disassociates currency of northern region from
                                        collapse of ruble in other parts Russia which must soon
                                        occur as result of overprinting by Bolsheviks and extended
                                        forgeries. This disassociation is effected by Russian and
                                        not by foreign authorities.</p>
                                    <p>Allies are thus enabled to make immediate cash settlements
                                        for all expenditures without disturbing local conditions and
                                        provisional government can thereby obtain adequate currency
                                        for its immediate needs without straining its credit.
                                        British Government derives no pecuniary benefit whatsoever
                                        from the operation. Russians and all persons trading with
                                        Russia by such scheme have advantage of stable currency,
                                        lack of which has hitherto handicapped business.</p>
                                    <p>To assist conversion office British Government is prepared to
                                        purchase at outset substantial amount of new notes for first
                                        four months of scheme operation, subsequently it is hoped
                                        new currency will form basis of circulating throughout
                                        Russia.</p>
                                </quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>Under this scheme America would deposit sterling in London and
                                receive rubles here to the extent of requirements such as paying
                                army, diplomatic, consular officers, employees, laborers, etc.,
                                stabilizing currency; and [I] find no fault with this plan except
                                the prominence it gives to British financing and consequent
                                advantage. If such scheme could have dollar for basis at rate of say
                                eight rubles for one dollar and New York as depositary for reserve,
                                it would be better financial system and more acceptable to me and to
                                Russians also who suspect British even when bearing gifts. As
                                British Government suggested, however, we might adopt some scheme
                                for stabilizing ruble in Siberia and thereby offset to a great
                                extent British domination of Russian foreign commerce. I await
                                anxiously your view of scheme, also Secretary of Treasury.</p>

                                discussed by his Government for establishment of an inter-Allied
                                bank which is to receive the obligations of Allied Governments or
                                other assets supplied by them and against these to issue special
                                currency denominated in rubles, which by presumption will be
                                accepted in Russia in payment for supplies and services by Allied
                                and American troops operating there. Great difficulty is reported in
                                respect to these payments now. Please advise whether our own

                            <p>The British Chargé d’Affaires has the honour to refer to his
                                memorandum No. 980 of September 5 with regard to the proposals made
                                by the British Government for providing a suitable currency medium
                                for Archangel and Murmansk.</p>
                            <p>A further telegram has now been received from the British authorities
                                stating that they consider that it will eventually be essential to
                                take urgent steps for the financing of Murmansk and Archangel. They
                                would propose, therefore, unless the United States authorities have
                                any objection to the scheme already proposed, to put this plan into
                                operation at the beginning of October. It may be mentioned that the
                                proposal in question does not involve any Allied guarantee and that
                                it will be possible for the British Government to proceed without
                                the active participation of the United States and without committing
                                the United States to anything at all.</p>
                            <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0120"/>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government understand that the suggestion has been made
                                that if the United States takes part in the scheme, the Federal
                                Reserve Bank of New York should hold further editions of any new
                                rouble notes purchased from office conversion by the United States
                                for their own needs. This plan would be quite acceptable to the
                                British authorities.</p>
                            <p>It may be further pointed out that the guarantee proposals under
                                consideration assume a concurrent policy of setting up a responsible
                                civil Russian government in northern Russia. They have also been
                                carefully designed in order to be perfectly free from any idea of
                                economic penetration or from any political complications, and other
                                proposed alternatives have appeared open to objection on these
                                grounds. The present plan has been put forward without any ulterior
                                political motive of any kind and is simply an honest attempt to
                                supply northern Russia with some kind of stable medium of
                                exchange.</p>
                            <p>As the question of providing a currency medium in northern Russia is
                                now becoming somewhat urgent, the British Chargé d’Affaires would be
                                grateful if he could be furnished with the views of the United
                                States Government on the proposed scheme as soon as may be
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>As the Department has already been verbally informed, the British
                                Embassy are advised that, if the United States authorities
                                considered it desirable themselves to take the initiative in making
                                financial arrangements for Siberia, such a proposal would be most
                                acceptable to the British Government, since the remoteness of the
                                Siberian theatre of operations from Great Britain appears to make it
                                undesirable that the British Government should themselves accept
                                direct responsibility for currency required there.</p>

                                made large advances to England which he admitted, but claimed such

                                objection to modifying plan in accordance with my contention, that
                                is to build reserve fund in pounds sterling London or dollars in New
                                York thus permitting sellers Russian products to receive pay

                                here by depositing dollars in reserve fund there. For instance, if
                                we require a hundred thousand rubles, State Bank issues new currency
                                here and we deposit dollars in reserve there at the rate <pb n="72"

                                supplies even to American soldiers, French and Italians. Currency
                                becoming scarce. Archangel issue circulating; Bolshevik government
                                here issued one hundred million in government scrip, redeemable in
                                rubles, but only circulated twenty-six million thereof, when deposed
                                taking the remainder with them. On arrival I advised the government
                                to stamp notes in circulation thus preventing Bolsheviks from using
                                seventy-four millions; sovereign government now stamping Archangel

                                circulation. Allied soldiers will be paid new rubles and the
                                supplies imported by the Allies will be sold exclusively for new

                            <p>These memoranda refer to certain proposals made by the British
                                Government for providing a suitable currency medium for the
                                Archangel and Murmansk regions in northern Russia. It is stated that
                                His Majesty’s Government proposes “to found a local office note
                                issue under Russian auspices attached to such Russian governmental
                                authorities [authority] as the Allies may recognize which will issue
                                a new rouble note secured to a limited extent by obligations of such
                                governmental authority but in the main by sterling reserve held at
                                the Bank of England. This reserve would be built up by the purchase
                                from the Russian office note issue for sterling at a fixed rate of
                                exchange all notes required by the Allies in north Russia. The
                                reserve would be inalienable property of office note issue and would
                                be available to redeem notes at the same rate of exchange as that at
                                which the notes were issued.”</p>
                            <p>It is stated that the proposal of His Majesty’s Government does not
                                involve any Allied guarantee and that the British Government would
                                be able to proceed without the active participation of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>It is further stated that “the guarantee proposals under
                                consideration assume a concurrent policy of setting up a responsible
                                civil [Russian] government in northern Russia.” The memorandum of
                                September 24 adds that the British Embassy is advised that, if the
                                United States authorities consider it desirable to take the
                                initiative in making financial arrangements for Siberia, this
                                procedure would be acceptable to the British Government.</p>
                            <p>The views of the United States Government on the proposed scheme are
                                briefly as follows:</p>
                            <p>The problem in connection with Russian currency both in north Russia
                                and in Siberia is practically identical. In each case it is a
                                question of creating a circulating medium that will be accepted by
                                the people. Probably no circulating medium will generally be
                                accepted at its nominal value unless backed by commodities on the
                                spot so that the purchasing power of the new medium may be
                                demonstrated. It will be an advantage if any new circulating medium
                                should be such as can ultimately be adopted or taken over by a
                                stable Russian government. The ruble originally had a gold value of
                                50 cents. It is now selling at from 10 to 15 cents. If a new and
                                distinctive issue of rubles, backed by commodities, is now put out
                                on the market at what the old rubles are selling, it would be
                                necessary ultimately to redeem that ruble at a face value of 50
                                cents which would involve considerable and unnecessary losses.</p>
                            <p>The problem, therefore, is to put out a new and international ruble
                                backed by commodities and to put that ruble into circulation at
                                approximately 50 cents. This can, probably, be done if, as stated

                                currency to be backed in part by sterling deposits carried in
                                London, presents, in the opinion of the United States Government,

                                Secretary of State and has the honour to inform him that the

                                the Russian currency question, was duly telegraphed to London. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BCR1">Barclay</persName> has now received
                                instructions from the Foreign Office to transmit to the Department
                                the following statement with regard to this question: <quote

                                    <p>The memorandum from the United States Government setting
                                        forth their views on the proposed currency for Murmansk and
                                        Archangel has received the careful consideration of His
                                        Majesty’s Government.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to the first question raised in this memorandum,
                                        i. e., the exchange value of the new currency, careful
                                        consideration was given to the possibility of endeavouring
                                        to give the new rouble a gold value of 50 cents, but it was
                                        felt that in practice almost insuperable difficulties would
                                        arise if the value of the new unit were to be separated so
                                        very widely from the value of the present unit. The
                                        objection particularly taken by the State Department on this
                                        point seems, however, to be due to a misapprehension. It is
                                        proposed that the new notes should bear on their face a
                                        statement indicating that they will be redeemed at the rate
                                        of forty to the pound sterling, and this will prevent any
                                        question arising as to a liability to redeem them in the
                                        future at 50 cents.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to point No. 2: In view of the need for prompt
                                        action and in view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government
                                        are principally responsible for operations in north Russia,
                                        the British authorities have naturally been led to take the
                                        first steps in the new currency proposals. For similar
                                        reasons it would be equally natural if the lead as regards
                                        these matters in Siberia were taken by the <pb n="76"
                                            xml:id="pg_76" facs="0126"/>United States. The new
                                        Russian currency will in any case be under Russian auspices,
                                        and will not carry any guarantee on the part of Great
                                        Britain, and the connection of the British Government with
                                        the scheme will be principally through the medium of British
                                        financial advisers.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to point No. 3: The British Government think that
                                        several months of elaboration and discussion would be
                                        necessary in order to work out the details of a scheme of
                                        new currency of an inter-Allied character to circulate
                                        throughout Russia and Siberia. For this reason, the British
                                        Government have felt it essential to bring forward a plan of
                                        an experimental character and limited application, in order
                                        to meet the urgent military requirements of the
                                        situation.</p>
                                    <p>In the present situation the British authorities think it
                                        essential that immediate action should be taken. The British
                                        representative at Archangel has telegraphed that it will be
                                        necessary to bring the new currency into circulation very
                                        shortly, and the British Commander in Chief agrees in this
                                        view, and is of opinion that it would be “disastrous”
                                        further to delay bringing the scheme into force. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_PMC1">General Poole</persName> also
                                        telegraphed on October 11 that he expected that local
                                        outbreaks might shortly take place unless a supply of
                                        currency could be secured, owing to the government being
                                        unable to find cash for the payment of wages for necessary
                                        services such as those of the port, railway and fire
                                        departments.</p>
                                    <p>In view of the urgency of the situation now existing in
                                        northern Russia, the British Government hope that the United
                                        States Government will not feel any objection to the
                                        proposal to proceed at once with the British currency
                                        scheme, which will be done without prejudice to later
                                        developments or to any subsequent scheme on permanent lines
                                        which may eventually be reached between the Allies. This
                                        course is rendered inevitable by the military exigencies of
                                        the situation and the absence of any alternative scheme
                                        which could be brought into operation without delay. The
                                        British Government much regret that the pressure of
                                        circumstances should be such as to make it impossible to
                                        evolve at the present moment a complete and final scheme of
                                        inter-Allied character. As soon, however, as such a scheme
                                        has been evolved, it could of course absorb the emergency
                                        issue made by the British Government to meet military
                                        exigencies.</p>
                                    <p>The British authorities anticipate that some announcement as
                                        to the new currency arrangements in Archangel will have to
                                        be made not later than the 19th instant. They hope,
                                        therefore, that the Department of State, if they desire to
                                        make any further communication with regard to this question,
                                        will do so at the earliest possible moment. The British
                                        authorities are most anxious to meet the wishes of the
                                        United States Government in this matter, and realize the
                                        importance of united action; on the other hand they feel
                                        that the United States Government will realize the urgency
                                        of the present situation and the impossibility of avoiding
                                        an announcement on the lines indicated above.</p>

                            <p>The Government of the United States has given very careful
                                consideration to the memorandum of October 16, 1918, No. 1148,
                                presented by the British Embassy on the subject of the
                                establishment, in the Archangel and Murmansk districts of Russia, of
                                a new currency redeemable at a fixed rate in pounds sterling.</p>
                            <p>It is noted that the British authorities at Archangel regard it as
                                essential that immediate action be taken in this regard and that the
                                British Commander in Chief is of the opinion that it would be
                                “disastrous” to delay bringing into force the scheme which has been
                                proposed by the British Government.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States assumes that the British
                                authorities in north Russia, in making their recommendations, do so
                                with full cognizance of the proposal, which it is understood the
                                British Government accepts in principle, that a new currency of
                                inter-Allied character be established with the least possible delay,
                                and that these authorities have considered and dismissed as
                                impracticable the purchase for immediate necessities of limited
                                amounts of rubles of current circulating issues as a temporary
                                expedient pending the establishment of such a currency of
                                inter-Allied character.</p>
                            <p>If this assumption is correct, and if the local authorities upon
                                whose judgment the British Government relies have acted with full
                                knowledge of the financial plans now being developed among the
                                interested Associated Governments and with an appreciation of the
                                desirability, which appears self-evident, of avoiding adding a new
                                temporary emergency currency to the already confused monetary
                                situation, then the Government of the United States, in deference to
                                the well-considered judgment of those in immediate touch with local
                                conditions and charged with responsibility in respect thereto, would
                                not desire to raise further objection to the plan of the British
                                Government for the immediate issue in north Russia of a new
                                temporary currency redeemable at a fixed rate in pounds sterling. At
                                the same time the Government of the United States can not but
                                express the hope that, if the issue is made, its emergency character
                                will be emphasized and that to this end a time limit be expressed on
                                the face of the currency, specifying that it must be presented
                                within a limited time for redemption, which time in the opinion of
                                the Government of the United States should be short.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States notes the suggestion that as the
                                British authorities are taking the lead in steps to establish a <pb
                                    n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0128"/>new currency in north Russia,
                                it would be equally natural if the lead as regards these matters in
                                Siberia were taken by the United States. In the judgment of the
                                United States, it would be most unfortunate if a different medium of
                                exchange should be established in north Russia from that which may
                                be established in Siberia, particularly since it is hoped that the
                                assistance inaugurated from Archangel and Vladivostok, respectively,
                                may shortly effect a juncture, in which case the undesirability of
                                having introduced more than one currency would be obvious. The
                                Government of the United States also assumes that this suggestion
                                does not imply a desire on the part of the British Government that
                                distinct “spheres of influence” should be set up in Russia, but
                                merely that practical situations may from time to time throw upon
                                one of the Associated Governments a greater measure of assistance
                                than may fall upon another. The British Embassy is aware that the
                                action of the United States in participating in aid for Russia has
                                been determined only by considerations of the measure of assistance
                                it has been in a position to offer.</p>

                            <p>221. Referring to telegrams Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRS1"
                                    >Morris</persName> and others regarding shortage small currency,
                                local branch government bank is willing issue Rs. 15,000,000
                                small-denomination notes to be released to the public in exchange
                                for [large] ruble notes, the latter being held by a government bank
                                to guarantee small notes. However, it will be necessary for the
                                Allies to bear expense of issuing, which it is suggested might be
                                done by American Bank Note Co. in Peking, government bank stating
                                that they have not funds for this purpose and can not obtain as they
                                are unable to receive money or instructions from the head office in
                                Petrograd. They might obtain from the Siberian government in Omsk
                                but money is very scarce with them so consider long delay certain
                                and the success doubtful. It is also suggested the Allies should
                                supervise issue, bank always holding the large notes which have been
                                paid in for small which would be redeemable on demand in large notes
                                only, no other guaranty to be given. In view of the difficulties
                                encountered constantly by our Army, Red Cross, and Y.M.C.A. in their
                                work in Siberia owing to the shortage small currency, would
                                recommend bearing <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0129"/>all or part
                                of the expense of issue subject to settlement later with the Russian
                                Government. On request I met with representatives of British and
                                French High Commissioners and Japanese diplomatic representative and
                                representatives of British, American, and French banks to discuss

                                        >Polk</persName></hi>: Information coming from Siberia
                                reveals without doubt the most acute shortage in the country of
                                currency of small denominations. This fact has to be accounted for
                                not only when devising plans for economic assistance to Russia but
                                has to be most seriously considered with reference to any plans for
                                the re-establishment of the financial system of the country.</p>
                            <p>Latest information relates to efforts of most encouraging character
                                in this respect. The reports show that a treasury has been
                                instituted at Omsk, that taxes are levied and that considerable gold
                                reserves have been saved from Kazan and moved east. More so, the new
                                government desires to establish its financial system on a sane
                                basis, refraining, by all means possible, from the issuance of paper
                                money.</p>
                            <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0130"/>
                            <p>Actual developments will naturally depend greatly on the general
                                course which the United States and the Allies will adopt with regard
                                to financial policy connected with economic assistance and still
                                more on the forms which this financial aid shall assume.
                                Nevertheless, whatever course might be pursued, the necessity of
                                having sufficient currency of small denominations is evident.</p>
                            <p>The uncertainty at the moment of the exact character which the
                                financial measures in Russia will assume does not justify delay in
                                placing orders for notes of small denominations. In fact if the
                                notes are ordered in the form of small treasury bills without any
                                indication on their face of their value relative to gold, one may
                                obtain currency which might be used as change in connection with any
                                bank notes to be issued in the future. The usefulness therefore of
                                these bills would not be impaired. While on the other hand, one
                                should take into account that under circumstances the execution of
                                the order will necessarily take considerable time.</p>
                            <p>It is the plan of the Embassy to place the order with the American
                                Bank Note Co. of New York for the total amount of 110,000,000 bills,
                                the cost of such an order being approximately $800,000. In the first
                                place it is purposed to order 50,000,000 of the 50-kopek bills
                                similar to those which previously were used in Russia.</p>
                            <p>As under present circumstances these orders can not be placed without
                                the consent of the United States Government I have the honor to
                                present the question for your consideration.</p>

                                financial expert Harvey had a conference last evening with

                                    Commissioner in Russia.</note> Harvey claims financial scheme
                                not British Government’s but proposed by private interests for
                                adoption by provisional government. Scheme provides fixed rate of
                                exchange of forty rubles to the pound and for every reserve pound
                                deposited in the Bank of England the Government can issue forty
                                rubles here. British Government offers to purchase Rs. 100,000,000
                                for paying military naval forces and other expenses here against
                                which deposits two and a half million pounds sterling Bank of
                                England, such rubles redeemable in London in gold at <pb n="81"
                                    xml:id="pg_81" facs="0131"/>value one-fortieth pound. When the
                                President asked whether redeemable in other Allied countries Harvey
                                replied that the government could arrange for redemption in New
                                York, Paris and elsewhere through its financial agents at the same
                                rate. The President agreed with my suggestion that would not adopt
                                plan without conference with Allied chiefs and after due
                                deliberation but remarked that government in financial straits while
                                saying that if project accepted would lose half its value if America
                                did not cooperate, meaning thereby that northern province would have
                                commercial relations with the United States equal to England. Plan
                                also provided that provisional government could issue maximum of one
                                half outstanding secured notes on its own credit only without
                                depositing reserve.</p>
                            <p>Project not thoroughly discussed with Harvey who claims that British
                                projectors offered to pay his expenses and compensate for his
                                services, but he refused both remarking that his only master was the
                                scheme itself; did not explain how expected to reap reward for his
                                outlay and services.</p>
                            <p>I told government that inferior currency invariably drives better
                                from circulation consequently new ruble would disappear immediately
                                and remain hidden until old Russian ruble appreciates in value to
                                exceeding one fortieth of pound; that America and France must agree
                                before adoption of rule whereby supplies for civilian relief could
                                be purchased only for such ruble. President assented.</p>
                            <p>Total rubles circulation was nineteen billion until Soviet government
                                installed which continued issuing same notes as Provisional
                                Government, commonly called <persName corresp="#p_KAF1"
                                    >Kerensky</persName>’s, total issue of which unknown but
                                estimated fifty to sixty billions. Archangel under Bolshevik rule
                                authorized issue one hundred million Archangel notes redeemable in
                                Russian rubles not otherwise specified, consequently includes
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KAF1">Kerensky</persName>’s which daily
                                growing scarcer and imperial rubles seldom seen. Bolsheviki when
                                deposed had issued twenty-six million Archangel notes taking
                                seventy-four with them.</p>
                            <p>If British project adopted will have conversion office to convert
                                rubles into new, the rate of conversion changing from time to time.
                                Present rate would be about five old rubles for four new. Old rubles
                                circulate throughout Russia, consequently new can not approximately
                                supplant the old.</p>
                            <p>I advised President that if scheme adopted should call new rubles by
                                some distinctive name such as Archangel or Northern Province
                                otherwise would have effect of reducing permanent value of Russian
                                rubles to equivalent of one fortieth of pound if issue enlarged to
                                meet requirements of all Russia.</p>

                            <p>Would such issue interfere with plans of War Trade Board? Problem
                                complicated requiring much consideration. I have inquired whether
                                British Government submitted scheme to our Government as <persName

                            <p>723. Conference held to-day between representatives of British,
                                French, and Japanese Government treasuries and ourselves regarding
                                emergency currency for northern Russia and Siberia. Understand that
                                our State Department has been fully informed regarding and has
                                considered plan approved by British and French Governments under
                                which British Government acting alone will create a special ruble
                                currency for northern Russia available for Great Britain and Allies
                                and the United States for expenditures of missions in that region.
                                Assume have been fully informed of this plan by State Department.
                                British, French, and Japanese representatives <pb n="83"
                                    xml:id="pg_83" facs="0133"/>agreed that need for emergency
                                currency in Siberia for requirements of Allies and our Government.
                                British and French have thus far provided for their requirements in
                                Siberia chiefly by rubles purchased in various parts of Russia.
                                Further resort to this expedient undesirable, both because of
                                difficulty in procuring old rubles and because of probability that
                                present Russian Government having found that its new ruble notes
                                unpopular is issuing ruble notes which can not be distinguished by
                                [from] those issued by the old Russian Government. Japan has been
                                financing her requirements chiefly by special yen notes issued
                                either by Japan or Korean Government which, however, will only
                                circulate freely in certain portions of Siberia chiefly commercial
                                communities at or near seaboard. Conference agreed that an
                                international note issue highly objectionable both because of great
                                amount of time required to work out details and because of
                                difficulties inherent in any scheme for issuing currency backed by
                                international guaranty or other international action the chief
                                difficulty being that if currency were made convertible into
                                dollars, sterling or yen as would seem to be necessary, it would
                                probably drift automatically to the market which offered the most
                                advantageous exchange rates which for the time being would doubtless
                                be Japan. French representative stated that French expenditures in
                                Siberia would be greater than those of the United States or Great
                                Britain because of obligation assumed by France to provide for
                                Czecho-Slovak Army. We finally suggested that for the sake of
                                simplicity and speed France should undertake an emergency note issue
                                for Siberia similar to that proposed to be undertaken by Great
                                Britain for northern Russia. In this event France would provide the
                                United States, Great Britain, Italy, and Japan with this currency in
                                exchange for dollars, sterling, lire, and yen while assuming current
                                rates of exchange. British Treasury representative approved this
                                suggestion and Japanese representative expressed belief that
                                Japanese approval would be forthcoming. I said that inasmuch as I
                                had no instructions and that [since,] from indications from cables
                                received by British and French Treasuries, the subject was already
                                under consideration at Washington by either State Department or
                                Treasury Department, or both, I could not do more than cable to you
                                the results of the conference and ask for instructions. I should
                                receive these instructions as soon as practicable as prompt action
                                desired by all. Am impressed with the difficulties of any scheme for
                                the issue of emergency currency for Siberia based on international
                                action and am inclined to regard French proposal as best adapted to
                                meet present emergency provided there is no political objection. AH
                                agree that emergency measures now under discussion may be superseded
                                by more permanent measures <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0134"

                                Previous to the overthrow of the Provisional Government in Russia an
                                order for Russian bank notes was placed in this country at the
                                request of that Government. These bank notes have been manufactured
                                and are now ready for shipment. As the Siberian government in Russia
                                is in great need of currency according to all advices reaching this
                                Embassy, the Ambassador discussed with Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PF1">Polk</persName> the question of the possibility
                                of shipping these bank notes to Vladivostok. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PF1">Polk</persName> did not raise any objection and
                                informed the Ambassador that the Department of State was agreeable
                                to the shipment of the currency, provided the Treasury Department
                                had no objection to this course.</p>
                            <p>The consent of the Treasury Department was obtained and an export
                                license, No. 190873, issued by the War Trade Board for <pb n="85"
                                    xml:id="pg_85" facs="0135"/>export of the bank notes at the
                                request of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1">Ughet</persName>,
                                financial attaché to the Embassy.</p>
                            <p>At the present time the question of available tonnage arose and it
                                was proposed to send the notes partly on a United States transport,
                                bound for Vladivostok and partly on one of the steamers of the
                                Nippon Yusen Kaisha line. Application for a permission to ship the
                                notes on a transport, the space required amounting to seventy tons,
                                was made by me in a personal interview with Colonel
                                    <persName>Cordier</persName> of the War Department, by whom I
                                was informed that the Department would find no objection to grant
                                the permission requested if it was informed by the State Department
                                of its view in this matter.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, I beg to request you to have the War Department advised of
                                the consent of the State Department to the shipment of currency. As
                                it would be greatly desirable to have a Russian official accompany
                                the bank notes to Vladivostok it is exceedingly important to obtain
                                at the same time permission for the person to take passage on board
                                the transport; the name of the official that will be entrusted by
                                the Ambassador to accompany the bank notes will be communicated to
                                the Department of State in the nearest future.</p>
                            <p>According to information given by Colonel
                                    <persName>Cordier</persName>, the transport sailing to
                                Vladivostok will leave San Francisco between the 18th and 20th of
                                November and as it is necessary to ship the bank notes from New York
                                to San Francisco, I should greatly appreciate your speedy action in
                                this question.</p>
                            <p>It is understood that any expenses incurred by the United States
                                Government in this matter will be refunded by the Russian
                                Embassy.</p>

                                negotiations between the Russian Embassy and this Government for the
                                shipment of certain Russian bank notes to Vladivostok, I find that,
                                with the cognizance of the Treasury Department, an export license
                                for the shipment in question has been granted by the War Trade
                                Board. I hope it may be practicable for the War Department to
                                arrange for the shipment to be taken in an Army transport. If you
                                can agree to this I would suggest that the details be determined by
                                conference between your Department and a representative of the

                                currency medium in northern Russia.</p>
                            <p>The substance of this memorandum was communicated by telegraph to the
                                British authorities, and His Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires has now
                                received instructions to reply that His Majesty’s Government much
                                appreciate the action of the United States Government in withdrawing
                                further objection to their plan for the immediate issue of a
                                currency in northern Russia. His Majesty’s Government beg to confirm
                                the assurances they have already given that the issue of currency,
                                now projected, shall not be allowed to prejudice any future currency
                                arrangements for Russia to which the Associated Governments may in
                                future agree to afford their support.</p>
                            <p>Whether the new currency eventually to be established should be of an
                                inter-Allied or of a purely Russian character is a question which,
                                the United States Government will doubtless agree, cannot be
                                prejudged at the present time. His Majesty’s Government are
                                themselves hopeful that it may be possible to merge the present
                                emergency issue in a purely Russian currency, and that any
                                inter-Allied intervention in the matter may eventually prove
                                unnecessary.</p>
                            <p>As regards the suggestion that the emergency character of the present
                                issue should be emphasized by notes bearing on their face a time
                                limit, within which they must be presented for redemption, His
                                Majesty’s Government regret, after having carefully considered the
                                proposal, that technical objections render its adoption impossible.
                                Apart from the fact that the notes have already been printed, and
                                cannot be altered within a reasonable time, His Majesty’s Government
                                are of opinion that the conversion of a currency document into short
                                dated bills would be likely to render it extremely unsuitable for
                                currency purposes.</p>
                            <p>The question of currency in Siberia will doubtless be the subject of
                                further correspondence.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government would much welcome the establishment of a
                                currency in Siberia either under United States or French auspices on
                                lines similar to those adopted by them in northern Russia. The
                                French Government have lately indicated that it may be necessary for
                                them to take some sort of action on these lines for the <pb n="87"
                                    xml:id="pg_87" facs="0137"/>purpose of financing the
                                Czecho-Slovaks. The representatives of the United States Treasury in
                                London are fully acquainted with these proposals which are, at
                                present, of a very tentative character. His Majesty’s Government
                                will welcome their full cooperation in any such arrangements,
                                whether it proves more convenient that they should be initiated
                                under American or French auspices.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government beg to assure the United
                                States Government that the latter correctly assume that the present
                                arrangements do not imply a suggestion on the part of the British
                                Government that distinct spheres of influence should be set up in
                                Russia, but merely that practical situations may from time to time
                                throw upon one of the Associated Governments a greater measure of
                                assistance than may fall on another.</p>

                                <item>British plan for special ruble currency in northern Russia has
                                    been considered by State Department and Treasury. Believe this

                                    discount rubles which would ultimately have to be redeemed at
                                    par, or else of denominating as a ruble something which would be
                                    redeemable at less than the normal worth of the ruble. Do not
                                    think that this point would be sufficiently covered in practice
                                    by any notation on the face of the ruble. Understand Department
                                    of State, in view of British representations as to urgency, has
                                    acquiesced in this plan’s being adopted as temporary measure in
                                    northern Russia but only on certain conditions.</item>

                                <item>Believe steps should be taken as soon as practicable regarding
                                    currency in northern Russia similar to those taken in Siberia so
                                    that two systems can at proper time be merged.</item>

                                <item>State Department advises that no emergency exists in Siberia
                                    except for small ruble notes. Our Consul at Vladivostok cables
                                    these can be arranged for by deposit with local branch
                                    government bank of <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0138"/>ruble

                                    same in small denominations exchangeable for larger
                                    denominations when presented in requisite amounts. See no reason
                                    why temporary needs British, French, and ourselves should not be
                                    provided for by the purchase of existing rubles with provision
                                    for small notes as above. This much preferable to initiating new
                                    and imperfect plan as temporary expedient. It is not intended to
                                    adopt in Siberia even as temporary expedient anything similar to
                                    British temporary plan in northern Russia.</item>

                                        >Polk</persName></hi>: I have been informed that an exchange
                                of views has recently been taking place between the United States
                                officials and the representatives of the British and French
                                Governments with regard to currency of small denominations to be
                                used by the United States and Allied troops in Siberia.</p>
                            <p>According to cables, which have been reaching me lately from Siberia,
                                one is led to accept, beyond doubt, that the new national Russian
                                authorities, at present established in Omsk, would resent any
                                issuance of currency for use in Russia performed without their
                                knowledge and concurrence.</p>
                            <p>I felt it my duty to draw your attention to this fact, for although
                                the Omsk government is not officially recognized by the powers,
                                nevertheless, the very fact of existing authority cannot be
                                disregarded. More so, that I feel quite certain there would be no
                                difficulty <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0139"/>at all in arriving
                                at a proper understanding with the Omsk authorities.</p>
                            <p>In particular one could take advantage of the proposed order of
                                treasury bills in small denominations which I referred to in my

                                clear that the issue is temporary and local and designed to meet
                                Allies’ demand as well [as] to save future embarrassment, it would
                                be advisable to stipulate at the outset that under no circumstances
                                should a total of more than say Rs. 200,000,000 be issued or that
                                emission operations should not be continued beyond one year;
                                secondly, that natural resources should not be mortgaged or
                                concessions given as security for the loans provided for in
                                paragraph 5; and, thirdly, that great care must be exercised in
                                introducing the new issue to avoid a rapid and marked depreciation
                                of existing issues such as might produce dangerous discontent or
                                even panic among those who have hoarded the existing issues above

                                        the United States, exist until after official recognition of
                                        a government in Russia, and the establishment of a stable
                                        monetary unit, at which time appropriate measures will be at

                                        is, in the judgment of the United States Government, in
                                        which we concur, the only means able to give an impulse to
                                        the development of trade between America on the one hand and

                                    <p>Being invited to discuss this plan, we pointed out the
                                        advisability of acquainting the Siberian government with
                                        this plan before any steps were actually taken concerning
                                        the circulation even of certificates of this character.
                                        Having conferred with the Government of the United States,
                                        we find that it, having in view solely the interests of
                                        Russia in issuing these certificates, is anxious to receive
                                        all constructive suggestions which the Omsk government would
                                        have to offer in this respect, and it has expressed the hope
                                        that there may be no delay in furthering economic assistance
                                        to Russia through the adoption of this plan.</p>

                                        transmission to the United States Government.</p>

                                Treasury wish to leave the provision of currency in Siberia to the
                                United States Government but would deprecate the introduction of
                                rubles redeemable at 50 cents into northern Russia where they
                                consider that currency requirements will be fully met by the issue
                                by the office of conversion of notes redeemable at the rate of 40
                                rubles to the pound sterling. The meaning of the words “but it is
                                expected “that the trade notes will be acceptable in payment for
                                purchases of goods imported from the United States is not quite
                                clear to the British Treasury as they gather from the context of the
                                telegram that it is definitely intended that these notes should be
                                accepted. The British Treasury would also like to know whether they
                                may assume that the notes will be available for the purchase of
                                British and other Allied goods in the same way as are the notes
                                issued by the office of conversion at Archangel. The Treasury would
                                be grateful if they could be kept informed of the progress of this
                                scheme. They state that the arrangements which they have made in
                                Archangel through the office of conversion are working
                                satisfactorily.</p>

                                        Department undated received via Peking. Provisional
                                        Government of Russia placed a large order in 1917 for
                                        Russian ruble notes with the American Bank Note Co. to be
                                        issued in the name of the Russian State Bank. The order was
                                        to be paid for from American credits advanced to the
                                        Provisional Government of Russia. Recently <pb n="97"
                                            xml:id="pg_97" facs="0147"/>the Russian Embassy at
                                        Washington informed the Department that the ruble notes were
                                        now ready for shipment and asked if they might not be sent
                                        to Vladivostok and held there rather than in the United
                                        States so as to be more readily available to be put in
                                        circulation when circumstances should warrant. The
                                        Department consented to secure the shipment of these ruble
                                        notes and six hundred cases were arranged to go forward in
                                        the transport <hi rend="italic">Sheridan</hi>, consigned to
                                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">August Heid</persName>,
                                        representative of the War Trade Board, to be held by him in
                                        escrow until instructions to release them should be given
                                        him. It appears in the meanwhile, that the Russian Embassy
                                        here advised the authorities at Omsk that this Government
                                        had consented to the delivery of these ruble notes. No such
                                        action had been taken or could be taken by this Government
                                        as it has not yet recognized that the Omsk authorities have
                                        any legal power to undertake obligations for the Russian
                                        State Bank. Moreover the United States could not be a party
                                        to any arrangement which would assist the circulation of
                                        money which had no legal or actual basis of issue.
                                        Furthermore, the United States would not take part in any
                                        measure to increase or otherwise affect the currency in
                                        Siberia without a conference with the Associated Governments
                                        as well as with Russian authorities. When it was learned
                                        that the Embassy here had conveyed to the Omsk authorities a
                                        complete misunderstanding of conditions, the Department
                                        telegraphed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Heid</persName>
                                        not to allow the ruble notes to be moved from the transport.
                                        The Department understands that the transport accordingly
                                        has left Vladivostok with the rubles which will be held by
                                        American authorities until their final disposition has been
                                        arranged.</p>

                                He said, “Yes.” I told him my impression was very different. I told
                                him we had a distinct understanding with Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName>, that while we agreed to
                                ship these ruble notes it was only on condition that they should be
                                held by some American authority until such time as we thought they
                                could properly be released; that we had no conception that they
                                should be put into circulation until some governmental authorities
                                were recognized in Russia who could be responsible for such a

                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1">Ughet</persName> expressed
                                considerable anxiety and the greatest astonishment. He declared
                                quite frankly that the Omsk government had been bombarding the
                                Embassy with telegrams to furnish them funds, and that finally he
                                had prepared telegrams which were sent over the Ambassador’s
                                signature stating that this shipment of rubles had been prepared and
                                was on its way; that from that time he had no more pleas for money.
                                He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName>
                                had never told him of any such arrangement I described, and that he
                                merely understood the ruble notes were to be shipped to Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Heid</persName>, the War Trade Board
                                representative, to be delivered shortly to the appropriate Russian
                                authorities. He reiterated that he had no understanding whatever of
                                the scope of the agreement under which the ruble notes were shipped
                                or definite understanding that they were to be held in escrow for
                                the Embassy until we saw fit to release them for circulation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_US1">Ughet</persName> called on me again
                                to-day and I told him we were telegraphing the facts to Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BBA1">Bakhmeteff</persName> and suggesting
                                that he would like to discuss the matter with the Allied
                                representatives at Paris. I also asked if he objected to the
                                shipment of ruble notes being delivered to the Governor General of
                                the Philippine Islands, to be held in his custody as a temporary
                                measure until some further decision was reached. He said that as
                                long as the rubles had not been landed at Vladivostok, he believed
                                that was the next best alternative and would entail the least
                                expenditure.</p>

                            <p>704. In the British financial scheme, as the Department is aware, 40
                                new rubles are the fixed equivalent of one pound; the same quantity
                                of the new rubles are declared for the present to be worth 48 old
                                rubles. The official sterling rate of the Archangel branch of the
                                Russian State Bank is 45. The provisional government contends that
                                40:45 and not 40:48 should therefore be the exchange rate between
                                the old and the new ruble. The British reply that 45 is unreal as a
                                selling rate since the bank rarely, if ever, has sterling exchange
                                for sale. This is correct, the rate having been established
                                apparently with a view to the advantageous purchase of foreign
                                exchange. The group of local merchants and bankers who direct the
                                economic policy of the provisional government are aware of this and
                                profit by it. For <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0149"/>other
                                Russians, accustomed as they are to having everything adjusted by
                                governmental fiat, it is sufficient that this is the official rate.
                                It results that the British are incurring odium for what seems an
                                attempt to devaluate the ruble although, owing to the amounts of
                                unsecured currency put out by the Bolsheviks, the real worth of the
                                ruble is probably much less than the British rate makes it out to
                                be.</p>
                            <p>It may be also as a result in part of this 45 rate that British have
                                been so far unsuccessful in selling new, rubles for old at 40 [to
                                48], as per my 665 of December 17, 6 p.m., that they now find it
                                necessary to offer kopeks for sale against new rubles only, in order
                                to give these an adventitious desirability. As an additional
                                stimulant, they are causing articles to be published in the local
                                press which compare the old issues unfavorably with the new. This
                                adds of course to the resentment of holders of the old.</p>
                            <p>Both the above situations may be accounted for in part by mental
                                confusion arising from the issuance under the name of ruble of a
                                monetary unit which in reality is not a ruble but the fortieth part
                                of a pound. Had it been called what it really is—a sixpence or
                                almost anything except ruble—it would probably have been easier for
                                the Russians to understand that it is not worth a ruble but one
                                ruble and twenty kopeks—a view which is supported by the fact that a
                                pound (sterling) note can usually be sold in the streets of
                                Archangel for seventy rubles or more. Having studied the Siberian
                                currency project (War Trade Board’s No. 20 to <persName

                                    corresp="#p_CF1">Cole</persName> and I venture to suggest that
                                it might be advantageous to call the new Siberian token “American
                                trade dollar” or “Siberian” or almost anything except ruble. The
                                difficulties developed at Archangel seem the more threatening in
                                Siberia since the value difference between the proposed Siberian
                                unit and the ruble is so much greater, than the difference between
                                the issues here. It will be difficult to convince ignorant peasants
                                that one ruble is worth more than another, especially when the
                                difference is five per [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] or more; and in
                                endeavoring so to convince them we may—to judge from British
                                experience—quite innocently bring upon ourselves blame for the
                                further depreciation of the old ruble, which is certain to come
                                about sooner or later through the operation of forces beyond our
                                control.</p>

                                observation which seems well grounded: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>2022. At various times since March last the chief supply committee of
                                northern railways has bought in America 42,000 pairs boots from
                                    <persName>Taylor</persName> and 117,500 pairs from
                                Endicott-Johnson through <persName>V. D. Zimdin</persName>, latter’s
                                agent here. Supply committee visited me and after relating
                                necessities and sufferings of their wives and children said had paid
                                Ks. 11,000,000 into Credit Chancellery besides large earnest money
                                to <persName>Zimdin</persName> and had secured tonnage for
                                purchases, every transaction being approved by
                                    <persName>Michelsen</persName> committee.<note n="1"

                                    controlled questions of preference in shipments-of materials
                                    required by Russia.</note> I confirmed this story through
                                Sahmen, director, Credit Chancellery, who says shipment delayed by
                                our purchasing committee who prohibit exportation of supplies
                                purchased otherwise than through it. While think such policy
                                exceedingly wise, I recommend this case be made an exception. I am
                                still looking after transportation interests here and it would
                                greatly assist if could secure this shipment as boots are greatly
                                needed. Moral effect of my assistance would be inestimably
                                appreciated. Have seen cables from <persName>Endicott</persName>
                                representative, Chicago, saying Continental Commercial Bank can not
                                make payment to <persName>Endicott</persName> because Government
                                prohibits transfer of credit in National City. Understand these
                                payments aggregating $240,000 are to be debited to advances made
                                Russia, the Department of Finance having received its equivalent in
                                rubles here from these railroad <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"
                                    facs="0153"/>workers. Supply committee can ascertain prices
                                charged and if excessive might order reduction but if this
                                impossible necessity is so pressing that I strongly advise
                                permitting shipment to clear at earliest possible date.
                                    <persName>Zimdin</persName> is also agent for Robert Dollar Co,

                            <p>2039. Referring to my 2022 of November 24, concerning shoes for
                                Railway Union wives and children have addressed following to supply
                                committee: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Being deeply impressed by your statement that the members of
                                        the Railway Union and their families are greatly in need of
                                        shoes for the coming winter, I immediately began to
                                        investigate the facts set forth in your note and am pleased
                                        to inform you that I have satisfied myself that your
                                        statement is substantially correct. Consequently this is to
                                        inform you that I immediately filed a cable to my Government
                                        strongly urging that the shoes contracted for in the United
                                        States by your supply committee be shipped at once. It is my
                                        sincere hope that my recommendation will be promptly
                                        complied with and I have every reason to believe that such
                                        will be the case. Your assurance to me that tonnage has been
                                        secured for these shoes justifies my belief and is very
                                        gratifying to my desire that the necessities of those whom
                                        you so energetically represent will be soon relieved.</p>

                                if has think should be limited to munitions as continued shipment of
                                shoes and clothing will have widespread effect and be helpful in

                                telegraph as to foundation for statement concerning embargo on
                                shipments to Russia.</p>
                            <p>War Trade Board passed a resolution on November 19, as follows: “For
                                the time being and until further action by the Board to withhold all
                                licenses for exportation of controlled commodities to Russia
                                including licenses for transpacific shipments.” This resolution has
                                not been made public and because a few shipments have been allowed
                                to proceed to outlying Russian territory, publicity has been given
                                to the statement by War Trade Board that shipments to Russia are not
                                being held up.</p>

                            <p>6348. Department has had several conferences with Sir
                                    <persName>Richard Crawford</persName> of British Embassy in
                                regard to shipments to Russia and the position of this Government
                                has been made clear. For your information the Department feels for
                                the present it is important that the impression should not be
                                created in the minds of the Russian people that they have been
                                abandoned by the Allies or the United States Government, and for
                                that reason this Government has told the Russian representatives
                                that all shipments of supplies being manufactured in this country
                                other than munitions will be permitted to go forward. The question
                                came up as to whether railway supplies were munitions and Department
                                told Russian Ambassador that licenses would be granted for shipment
                                of engines and rails. This information was conveyed to Crawford with
                                the explanation that for the moment it would create a bad impression
                                to formally cut off shipment of railway supplies to Russia, but as a
                                practical matter, the amount of railway supplies that could be
                                forwarded, owing to the limited amount of tonnage available for
                                Russia, could not by any possibility be a military factor. Russians
                                hope to ship 14 engines to Vladivostok. Permits have been granted
                                for these, and this Government feels that no objection should be
                                raised to the shipment of this material. If the situation changes it
                                is always possible to stop further shipments and change policy.
                                Supplies going forward are railway supplies, civilian and army
                                shoes, leather, machinery not adaptable for munitions work,
                                agricultural machinery, Red Cross supplies. One small ship now
                                available will sail shortly from New York for Kola and two ships
                                from Pacific coast.</p>

                            <p>Your February 6, 1 p.m. No embargo. On the contrary Department has
                                informed Russian authorities here that all supplies other than
                                munitions will be permitted to go forward. Two ships on Pacific now
                                loading with railway materials, another taking considerable supplies
                                of shoes for railway employees. Shipments also being made via Kola,
                                Murmansk. Department has advised British and French Governments of
                                its position, namely, that we feel for the present it is important
                                an impression should not be created in the minds of the Russian
                                people that they are being abandoned by the Allies or the United
                                States Government. Owing to limited amount of tonnage available for
                                Russia we believe that even in case of railway materials the amount
                                forwarded can not by any possibility be a military factor.</p>

                                    <persName>Leffingwell</persName></hi>: The Department has
                                received your letter of February 21, with enclosures, asking whether
                                the Russian Purchasing Commission in this country should be
                                furnished with the facilities of the Allies Purchasing
                                    Commission.<note n="1" xml:id="d141fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
                            <p>This Department believes that at the present time it would be
                                extremely unfortunate for the Russian people to receive the
                                impression that they are being abandoned by the Allies or by the
                                United States. Consequently, the Department has been assisting the
                                Russian authorities in this country in forwarding nonwarlike stores,
                                including railway material, agricultural machinery, binder twine,
                                army and civilian shoes and leather, together with miscellaneous Red
                                Cross supplies. We have been of the opinion that the limited tonnage
                                available to Russia makes it impracticable to deliver supplies in
                                large enough quantity—even in the case of railway material—to become
                                by any possibility a military factor.</p>
                            <p>The Department accordingly believes that the Russian Commission might
                                still have the advantage of the facilities afforded by the Allies
                                Purchasing Commission. In view of the present German advance,
                                however, the Department would be glad to have brought to its
                                attention all shipments which may be made, as it has obviously
                                become necessary to take additional precautionary measures to
                                safeguard the supplies from falling into German hands. This is
                                especially true in regard to shipments destined for Petrograd or
                                Moscow.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Counsellor</hi>: In connection with
                                the question of the cargoes of the <hi rend="italic">Dora</hi> and
                                the <hi rend="italic">Nassovia</hi>, we have received instructions
                                from London to urge upon you the great desirability of endeavouring
                                    <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0160"/>to secure from the
                                Russian authorities some <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> in
                                consideration of the grant of facilities for these cargoes, and
                                other similar shipments, being sent to Russia.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d142fn1">Correspondence relating to these cargoes not
                                    printed.</note></p>
                            <p>We understand that the position of the American authorities is that
                                it is important not to create the impression that the Russian people
                                are to be abandoned by the Allies, and that supplies of non-military
                                character should be allowed to go forward, so that no avoidable
                                suffering should be caused in Russia through the action of the
                                United States or of the Allied Governments.</p>
                            <p>The British Government are fully in accord with the view that the
                                Russian people should not unnecessarily be made to suffer through
                                the cessation of supplies, but at the same time it seems clear that,
                                whatever attitude may be adopted in regard to shipments of
                                foodstuffs, etc., to allow the shipment of agricultural implements
                                and railway material must inevitably make it easier for the enemy to
                                obtain supplies from Russia, with the effect of prolonging the war.
                                In the same way it is very desirable to avoid any action which would
                                be likely to relieve the shortage of drugs in Germany, of which
                                there is clear evidence.</p>
                            <p>On the general question of exports to Russia it would seem absolutely
                                necessary, in view of the political situation, to treat such exports
                                with as much caution as in the case of neutral countries contiguous
                                to Germany. It is even probable, in view of the apparent German
                                ascendency in Petrograd and of the inability of the Russian
                                authorities to give convincing guarantees, that greater caution is
                                necessary in dealing with exports to Russia than with exports to the
                                other countries in question.</p>
                            <p>As regards the supplies shipped by the <hi rend="italic">Dora</hi>
                                and <hi rend="italic">Nassovia</hi> the British Government cannot
                                but think that it is, in the circumstances, only reasonable that
                                some return should be made by the Petrograd or local governments if
                                these supplies are allowed to proceed. The authorities at Archangel
                                have hitherto absolutely refused to allow the removal of the warlike
                                stores now at that port. These stores, as you are probably aware,
                                now amount to some 200,000 tons and include among other things
                                explosives, copper, tungsten, flax, etc. They are now quite useless
                                to Russia, but would be of the greatest value to Germany, and may
                                shortly be in danger of falling into German hands. They would also
                                be of great value to England, and the British authorities are most
                                anxious to secure their withdrawal, to which as already stated, the
                                local authorities have so far declined to agree. It would seem to be
                                very desirable, and also quite in accordance with the intentions of
                                the United States Government as regards <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111"
                                    facs="0161"/>avoiding injury to the Russian public, that the
                                release of these stores should be obtained in return for the receipt
                                in Russia of the <hi rend="italic">Dora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Nassovia</hi> cargoes, and I should be much obliged if you
                                could inform me whether the United States Government is willing to
                                agree, in principle, to the use of these cargoes for the purposes of
                                barter against the stores at Archangel.</p>
                            <p>In communicating this suggestion I should add that His Majesty’s
                                Government consider it essential that it should be kept absolutely
                                confidential, as, if the proposal should become known, it is very
                                probable that the stores might be either seized by the Bolsheviki or
                                destroyed by German agents.</p>
                            <p>Believe me [etc.]</p>

                                held that it was called by Russian Economic Commission to negotiate
                                purchases of 12 shiploads of locomotives and railroad equipment in
                                Japanese waters. I cabled Department asking about matter but
                                received no reply. Please cable what shipments made on first order
                                for 500 locomotives and 10,000 freight cars, and present location of
                                such shipments. Does Department object to Consul’s facilitating and
                                Embassy’s encouraging interchange of commodities between American
                                and Russian merchants if tonnage provided by latter? I think such

                                in recommending that purchase of such supplies be assigned to Consul
                                General at Moscow as civilian committee making little headway. Such
                                purchases should be made without delay and assembled at Archangel.
                                Consul General is familiar with matter and can engage competent men
                                therefor. I shall cooperate with him if you desire. See my Nos. 50
                                and 44.</p>

                                with Major <persName>Fitzwilliams</persName> of the British Army,
                                who has been in Rumania, Ukraine, Moscow, and Siberia. He confirms

                                fully and is in accord with his conclusions except as to the
                                necessity or advisability of immediate <hi rend="italic">de
                                    facto</hi> recognition of Bolshevik government and possibility
                                of organizing Russian Army. He particularly emphasizes need of
                                Russian people for manufactured articles: shoes, household utensils,
                                farming implements, textiles and clothes of all kinds. He strongly
                                advocates <persName corresp="#p_MTG1">Masaryk</persName>’s plan of
                                corporation financed by Allied Governments to purchase such articles
                                and exchange them for wheat, which could be resold in famine
                                districts, particularly large cities. Such plan (1) would prevent
                                large quantities of hoarded wheat eventually falling into enemy’s
                                hands, (2) would form economic foundation for Allied propaganda, (3)
                                would create better understanding with liberal movement in Russia
                                without involving official recognition of Bolshevik government, (4)
                                would offer a constructive alternative to military intervention.</p>
                            <p>I am reliably informed that Japanese manufacturers have adequate
                                stocks of goods needed, particularly shoes and textiles. I believe
                                Japanese Government would consider favorably close cooperation in
                                such a plan. Goods could be bought here, shipped by way of Dairen to
                                Harbin, and handled with the aid of <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"

                            <p>170. Serbian Minister returned from Vologda to Petrograd, advises

                                all possible haste in evacuating supplies from Petrograd having sent
                                Mason there yesterday. Evacuation supplies owned by government of
                                equal importance with purchases by Allies, therefore I have
                                authorized military attaché to use limited amount of million-dollar
                                allotment for such purposes.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Information
                                    which we have been gathering concerning Russia from many sources
                                    points unanimously to the opportunity and to the obligation to
                                    make our influence felt through commercial lines in helpfulness
                                    to the Russian people. Our facts come, not only from our own
                                    permanent and traveling men in Russia and Siberia and through
                                    the Department of State, but from personal contact with
                                    Russians, with Americans long residents of Russia, and with
                                    Americans who have for many years carried on business in Russia.
                                    Many of these men have been long personally known to me. The
                                    general opinion deprecates military action but urges commercial
                                    action.</p>
                                <p>Confidentially but indirectly we learn that some plan has been
                                    suggested to you through the Department of State. Of its details
                                    we are not informed. I write simply to say that we are ready to
                                    act and we believe we understand what the situation requires. A
                                    considerable sum would be required but I can put no estimate
                                    upon it without knowing to what extent plans of the kind may
                                    have matured in your own mind and that of the Secretary of
                                    State. Of course our desire is to cooperate in the fullest way
                                    with the Department of State should our cooperation be
                                    desired.</p>
                                <p>I write, however, lest amid the urgent pressure brought from what
                                    seem to me authoritative sources for commercial action, I should
                                    be deemed negligent if I failed to put the matter definitely
                                    before you.</p>
                                <p>Yours very truly,</p>

                                <p>The only intervention which is advisable and possible to-day in
                                    Russia is a peaceful intervention starting a trading
                                    organization on a large basis on the Pacific Coast. That is the
                                    only part of Russia in which American trade is possible to-day
                                    after Germany has succeeded in creating on the whole west and
                                    north of European Russia half independent strategical states,
                                    which are more or less pro-German.</p>
                                <p>The Russian peasant, who hates political patronage as much as he
                                    dislikes any kind of charity, is not a bad business man and
                                    needs urgently all kinds of goods which Germany is promising but
                                    not able to furnish. The Russian peasant of to-day has not only
                                    money but also raw material like wool, skins, etc., which he
                                    would be glad to exchange against all kinds of agricultural
                                    machinery, tools, boots, and clothing. These goods should be
                                    shipped immediately to the Pacific ports and could be stored in
                                    Nikolaev, Vladivostok, Dalny [Dairen], and Harbin. From Nikolaev
                                    goods could be easily shipped on the Amur River and exchanged in
                                    the wealthy agricultural district inhabited by Cossack peasants.
                                    From the other above-mentioned places, the goods would penetrate
                                    into eastern Siberia by rail. They could be sold through small
                                    local agents, who are already to-day selling such kinds of goods
                                    for enormous prices on account of the insufficient stocks
                                    obtainable there.</p>
                                <p>The exchange of goods could be done without any loss for American
                                    firms and under such favorable conditions as the population has
                                    not seen for a long period. That would be the first step for the
                                    best and soundest propaganda for America, proving that there is
                                    a nation who can furnish under acceptable conditions the goods
                                    so bitterly needed for the existence of the population without
                                    interfering in internal politics or brutal exploitation like
                                    Germany is doing in European Russia.</p>
                                <p>If this business would be properly started and carried out on a
                                    large basis, it is more than probable that in a short time
                                    further districts would come and ask for the same assistance,
                                    offering their goods in exchange.</p>
                                <p>If it would appear that the railroad system would be too
                                    disorganized for carrying out this problem, the population would
                                    naturally ask Americans for help and reorganization. The
                                    population feeling that this is the beginning of a sound and
                                    permanent relationship, would be interested itself in
                                    guaranteeing safety for the Americans and their goods. But, of
                                    course those firms who are starting this business would like to
                                    have the guaranty of the Government of the United States that
                                    they would have not only the full assistance of their consular
                                    officers but that armed forces could be available for defending
                                    their stores in the ports against robbery or confiscation by
                                    agents of the Bolshevik government in Moscow, which may be tried
                                    under the influence of the German Embassy at Moscow.</p>
                                <p>It would be necessary to sell these goods directly to peasants
                                    and their associations and not to big speculators who probably
                                    would try to get hold of stocks considerable enough to use them
                                    for politics, or big commercial profits. It would be necessary
                                    to prevent from the first beginning that not only those big
                                    American firms wouldn’t be mixed into interior politics, but

                                    in a certain number of years. But, whatever the political

                                    the interior life of the country must go on somehow and the

                                    rights, will be the nation which will be naturally bound
                                    together for future real political life when one day a central

                                flour stating require minimum 20,000 tons within a month and equal
                                amount monthly thereafter. Urged shipments now <hi rend="italic">en

                                Irkutsk I have not heard what action, if any, our Government has
                                taken concerning this matter. In view of fact that Germans are
                                exerting every effort to obtain not only all Russian cotton but wool
                                [omission?], copper, and grain, I strongly recommend that American
                                Government appropriate sufficient money, amount to be determined
                                later, to purchase these raw materials in return for British shoes,
                                dry goods, and machinery. Money thus expended would not be lost. The

                                food and other supplies in both Vladivostok and Archangel which
                                should be hurried as soon as possible into Siberia and Russia. An
                                efficient business organization should be placed in charge with
                                headquarters, in beginning, at Vladivostok. This organization should
                                work closely with the experienced organizations of the International
                                Harvester Co., with American Railroad Commission now in east
                                Siberia, and with National City Bank in European Russia. Apart from
                                such manufactured goods as might be imported from America much could
                                be supplied from Japan and also from China by the removal of
                                embargo. Our organization should also work closely with Cooperative
                                Societies in both Russia and America. I recommend these measures
                                strongly not only to keep all reorganizing materials from falling
                                into enemy hands, but as a strong impetus to encourage Russia to
                                again declare war upon Germany. This policy may be pursued no matter
                                what party remains permanently in control of Russia. If Department
                                agrees in principle, steps may at once be taken to complete
                                organization. Strongly urge it.</p>

                            <p>290. At the risk of being importunate I request again sending
                                shipload flour to Archangel. Besides relieving suffering, moral
                                effect would be widespread. If Germans take Moscow they can advance
                                to Vologda and if Czechs are defeated or leave Russia Soviet
                                government or Germany will control Siberian Railway and Allies’
                                missions here will be compelled to remove to Archangel. If good will
                                of northern Russia gained, Allies will have friendly base for
                                operation and Germans be successfully resisted. Can sell for Russian
                                products.</p>

                            <p>700. The Union of Cooperative Societies appeals to America through
                                its director Berkenheim … for assistance in feeding the people of
                                northern Russia during the coming winter. It is calculated from
                                figures which he furnishes that to bring the necessary grain from
                                America would require twenty-five voyages monthly of 5,000 tons
                                each. In view of the general tonnage situation, if for no other
                                reason, such shipments are obviously out of the question. On the
                                other hand it appears from figures supplied by the Cooperative Union
                                that their appeal should be met and famine averted by proper
                                organization of the distribution of the grain stores in western <pb
                                    n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0181"/>Siberia. According to
                                statistics prepared for them by Prokopovich, Minister of Food
                                Supplies in the <persName corresp="#p_KAF1">Kerensky</persName>
                                government, the amount of these stores, consisting principally of
                                surplus from the large 1917 crop, is from 3,000,000 to 3,500,000
                                short tons. Of this Prokopovich estimates that, owing to the poor
                                state of transportation, only 750,000 tons could be moved into
                                European Russia, but that with extraordinary measures to improve
                                transportation this amount might be somewhat more than doubled.</p>
                            <p>Allied intervention will create that situation of order which will
                                make distribution possible. At the present moment shipments into
                                European Russia are prevented by the Czech conflict, but as from
                                August 1917 to April 1918 only 275,000 tons were moved, it is clear
                                that even in the absence of the Czech difficulty neither the
                                Bolshevik nor probably any other Russian government would be able to
                                meet the situation adequately.</p>
                            <p>The same military program is necessary in order to solve the famine
                                problem as should be adopted if only military and political
                                considerations were involved. Intervention in Siberia must be
                                executed with sufficient forces to support the Czechs in their
                                present positions and to effect a prompt junction with the Allied
                                groups entering at Murman, Archangel. The Cooperative Societies
                                request succor for the eight governments of Archangel, Vologda,
                                Novgorod, Petrograd, Olonets, Tver, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma, but the
                                actual extent of territory which can be defended and nourished will
                                depend of course on military considerations. In order to make
                                effective distribution the front to be created should, however,
                                include Vologda.</p>
                            <p>As in the case of the military program, time is of the essence. By
                                the end of October the Dvina will be frozen and conditions of
                                distribution will become exceedingly difficult. In Siberia also the
                                grain must be moved down the rivers to the railroad before winter
                                sets in. The general plan of distribution must be worked out and
                                directed by Allied citizens. The Cooperative Societies agree to do
                                the field work.</p>
                            <p>Commercial Attaché <persName>Huntington</persName> and Ward well of
                                Red Cross have been present at the conference with the Cooperative
                                Societies [securing?] further data and will telegraph the Red Cross.
                                    <persName>Huntington</persName> joins me in affirming that the
                                relief of northern Russia is a task which our Allies can not and
                                should not avoid. If the problem is not anticipated and immediate
                                steps taken for its solution, the famine will soon take on the
                                proportions of a tragedy such as will imperatively command the
                                attention of the Allies whether they will or no. We earnestly
                                recommend that the intervention problem be studied in this light,
                                that is, not solely from the political and military <pb n="132"

                                In majority cases purchase of commodities and transportation
                                Archangel for eventual shipment or destruction is impossible. Our
                                plan is rather break up concentrated stocks and distribute beyond

                            <p>Our method is to finance Central Union as [follows]: In case of
                                textiles, [union,] following failure governmental department, has
                                received monopoly for distribution Moscow stocks among the peasants.
                                The sunflower oil is shipped to factories in interior where
                                converted into soap for wide distribution amongst population. Such
                                economic warfare is effective, humanitarian, and associates us with
                                a powerful permanent democratic force in Russia. Present program
                                contemplates ultimate finance of Rs. 500,000,000, of which America’s
                                share one-third, equals $17,000,000 at rate of 10 [rubles] on the
                                dollar. Six million dollars already granted, but we must have
                                further credit ten million immediately, which beg you urge,
                                remarking that large part of money actually merely loaned on fair
                                security. Furthermore prompt [advantageous realization] cash ruble
                                sums required by secret [means] selling foreign exchange impossible
                                because: (1) absence foreign trade, (2) painful shortage currency,
                                through nationalization of banks, preventing possessors of current
                                accounts drawing them.</p>
                            <p>However, Central Union is willing accept dollars deposited their
                                account in New York at agreed rate, if possible utilize these
                                immediately for purchases Union [prime] necessities. Accumulation of
                                dollars for speculation or future use not interesting. Again
                                therefore, I earnestly beg that “Goods Exchange” be advised at once
                                through Allied Ambassadors how much tonnage will be assigned
                                Archangel this season. Merchandise and food from the Allies will
                                have tremendous effect here now, accentuating fundamental difference
                                between Allied policy provision and German policy of plunder. Can
                                not emphasize too strongly relapse of economic life of a former
                                great nation to primitive conditions, money has limited use. Head of
                                Cooperatives doubts that prospective good harvest will save Moscow
                                and cities from famine because peasants refuse cede grain without

                                to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to send to Siberia a

                                    cooperate in such a mission in any way that may be required.</p>
                                <p>It is most important that we should learn as soon as possible
                                    exactly along what lines Americans are working and how we can
                                    best consult with them about the general form and details of
                                    organization. Will you please ascertain this? The following is a
                                    rough summary of our views as to the best method of supplying
                                    goods to relieve the present necessities of the Siberian
                                    population. We fully realize that considerations of geographical
                                    neighbourhood, economy of tonnage and available supplies make it
                                    inevitable that the main task of supply <pb n="135"
                                        xml:id="pg_135" facs="0185"/>shall be performed by American
                                    and Japanese agency. We feel, however, that it is highly
                                    desirable to give the supply scheme as fully an inter-Allied
                                    character as is practicable in the circumstances. We have
                                    accordingly examined, in consultation with experts, the
                                    possibility of cooperating by furnishing a contingent of British
                                    goods, and taking part in any inter-Allied organization for
                                    their distribution. It is found that a considerable amount of
                                    goods suitable for the purpose can probably be made available
                                    from stocks of British goods already lying at Vladivostok and
                                    Khabarovsk, and a certain amount of goods of certain classes are
                                    available in Canada and others are procurable from there and
                                    other parts of the British Empire, though the quantity that
                                    could be furnished direct from the United Kingdom is
                                    restricted.</p>
                                <p>An inter-departmental committee has been formed in London to deal
                                    with the matter on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and an
                                    official commissioner is being appointed at Vladivostok to
                                    supervise all local arrangements on their behalf and to
                                    represent His Majesty’s Government on the inter-Allied
                                    commission which they hope will be established to coordinate
                                    Allied action with regard to such matters as tonnage, transport
                                    facilities, currency exchange and principles and methods of
                                    local distribution. Probably this commissioner will be Mr.
                                        <persName>Henry Sly</persName>, C. M. G., His Majesty’s
                                    Consul at Harbin, and I should be glad to know at the earliest
                                    possible moment who will deal with the question on the spot for
                                    the United States Government, in order that our representative
                                    may put himself in touch with him without delay.</p>
                                <p>As regards the actual business operations of supply, we are in
                                    close consultation with the representatives of merchants already
                                    trading in the Far East, and we hope to enlist the services of
                                    some of these firms to act as agents for His Majesty’s
                                    Government for this purpose. Any such firms would act strictly
                                    as the agents for the Government, and not for private profit in
                                    the supply and distribution of Government goods, being paid a
                                    fixed remuneration for their services.</p>
                                <p>The object of utilizing their services is to take advantage of
                                    their business and local experience, to ensure efficiency and
                                    economy of management, and to secure that relief scheme shall be
                                    so operated as to promote rather than to retard economic
                                    rehabilitation of the country. It is understood that the
                                    principal firms consulted may form a joint committee of
                                    organization to cooperate with the Government and to avoid
                                    confusion and overlapping. His Majesty’s Government also learn
                                    that the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank may be prepared to establish an
                                    agency in Vladivostok, and they are inclined to encourage this
                                    step, which will, no doubt, facilitate the measures for the
                                    improvement of currency arrangements.</p>
                                <p>Difficult questions are likely to arise with regard to the terms
                                    on which any goods supplied by the Governments should be
                                    disposed of to Siberian consumers, and it seems highly desirable
                                    that all the Allied Governments taking part in the scheme should
                                    pursue the same policy in this matter. His Majesty’s Government
                                    suggest that this question should be referred to the proposed
                                    inter-Allied commission, to be determined on the spot, in the
                                    light of their knowledge of local circumstances. They suggest
                                    that the two guiding principles should be: <list>
                                        <label>1.</label>
                                        <item>To make the whole transaction, as far as possible,
                                            self-supporting and not eleemosynary (except in so far
                                            as the commission may find it necessary to authorize the
                                            departure from this principle in particular cases). This
                                            seems to be the only way of limiting abuses certain to
                                            arise out of a widespread relief scheme, such as
                                            exploitation of actual consumers by Chinese and other
                                            middlemen, who obtain possession of goods at less than
                                            cost price.</item>

                                        <item>To exclude altogether the element of profit-making
                                            from the supply and distribution of goods sent for the
                                            purpose of relief, and make it clear that the object is
                                            to benefit the local population, and to avoid any
                                            suspicion that the Allies are aiming at exploiting
                                            economic necessities of Siberia, for private gain.
                                            Possibly it may be found advisable to operate on the
                                            lines of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, i. e., to
                                            sell at a small profit to comparatively well-to-do
                                            sections of the population, and to employ this margin of
                                            profit for relief distribution of the necessities of
                                            life, either free or below cost, to destitute sections
                                            of the population in towns and elsewhere.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the above regime should
                                    be purely temporary, pending the establishment of such
                                    conditions in Siberia as may permit of a general resumption of
                                    commercial intercourse on a more normal footing. They suggest
                                    that the inter-Allied commission should be authorized and
                                    directed to watch the situation carefully from this point of
                                    view, and to report to their Governments from time to time.</p>
                                <p>I propose in a separate telegram to enumerate the classes of
                                    goods which, so far as our present information extends, are most
                                    in demand in Siberia, and to give some indication of the kind of
                                    goods which can be made available for the purpose from British
                                    sources. I shall be glad to receive corresponding information
                                    from the United States Government.</p>
                                <p>We are, I need not say, most anxious to work in constant and
                                    complete harmony with the United States, in this somewhat
                                    difficult and complicated undertaking.</p>

                            <p>The United States Government appreciates the offer to cooperate on
                                the part of the British Government. It is apparent, however, that
                                the British Government believes the United States Government has in
                                mind a purely economic mission rather than a mission which would
                                have for its main object the study of the situation and would
                                endeavor to ascertain in what way the Russian could be assisted to
                                help himself. In other words, the Red Cross and educational side of
                                the mission would be very much more to the fore than the economic
                                side. As the personnel of the mission has not been selected, and as
                                the policy to be pursued would more or less depend on the report
                                that the mission may make, the United States Government is not in a
                                position to discuss at this time the questions involving the class
                                of goods which ought to be sent, the advisability of establishing
                                branch banks, or the terms on which goods are to be sold to the
                                Russian Government.</p>

                            <p>The British Ambassador presents his compliments to the Secretary of
                                State and has the honour to inform him of the receipt of a telegram
                                from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>, stating
                                that the British Government have been carefully considering steps
                                necessary to control traffic by sea to and from north Russian ports,
                                especially the trade between these ports and Norway. It appears very
                                important in present conditions, and especially with a view to
                                preventing supplies of valuable materials reaching the enemy by this
                                route, that neutral traffic should be confined to the smallest
                                possible limits and subjected as far as possible to effective Allied
                                control.</p>
                            <p>In April 1916 the Russian Government closed the Russian Arctic coast
                                from the Norwegian frontier to Kara Straits, and vessels were only
                                allowed to enter this area if in possession of a permit issued by
                                the Russian Government Committee in London and the British
                                Admiralty. It is, of course, impossible in present conditions to
                                secure the cooperation of Russia in enforcing these regulations. His
                                Majesty’s Government consider, however, that it is necessary to have
                                some basis of justification for the action of the Allied patrols in
                                continuing to enforce the previous Russian regulation.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government propose, therefore, to notify the neutrals
                                concerned that they still regard the prohibited area as being in
                                force and that vessels can only proceed there if in possession of a
                                permit to do so issued by the British Admiralty. The British
                                authorities consider that the fact of the exclusion of the Russian
                                Arctic from the terms of the Brest Litovsk peace treaty and recent
                                German operations in that area are sufficient justification for the
                                adoption of this emergency course.</p>
                            <p>The British Ambassador has received instructions to bring this matter
                                to the attention of the United States Government, and to add that
                                unless the United States authorities have any objection to the
                                proposal, His Majesty’s Government propose to put in force the
                                arrangements indicated above.</p>
                            <p>Information has reached the British authorities that the resumption
                                of trade between Norway and north Russia is in contemplation, and it
                                is therefore important that the intention to adopt the suggested
                                policy should be announced at an early date. The British Ambassador
                                would, therefore, be grateful if he could be favoured with a reply
                                to this memorandum as soon as possible.</p>

                                tonnage to White Sea. Bring this immediately to attention of British
                                Government and report whether British tonnage will be supplied. Time
                                is short if shipments are to be made to Archangel.</p>

                                say Ministry make a serious blunder in trying to prevent any
                                reference to them in the newspapers and is now facing a unanimously
                                hostile press. The Emperor has returned to Tokyo from his summer
                                residence and an important effort will be made to form a more
                                popular ministry.</p>

                            <p><persName>Baron Megata</persName> called this morning. We discussed

                                make a beginning toward economic assistance. In addition the needs

                                work are all far greater than we anticipated and will require some

                                link them up with economic transportation and supply administration.

                            <p>132. Archangel representative of the Central Flax Growers’
                                Cooperative Association now has 20,000 tons of flax here unsold.
                                Roughly estimated cost will be around Rs. 100 per pood or say $10;
                                terms of sale hoped for are payment in full in a week of the
                                confirmation of the sale by opening confirmed bank account in
                                dollars in New York, quantity and quality divided into three parts:
                                20 per cent first sort, 40 second, and 40 third. This flax grew in
                                the Smolensk, Rzhev, Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, and Vologda regions. Sale
                                is to be franco warehouse, Archangel.</p>
                            <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0191"/>
                            <p>British Government agents here negotiating for this flax but are not
                                hastening to close deal as they wish to reduce the price and also
                                force cooperative to accept rubles in Archangel. A guaranty that the
                                rubles will be paid being made simultaneously with the confirmation
                                of the sale. This unacceptable to the cooperative. I feel offering
                                is to be in favor of the British idea but payment of dollars in New
                                York would not result in export of capital out of Russia if it was
                                understood that dollars deposited in New York could not be moved
                                except to cover payments for manufactured articles needed by Russia
                                purchased in the United States. In this way purchaser of the flax
                                would not have to carry inflated rubles likely to decline
                                unexpectedly.</p>
                            <p>Same cooperative has 40,000 additional tons of similar flax down
                                railroads in the country between Vologda and Moscow.</p>
                            <p>Please reply by telegram immediately and fully how much flax needed,
                                how soon and your ideas as to means of payment.</p>

                                15,000 tons of flour had already been shipped from Montreal to
                                Archangel and that a further demand for 22,000 tons of flour, 5,250
                                tons of oatmeal, and 3,500 tons of oats for immediate shipment from
                                North America had been received and it was agreed that the supplies
                                should be provided subject to replacement by the Food Administration
                                from stock lying at North American seaboard and originally intended
                                for shipment to the European Allies. The Wheat Executive minutes
                                state that the demand was purely military one and that the tonnage
                                used for transportation of the cereals was tonnage which would
                                otherwise have been used for transport of foodstuffs to the Allies.

                                it is very doubtful whether any British tonnage is available for the

                                on the subject of supplies for Archangel and Murmansk, I have the
                                honour to inform you that I am in receipt of a telegram from His
                                Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the
                                effect that the French Government and His Majesty’s Government have
                                agreed to share equally the ultimate expenditure incurred by the
                                Allies in European Russia, including the maintenance of the
                                Czecho-Slovak forces, but apart from the expenses of their own
                                forces operating in Russia.</p>

                                expenditure, so that the ultimate cost would be equally divided
                                among the three Governments. The cost of foodstuffs supplied by the
                                United States for the rationing at Archangel and Murmansk would be
                                taken into account in the total charge to be borne by the three
                                Governments. Moreover, these supplies will be distributed to the
                                civilian population, save in very exceptional circumstances, only
                                against payment in rubles which would (or their sterling

                            <p>139. Entire political success or failure of intervention in Russia
                                depends on supplying territory behind the Allied forces with
                                foodstuffs. It is impossible at present for all concerned to predict
                                when connection with Siberia can be had. Russian people will not
                                fight; <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0194"/>can not be made to
                                fight. The restrictions necessarily imposed upon the civil
                                population due to the military operations are a heavy burden
                                politically. Distribution of food supplies however is an inestimable
                                asset; therefore the military liability should not interfere with
                                the food supply asset. Russians for some time to come instinctively
                                will find everything military objectionable. For this reason food
                                distribution should be exclusively a civil function exercised
                                independently of the army with sole responsibility to the highest
                                civil authorities interested, namely Allied Governments. There
                                should be an Allied supply committee to control importation of
                                provisions or of merchandise and all exports. Some one familiar with
                                the food resources of the United States, experienced in the exercise
                                of victual control, should be sent immediately from America. Demands
                                made here for shipment from the United States should be considered
                                imperative. What is the [Department’s] opinion?</p>

                            <p>Due note has been taken of the intention of the British Government to
                                notify the neutrals concerned that they still regard as prohibited

                                in April 1916; and that unless the authorities of the United States
                                have any objections to the proposal, the British Government proposes
                                to put in force the regulation that vessels may only proceed within

                                associates so that they will be prepared to lend their cooperation

                                Russia should be directed so that the Russian people may be assisted
                                while in their present unfortunate condition against selfish
                                aggressive trade practices. It cannot be left wholly to the
                                discretion of private merchants to determine what commodities shall
                                be shipped to Russia and what shall be the priority of shipment.
                                Neither can the distribution in Russia of commodities received from
                                abroad be entirely uncontrolled. Methods which will make possible
                                the fair exchange of such commodities as are sent to Russia from
                                abroad for commodities available in Russia and required abroad
                                cannot be formulated and put into operation except under the
                                guidance of some agency other than those afforded by private
                                enterprise. The United States Government accordingly proposes to
                                permit its merchants to trade with Russia only under such direction
                                on its part as will insure to the Russian people absolute fair
                                dealing and complete protection against exploitation and
                                profiteering.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government proposes to control the economic relief
                                it offers the Russian people through the instrumentality of the War
                                Trade Board. The War Trade Board charged as it now is with the
                                control of exports from and imports to the United States is
                                peculiarly equipped to take charge of and direct the activities of
                                the United States in this connection. Its representatives in the
                                Allied countries and in the neutral countries of Europe have for
                                many months past been cooperating closely and harmoniously with the
                                representatives of our associates respecting the many questions
                                arising by reason of the control of exports and imports
                                generally.</p>
                            <p>In the very near future the War Trade Board proposes to make a public
                                announcement to the effect that it is prepared to receive from <pb
                                    n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0199"/>merchants in the United
                                States applications for licenses for shipments to Russia and that
                                licenses will be granted only under regulations designed to control
                                shipments in conformity with the policy of the United States
                                Government as set forth above. So as to provide the Russian people
                                in certain localities with commodities, which on account of the
                                nature thereof or the risks connected with distribution, or for some
                                other reason, will not be purchased or shipped by private merchants,
                                the President has made available to the War Trade Board the sum of
                                $5,000,000 for utilization as a revolving fund. For the convenient
                                handling of this fund and to promote the accomplishment of the other
                                purposes herein set forth, the War Trade Board proposes to organize
                                a corporation the entire capital of which shall be owned by the
                                United States. The corporation may participate in any plan which may
                                be adopted for the establishment of a medium of exchange to
                                facilitate such sales or purchases.</p>
                            <p>The views of the United States Government with reference to the
                                establishment of a medium of exchange or currency in Russia
                                necessary for the development of plans for economic relief may be
                                summarized as follows:</p>
                            <p>The problem in connection with Russian currency both in north Russia
                                and in Siberia is practically identical. In each case it is a
                                question of creating a circulating medium that will be accepted by
                                the people. Probably no circulating medium will generally be
                                accepted at its nominal value unless backed by commodities on the
                                spot so that the purchasing power of the new medium may be
                                demonstrated. It will be an advantage if any new circulating medium
                                should be such as can ultimately be adopted or taken over by a
                                stable Russian government. The ruble originally had a gold value of
                                about 50 cents. It is now selling at from 10 to 15 cents. If a new
                                and distinctive issue of a currency denominated rubles is now put
                                out on the market at what the old rubles are selling, it would
                                probably be necessary, in order to avoid charges of bad faith,
                                ultimately to redeem that ruble at a face value of about 50 cents
                                which would involve considerable and unnecessary losses. The
                                problem, therefore, is to put out a new and international ruble
                                backed by commodities and to put the ruble into circulation at
                                approximately 50 cents. These rubles would by their terms provide
                                for redemption in commodities with proper and elastic provision for
                                conversion, under circumstances and at rates from time to time, into
                                credits in New York, London, Paris, and such other points as may be
                                determined. This can, probably, be done if, as stated above, the
                                international ruble is backed by commodities so that its purchasing
                                power may be at once demonstrated.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government suggests that if its associates find
                                themselves able to agree in principle with its views as set forth
                                    <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0200"/>above they each take
                                the necessary steps to establish a similar form of control over
                                their nationals in respect to imports from and exports to Russia as
                                that contemplated by the United States. If this is done and if
                                corporations are set up by the respective governments similar to
                                that proposed by the War Trade Board the Government of the United
                                States further suggests that the Allied representatives at Archangel
                                and Vladivostok confer from time to time so as to coordinate the
                                economic relief provided by the separate governments. It would be
                                through the instrumentality of such Allied representatives that any
                                issue of a medium of exchange or currency would be made. United
                                States and Allied representatives now meet informally in Allied
                                countries and in neutral European countries for the purpose of
                                coordinating the policy of the United States and the Allies in
                                respect to the control of exports and imports generally.</p>
                            <p>The proposals of the Government of the United States are made with
                                the full realization of the fact that the problem presented is full
                                of difficulties and that probably no plan can be devised in theory
                                which in operation will not necessarily have to be modified to meet
                                practical conditions which cannot be foreseen. In the judgment of
                                the United States Government the plan of action it has, after much
                                consideration, decided upon for itself will allow it effectively to
                                carry out its repeatedly avowed policy of serving the Russian
                                people.</p>

                                    order to ascertain the character and amounts of goods which will

                                    will at once issue a public statement to the effect that
                                    applications to export goods to Siberia will now be considered.
                                    We believe that this announcement will lead to a very large
                                    number of applications, through which we will ascertain the
                                    character and amount of goods which may be available for

                                    risk as too great to warrant their assuming the same. This sum
                                    will also be available to purchase needed supplies which may be
                                    available locally or in Japan or Manchuria and which should be
                                    procured there to save tonnage. We have not yet determined the
                                    machinery through which the $5,000,000 fund will be

                                    This tonnage will, however, in part be utilized for the

                                <item>In exercising the power of control which will thus be
                                    conferred upon you, you will have in mind the following
                                    considerations: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The manner and terms
                                    of sale must be such as to insure the supplies reaching on
                                    equitable terms the actual consumers who need the same. While a
                                    profit must be allowed the exporter which will be reasonable,
                                    taking into account the risks involved, it is of the utmost
                                    importance that excessive profits be avoided, and that no basis
                                    be permitted for charges of exploitation. We suggest that
                                    possibly these results can best be secured by causing the
                                    imported goods to be sold to representatives of various
                                    cooperative societies in whom you have confidence. You will be
                                    able to judge of the value of this suggestion and you may desire
                                    to recommend another plan. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) With
                                    reference to the place of sale, you will have clearly in mind
                                    the military situation and the importance of creating a friendly
                                    population in the areas where American and other Allied troops
                                    are operating. We also regard it as most important that supplies
                                    be made available to Russians located in the areas where the
                                    Czecho-Slovaks are operating, or along the route over which
                                    supplies to the Czecho-Slovaks are to be shipped, otherwise, if
                                    clothing, etc., are to be shipped to the Czecho-Slovaks over
                                    territory occupied by Russians who are in urgent need of such
                                    supplies, we feel that great jealousy and ill feeling would be
                                    created toward the Czecho-Slovaks. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) To
                                    the extent that the terms of sale involve a barter of
                                    commodities, we will desire you to exercise your control, having
                                    in mind (1) the importance of securing supplies which might
                                    otherwise become available to the enemy, and (2) the securing of
                                    commodities which are of a kind desired for import into the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of a circular of
                                October 11 stating that on October 10 the Department had handed to
                                the Ambassadors of Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Russia, and
                                Minister of China an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>. This
                                circular sets forth that the United States will regulate the
                                commerce of its citizens with Russia, placing same under control of
                                War Trade Board. The circular states that the Allied countries have
                                been asked to express their views concerning the plan and to suggest
                                modifications thereof; it also says that by regulating the price and
                                distribution of imports with relation to the value of Russian
                                products taken in exchange, it is hoped that the antewar value of
                                the ruble, 50 cents gold (51.45 cents), will be restored in
                                time.</p>
                            <p>This is a very comprehensive scheme, and I think it is much better
                                than the appointment of a commission composed of prominent men who
                                could do nothing more than come to Russia, hold meetings, express
                                good will and give advice.</p>
                            <p>I am impatient to know what reply our allies will make to this
                                proposition, especially our British cousins. England, or her
                                subjects, had considerable interests in Russia before the war, and
                                while they have suffered, they have not experienced nearly the
                                losses the Germans have. The Germans set about recouping their
                                losses immediately <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0206"/>after
                                the Russian Army was demobilized or even before. The Bolshevik
                                government, if not German agents, was completely under the control
                                of Germans. The economic and unpublished provisions of the Brest
                                Litovsk treaty gave Germany many large important commercial
                                advantages—exclusive in some instances. <persName corresp="#p_RL1"
                                    >Col. Raymond Robins</persName>, I have heard and advised the
                                Department, when he returned to America in May, was the bearer of a
                                proposition from the Soviet government proffering to our Government
                                like advantages and concessions. The Bolshevik government was
                                treacherous to its German pledges and thought it could induce us
                                into making agreements to the exclusion of our allies. I have asked
                                the Department if <persName corresp="#p_RL1">Colonel
                                    Robins</persName> presented such proposals and advocated their
                                acceptance, but have received no reply. Again, I should like to be
                                informed on this subject if the Department will permit.</p>
                            <p>The general conduct and bearing of all British representatives,
                                military and civil, at Archangel and Murmansk indicates a belief or
                                feeling on their part that if they do not have exclusive privileges
                                at these ports, they should have, and they will not be contented
                                with not having a decided advantage. Every move on their part
                                indicates a desire to gain a strong foothold. There were 20,000 tons
                                of flax in Archangel and the British, after stating to the French
                                and our representatives that we should not compete therefor and thus
                                advance the price to unreasonable figures, and after we consented
                                thereto, contracted for the entire holdings of the Cooperatives.
                                Three thousand tons were apportioned to us (by what authority, I
                                have been unable to ascertain, although I have cabled the Department
                                and Consul <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Cole</persName> has also) and
                                as same is shipped, Captain Proctor, the British representative,

                            <p>I cabled you (see my No. 483 of October 15<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d213fn1">Not printed.</note>) that Lieut. <persName>Hugh
                                    S. Martin</persName>, our representative at Murmansk, had sent
                                me confidential information by Mr. <persName>Crawford
                                    Wheeler</persName>, ranking secretary of Y.M.C.A. in Russia,
                                that he had proof that the British were attempting to negotiate
                                commercial treaties of an exclusive preferential character with the
                                Russians at Murmansk. I can not believe this is true, but am waiting
                                the arrival of <persName>Lieutenant Martin</persName> before making
                                    <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0207"/>up my mind on the
                                subject. The British have been experienced in international commerce
                                for centuries, and consequently they have the advantage over others
                                who have less experience.</p>
                            <p>The Russian problem is difficult of solution and even if peace is
                                established the Russian difficulties will not be adjusted thereby.
                                If the destiny of Russia is referred to her own people to work out,
                                they will almost surely engage in civil strife. If some scheme such
                                as the Department has proposed is not adopted and the economic
                                resources of this enormous country are preyed upon by adventurers or
                                even by reputable business men or by great corporations, the outcome
                                will be unsatisfactory to the Russians and the result may be
                                deplorable.</p>

                            <p>2. In conference with War Industries Board it developed to-day that
                                shipments of flax per <hi rend="italic">Somali, Nagoya, Aideus</hi>,
                                and <hi rend="italic">Ascutney</hi> totaling about 5,000 tons
                                represent our full requirements Russian flax for next year. We also
                                require and expect to receive 1,000 tons and some tow from Canada;
                                also 2,500 tons Irish flax of better quality which we need to meet
                                our absolute necessities.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, we do not need 2,440 tons Archangel flax which we are
                                advised by cable from London was allotted by Great Britain October
                                17 for shipment to United States and are not prepared grant license
                                to import it if it is British owned. Therefore, if British owned, we
                                suggest this 2,440 tons be discharged in England. If, however, there
                                is available Russian-owned flax, the importation of which into the
                                United States would result in the establishment here of Russian
                                credit, which would be available, under our direction, for the
                                purchase of American merchandise to be shipped to Russia, then we
                                would be willing to grant licenses to import the Russian-owned flax
                                as evidence of our desire to assist Russia.</p>

                                <p>The work of restricting supplies to the enemy from northern
                                    Russia was commenced about May 15, 1918. It will be remembered
                                    that, at the time, the Bolsheviks were wavering whether to
                                    maintain the pro-Ally sympathies of the Russian people or
                                    whether the interests of the Russian revolution demanded
                                    harmonious work with the Germans, which obviously would be
                                    advantageous to the Germans as well. The success of the German
                                    arms on the western front during the months of March, April, and
                                    May apparently convinced the Bolsheviks, however, that Germany
                                    represented a greater menace to the Soviet government than the
                                    Allies did, and that sooner or later Germany, tempted by the
                                    vast stores of materials and supplies in raw, semi and fully
                                    manufactured state, would penetrate into the country beyond the
                                    region already controlled by the Germans. With this theory in
                                    mind, it was obvious to the Soviet government that Petrograd
                                    would be the object of the prime and great thrust because of the
                                    booty to be gained as well as the military and political
                                    significance of the act.</p>
                                <p>Actuated by these fears, the Soviet government decided to
                                    continue and in fact develop the evacuation of that city
                                    (Petrograd)—the evacuation having been first commenced in
                                    February 1918, before the Brest Litovsk peace was signed.</p>
                                <p>Allied representatives immediately offered their services and
                                    experience to the Soviet authorities in Petrograd—the interests
                                    of the Bolsheviks and the Allies coinciding at the time.</p>
                                <p>The following is a <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> of the
                                    evacuation of Petrograd which was commenced on a broad scale
                                    about May 15 and continued with varying intensity and with
                                    constant interruptions, of minor or more serious nature, up to
                                    August 1, when, because of apparent assurances made by the
                                    Germans that no invasion of Soviet territory would take place,
                                    the evacuation was stopped.</p>
                                <p>On August 1, when the evacuation was definitely abandoned, the

                                    valuable materials and supplies in Petrograd and immediate
                                    industrial centers such as Sestroretsk (rifle factory), Okhta
                                    (powder works), Sehlüsselburg (powder works).</p>
                                <p>Most of the shipments made by waterways have arrived at their
                                    destinations, i. e., Volga towns, and consequently are now or
                                    have been in the hands of the Czecho-Slovak troops. The
                                    shipments by rail were more broadly distributed. The rubber
                                    products, tires particularly, were shipped to Moscow where they
                                    now remain despite repeatedly recurring reports to the effect
                                    that such were shipped to Germany. The raw rubber went into the
                                    interior along the Petrograd-Vologda-Perm railway but was
                                    diverted to Yaroslavl. Much of this has been probably destroyed
                                    by the heavy bombardment of the city. Considerable machinery and
                                    artillery was sent to Perm. Large rail shipments were made to
                                    Ekaterinburg.</p>
                                <p>The Government munitions and armament works have been dismantled
                                    and the machinery scattered about Russia.</p>
                                <p>As an aggregate quantity, there is still considerable material in
                                    the north of Russia but this is so scattered that it will be
                                    almost next to impossible to assemble larger quantities. …</p>
                                <p>Summarized, Petrograd and adjoining district are stripped of
                                    valuable materials and supplies. …</p>

                            <p>Supplementing our instructions for you to prepare to proceed at once
                                to Archangel, we give you herewith a brief summary of our
                                understanding of the economic and financial problems which it is
                                desired you should study at Archangel.</p>

                            <p>In view of approaching winter and difficulty or impossibility of
                                maintaining trade with northern Russia, the most pressing matter is
                                in our opinion the currency question. The currency problem is one
                                which arises in all portions of Russia and Siberia where Allies are
                                operating, and the War Trade Board working with the State and
                                Treasury Departments has submitted to the President a memorandum as
                                to the policy of the United States in dealing with the currency
                                situation, which memorandum the President has approved. This
                                memorandum contained the following language: …</p>
                            <p>The foregoing point of view was presented to the British, French, and

                                familiar. … Our plan for an international ruble has been discussed
                                with leading American bankers and they see no serious objections
                                thereto, nor is it apparent why any great length of time would be
                                required to put it into operation, provided the Associated
                                Governments wholeheartedly accept the plan.</p>
                            <p>We desire you to study this entire situation at Archangel and report
                                to us as promptly as possible your views. You are authorized to use
                                your influence with the local British authorities to secure an
                                acceptance of our views, provided, after investigating, you regard
                                them as practical.</p>
                            <p>With regard to commodity problems, our previous cables will have
                                indicated to you the general character of our plans. We regard it as
                                of the utmost importance that all imports into Russia for the time
                                being be distributed under Allied supervision so as to prevent
                                profiteering and exploitation and to insure the goods’ being
                                disposed of so as to accomplish the maximum of good from an Allied
                                point of view. We have authorized Consul <persName corresp="#p_CF1"
                                    >Cole</persName> to take steps to create an organization which
                                can handle imports from the United States in accordance with our
                                plans and we understand that there are at Archangel representatives
                                of Cooperative Societies who desire to arrange for exchange of
                                commodities with the United States. We desire you to investigate and
                                report on the possibility of such exchange and also to report on
                                whether imports from Great Britain will be handled by a British
                                official organization sympathetic with our views and acting in
                                harmony with our own organization. Please also advise, unless Consul

                                desirable to establish in Scandinavia, presumably in Stockholm, some
                                organization to cooperate with British and French for accomplishment
                                of such purposes as preventing supplies going into Russia to
                                undesirable consignees or in furtherance of Germany’s economic
                                plans; handling as soon as possible goods of Allied origin so that
                                they can be used in Russia in Allied and Russian interests in
                                somewhat the same manner as is contemplated by our plans for
                                Vladivostok and Archangel; securing desirable goods of Russian
                                origin so as to prevent their reaching Germany. American military
                                attaché at Archangel reports that he feels effective Russian work
                                can now be done from Stockholm … Please cable us your views fully on
                                these matters.</p>
                            <p>War Trade Board has appointed <persName corresp="#p_HA1">August
                                    Heid</persName> as its representative at Vladivostok and Consul

                                Archangel. Each is authorized to build up an organization under him
                                to control distribution of commodities imported under license of War
                                Trade Board and we propose for the present to allow no imports into
                                Russia unless exporter consents to consignment to War Trade Board
                                organization which will determine to whom and where commodities
                                shall be sold and the terms of sale. This control will be exercised
                                to prevent exploitation and profiteering and to permit goods to
                                reach the actual consumers who need the same and who are located
                                where it is most important that American aid and sympathy be felt.
                                We expect that shipment of commodities will shortly commence to

                                                [hundred?] million. T. had contracted to furnish two

                                                Moreover, T. having difficulty in obtaining rubles,
                                                has agreed with Central Union of Cooperatives that

                                    <p>It is possible for instance that to save oil already
                                        purchased in the Kuban, T. will be forced to increase
                                        purchase price by paying certain indemnity to the sellers
                                        who received 40 rubles per pood originally under Bolshevik
                                        control, whereas price is now two [hundred] fifty rubles.
                                        Some of the oil is still in the Kuban and the sellers are
                                        seeking to retake possession so that it will be necessary to
                                        make some arrangement with them for this purpose. I should
                                        be able to furnish at least 50,000,000 rubles to the Central
                                        Union as a loan to be paid as soon as the oil is delivered
                                        to the consumer.</p>
                                    <p>As to the textiles, recent agreement with [between] Germany
                                        and the Soviet government provides for payment of indemnity
                                        of 5,000,000,000 especially in form of shipment of textiles
                                        and hides. Up to this time neither the Soviet government nor
                                        Germany have ever requisitioned goods belonging to the
                                        Central Union. It is therefore desirable to help Central
                                        Union to get hold of largest quantity possible of textiles
                                        and for this item T. needs 50,000,000. To provide for these
                                        two operations, T. ought therefore to have 100,000,000
                                        reserve.</p>
                                    <p>Finally French Government has recommended to T. to make every
                                        effort to keep flax and hemp from falling into German hands.
                                        This flax and hemp are moreover needed by all the Allies.
                                        Therefore T. ought to be enabled to buy 100,000,000 worth
                                        now located in territory in the vicinity of the German
                                        occupation which is for sale by the holders and to hold it
                                        in a safe place until it can be exported.</p>

                            <p>19. Following press notice expressing the purposes of the Russian
                                Bureau was issued Saturday [November 30]: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The War Trade Board of the United States Russian Bureau,
                                        Inc., is a company which has been organized by the War Trade
                                        Board at the direction of the President for the purpose of
                                        helping the Russians to help themselves in stabilizing the
                                        economic situation in Russia. It has a capital of $5,000,000
                                        which has been issued and paid up in cash out of Government
                                        funds and the stock is owned in its entirety by the United
                                        States Government.</p>
                                    <p>The company will engage in the business of exporting to
                                        Russia and Siberia, agricultural implements, shoes,
                                        clothing, and other commodities which the Russian population
                                        need, bringing back Russian and Siberian raw materials in
                                        return. The company thus is intended to aid in supplying the
                                        needs of the people of Russia, in encouraging Russian
                                        production and trade and assisting in the marketing of
                                        Russian products in America and their exchange for American
                                        goods. One of the chief objects which the company will have
                                        in view will be the encouragement of private capital to
                                        engage in trade in Russia and Siberia, as shipping becomes
                                        available for the purpose. Its policy will be to cooperate
                                        with, encourage and promote such trade with Russia as will
                                        assist in the rehabilitation of her economic life, and only
                                        to cover by its direct operations such portions of the field
                                        as can not at present be served readily by private
                                        capital.</p>
                                    <p>The company has already begun the transaction of business by
                                        the dispatch of three vessels from the Pacific coast to
                                        Vladivostok carrying commodities which its representative in
                                        Siberia has designated as being most urgently needed there.
                                        By addressing the Russian Bureau, persons interested in
                                        Russian trade may receive more <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170"

                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>I wish to bring to your attention the following with regard
                                        to the Russian situation:</p>
                                    <p>Since the conclusion of the armistice, the general condition
                                        of world trade has altered very materially, and this
                                        alteration has greatly increased the accessibility of Russia
                                        to foreign traders. The cessation of hostilities has made it
                                        necessary for the War Trade Board to relax, to a large
                                        extent, their restrictions upon exports and imports with
                                        respect to almost every country of the world, because the
                                        necessity of conserving our own domestic resources through
                                        export restrictions and conserving tonnage through import
                                        restrictions has practically disappeared. The War Trade
                                        Board feel that they can not effectively prevent trade with
                                        Russia through China and Japan and it is now possible to
                                        trade freely with Russia through China and Japan without any
                                        reference whatsoever to the control of the War Trade Board.
                                        The only means of controlling such transit traffic is by
                                        requiring in the case of exports through China or Japan -a
                                        guarantee against reexport, but this control is at best an
                                        ineffective one and not susceptible of complete enforcement,
                                        and accordingly we do not regard it as practicable. It
                                        appears that there is available for Russian trade an amount
                                        of shipping which is more than sufficient to carry all the
                                        commodities which the Russians are able to absorb under the
                                        present chaotic conditions.</p>
                                    <p>It has therefore become apparent to us that our present
                                        system of control is becoming less and less effective and
                                        that any attempt to control Russian trade through the medium
                                        of an export and import control in the United States and in
                                        the associated countries will prove abortive; and that if it
                                        is desirable to continue the supervision and direction of
                                        Russian foreign trade, this can be effected only through the
                                        adoption of some comprehensive scheme for a control by the

                                    <p>The foregoing concerns vitally the future of corporation
                                        known as the “War Trade Board of the United States Russian
                                        Bureau, Inc.,” which was organized with a capital of
                                        $5,000,000 allotted by Executive order from the
                                        appropriation for national security and defense. This
                                        corporation commenced to accomplish, under war conditions
                                        permitting of an effective control, many useful functions in
                                        connection with the plan to render economic aid to Russia by
                                        stimulating and cooperating with private enterprise, and at
                                        the same time controlling and directing exports to Russia.
                                        At the time of its incorporation, the need for such an
                                        organization was apparent, as the world-wide shortage of
                                        many commodities and the scarcity of ocean transportation,
                                        together with conflicting interests of various governmental
                                        departments, created such a situation that economic
                                        assistance could be effected only through the medium of a
                                        company which was authorized to engage in trade, and which
                                        at the same time operated under government auspices. The
                                        relaxation of the export and import control, particularly
                                        with respect to the countries adjoining Russia, and the
                                        general improvement of the tonnage situation and the
                                        consequent probability that uncontrolled private trade with
                                        Russia will soon revive on a considerable scale, have all
                                        placed this corporation in an anomalous position, because
                                        the company has become, or will soon become, a competitor of
                                        American and foreign private capital without at the same
                                        time being able to effect a proper control of Russian trade
                                        which was one of the primary reasons for its existence. It
                                        is quite likely that such competition unaccompanied by the
                                        accomplishment of the original purpose of controlling
                                        Russian trade for the benefit of the Russian people will be
                                        resented both by the public and by the commercial interests
                                        and governments of friendly countries.</p>
                                    <p>Until further developments, the Russian Bureau, Inc., will
                                        continue to perform such useful functions as will assist the
                                        Russian situation, at the same time incurring no obligations
                                        which can not be fully discharged upon the dissolution of
                                        the War Trade Board, or be properly accomplished through the
                                        permanent governmental departments. The corporation will
                                        continue its organizations here and in Russia so that they
                                        may be prepared to be the nucleus of an organization to
                                        carry out a more comprehensive inter-Allied program, should
                                        it be desirable to utilize the company for this purpose.</p>

                                the Russian Embassy at Washington, that certain further consignments

                                explained that this decision has been taken not because the Embassy
                                is unwilling to help, but out of deference for the principle of
                                leaving consistent activities as far as possible entirely in Russian

                            <p>On January 28 the American Minister at Peking telegraphed that the
                                Chinese Government had prohibited all exports from Manchuria into
                                Siberia. He thought it probable, however, that exception would be
                                made in favor of merchandise in transit to Vladivostok for
                                export.</p>
                            <p>On February 2 the Department instructed the American Minister at
                                Peking that the American Government could not assent to the
                                prohibition of the export to Siberia of merchandise owned by
                                Americans. He was instructed so to inform the Foreign Office and say
                                that in the opinion of this Government any embargo, particularly at
                                this <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0224"/>time, on exports to
                                Siberia was inadvisable and his attention was called to the attitude

                            <p>2047. Your 2321, February 2, 9 p.m. Department now informed embargo
                                by Chinese placed at instance British Minister at Peking. We have
                                informed Chinese Government that the American Government can not
                                assent to the prohibition of the export to Siberia of merchandise
                                owned by Americans and that in our opinion any embargo on exports to
                                Siberia, particularly at this time, is inadvisable. The Department
                                has further advised both British and French Governments that, for
                                the present, we feel it is important an impression should not be
                                created in the minds of the Russian people that they are being
                                abandoned by the Allies or the United States and that consequently
                                we are permitting to go forward, both via Kola and via the Pacific,
                                all supplies, other than munitions, for which tonnage can be found.
                                These supplies now include railway material, agricultural machinery,
                                binder twine, shoes and leather, and Red Cross and other supplies
                                for civilian population. Attitude of this Government towards Russia
                                defined by President’s address to Congress. Two ships now loading at
                                Pacific port, another at New York for Kola.</p>

                                any way exports of foodstuffs to districts in Siberia where urgently
                                needed to relieve distress. It has no objection, however, to
                                consular officers assuring themselves that American merchandise so
                                exported has no enemy destination, that is, will not be reexported
                                to Germany or Austria or reach agents of either of those
                                Governments. Possibly situation would be helped if exports to
                                Siberia could be consigned to responsible local authorities for
                                distribution in districts needing relief.</p>

                                embargo matter. The Chinese Government feels embargo is a great
                                detriment but will maintain it for the sake of Allies while they
                                insist. The British and French Governments continue to insist on
                                embargo, Russian Minister believing that export of foodstuffs to
                                regions east of Irkutsk not dangerous but desirable.</p>

                            <p>Please say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that information
                                received by the American Government is to the effect that the
                                embargo enforced by China on shipments to eastern Siberia is causing
                                hardship to the people of that region whose resentment is directed
                                against the Allies, The American Minister at Peking reports that <pb
                                    n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0227"/>the Russian Minister there
                                believes that the export of foodstuffs to regions east of Irkutsk is
                                desirable and would not be dangerous.</p>
                            <p>The American Government is informed that the embargo serves no useful
                                purpose since supplies from eastern Siberia can not reach Germany.
                                The American Government therefore believes it advisable that the
                                embargo be removed and is disposed to think that China would be glad
                                to remove it if so advised by the Allied Governments.</p>
                            <p>The American Government will be glad to know that the Government to
                                which you are accredited is disposed to instruct its representative
                                at Peking in this sense.</p>

                            <p>10082. I communicated to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1"
                                    >Balfour</persName> your 7529, May 7 [1], 8 p.m., regarding
                                embargo on exports of foodstuffs from China to Russia. He states
                                that in February last embargo was relaxed in such a way as to permit
                                passage of foodstuffs from Harbin eastward to Vladivostok and
                                western Russia to Irkutsk upon certificates from Allied Consuls. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> is not quite
                                clear from reports received whether dispatch of foodstuffs westward
                                was permitted to districts between the Manchurian frontier and
                                Irkutsk or only to Irkutsk itself. There seems to be no reason why
                                foodstuffs should not be sent to parts of Siberia east of Irkutsk as
                                promptly as possible. British Minister at Peking has been
                                telegraphed on the subject and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1"
                                    >Balfour</persName> promises definite answer upon receipt of his

                            <p>Chinese Eastern asking if embargo at Manchuria Station can not be
                                raised at once enough to enable it to supply their workers who are

                                they have a feeling that in keeping embargo the Allies are not

                                presentation to him of this matter he consulted the French Minister
                                at Peking regarding the possibility of carrying out our Government’s
                                suggestion inasmuch as it seemed advisable to ascertain what effects
                                might result therefrom in regard to the re victualing of [eastern?]
                                Siberia where the enemy daily gains ground thanks to Bolshevik help
                                and that of German and Hungarian [prisoners?]</p>
                            <p><persName>M. Pichon</persName> writes me at present largely expedient
                                to maintain as a whole the embargo in [force?] by Chinese Government
                                though it might be possible to attenuate its rigor in a certain
                                measure by granting export authorizations in such cases where
                                exportations can be watched and guaranteed. The Minister believes
                                that this solution would be the best to insure the desired
                                protection and hopes that the Federal Government will thus

                                French Government still believes embargo should be maintained,
                                though its rigors may be attenuated by granting export
                                authorizations in cases where exportations can be watched and
                                guaranteed. French Government believes that this plan offers best

                            <p>Embassy at London telegraphed on May 28 that British Government
                                concurs in proposal to raise embargo on supplies which are not in
                                danger of reaching the enemy. British Government has communicated
                                these views to French Government.</p>
                            <p>American Government has been opposed from the beginning to the
                                embargo and it does not believe that specific shipments of

                                Chinese Government is prepared to accede if such action is deemed

                                Minister expresses the hope in view of new situation created by the

                                Irkutsk our Government may consider it advisable to modify the

                            <p>Your telegram of July 5, 5 p.m. In view of the complete control of
                                Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk by Bolshevik and enemy forces, the
                                British Government has instructed Legation to urge upon the Chinese
                                Government the necessity of prohibiting the passage of supplies
                                thither by Sungari River. This appears to be a particular measure of
                                military necessity, as distinguished from general embargo, and I beg
                                to request authorization to support British representatives if
                                necessary.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: This morning at a
                                meeting of the Council of National Defense, Mr. <persName>Stanley
                                    Washburn</persName> made an address in which he urged the
                                importance of the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Russia and likewise
                                urged the importance of Russia in the European war. He suggested
                                that the sending of some expert railroad operators from America to
                                Russia would be an effective aid to that country’s transportation
                                system and would be accepted by the Government and people of Russia
                                as an evidence of our sympathetic desire to cooperate with them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Daniel Willard</persName>, President
                                of the Advisory Commission,<note n="1" xml:id="d261fn1">Of the
                                    Council of National Defense.</note> warmly supported the idea,
                                and offered to undertake to send to Russia a small group of
                                experienced and competent railroad men to go over this railroad,
                                analyze its needs, and return to this country with a report which
                                would show just what, in material and men, is needed to increase the
                                efficiency of its operation.</p>
                            <p>I suggested that before such a thing were done, the President’s
                                judgment should be taken; and I therefore conferred with the
                                President, and he asks me to request you to send to the American
                                Ambassador at Petrograd the following despatch.</p>

                            <p>5923. I learn from a private and apparently trustworthy source that
                                one of the critical problems of the new Russian Government is the
                                proper management of the Trans-Siberian Railway. It has been
                                suggested to me by a man who knows Russia that American management
                                would greatly help the Russian military situation and prove to be
                                also an invaluable key after the war to industrial development. This
                                seems so important a suggestion looking towards future
                                American-Russian trade that I send it for your investigation if you
                                think wise. I have no first-hand facts.</p>

                            <p>1288. Would the Russian Government welcome an inspection of the

                            <p>1167. Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me by telephone that

                                to learn how Siberian Railway can be made more efficient. Written
                                reply will be received to-morrow when if differs herefrom shall
                                cable again. Am sending this promptly because Russia sorely needs

                                meeting to-day of the representatives of the car manufacturers and
                                of the locomotive manufacturers having orders for the Russian
                                Government. They agreed to give precedence to these offers over any
                                orders for domestic consumption. The railroads have agreed to help
                                in seeing that the manufacturers obtain the raw materials promptly
                                and also in seeing that the orders, when completed, are shipped
                                promptly. It is believed that all possible speed will be given to
                                these orders.</p>

                            <p>1372. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">John F. Stevens</persName> has
                                been requested to head a commission of expert railroad officials
                                which will leave for Russia within the next week via Vladivostok.
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> is perhaps best
                                known by his connection with the early planning and construction in
                                connection with the Panama Canal. The work which he laid out and the
                                plans which he formulated were finally carried through to completion
                                by General Goethals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> has also had extensive experience in the
                                location of railways, notably the Great Northern, which line he
                                located across the Rocky and Cascade ranges. He has superintended
                                the construction also of many other notable pieces of engineering
                                work.</p>
                            <p>The personnel of his party will be made up of men who have had
                                well-recognized experience. This committee is being sent in the hope
                                that it may be able to ascertain ways in which this country can be
                                helpful to Russia during this present great emergency. It is
                                believed that an examination of Russian railroads will disclose
                                methods whereby we will be able to render immediate and valuable
                                assistance. It is not improbable, that with slight changes,
                                equipment now being built for American railroads may be so changed
                                as to fit the Russian gauge and requirements, and it is with that
                                thought now in mind that the commission is being sent.</p>

                            <p>I am sending with the commission on the special train two

                                    >Stevens</persName> and his commission. They are Prof.

                                interpreters and, as cabled you, I preferred to send Americans.
                                Professor <persName>Golder</persName> has been in Petrograd for some
                                months and with your consent has been given access to the records of

                                relations between our Government and Russia. Eugene Prince is
                                thoroughly American in sentiment and tells me he is a citizen of the
                                United States by special act of Congress. He is a mechanician and
                                has devoted considerable time to the construction and laying out of
                                railroads.</p>
                            <p>I have written Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> in
                                detail concerning these men. I am also sending to Vladivostok to

                                    Riggs</persName>, with instructions to impress upon Mr.

                                    >Nekrasov</persName> is that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"

                                Vladivostok terminals. In order to make that control effective, he
                                must exercise authority over all trains entering Vladivostok yards
                                and I hope that in time <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0241"/>and

                            <p>1510. Railway commission says important that locomotive erection
                                plant be immediately established at Vladivostok and so recommended
                                on arrival to Minister, Ways of Communication, who approved and is
                                now constructing building therefor, leaving plant [to be?] operated
                                by locomotive manufacturers. Minister, Ways of Communication, now
                                states is informed communications from America that locomotive
                                manufacturers there insist on only making sales of locomotives for
                                delivery at their shops. Most expeditious method is for
                                manufacturers to equip and operate erecting plant at Vladivostok and
                                railway commission understood on leaving America that it was so
                                agreed, in fact it was suggested by locomotive manufacturers. This
                                plan should be followed, but if impossible then military unit of
                                skilled mechanics should be sent with equipment to operate plant.
                                Russia will furnish ample electric power and water from adjoining
                                naval plant. Prompt action required. Please adopt most expeditious

                                be done pending arrival committee units. Arrange to send 12 units of
                                14 men, each unit to consist of 1 division superintendent, 1 master
                                mechanic, 1 chief train dispatcher, 2 train masters, 2 traveling
                                engineers, 6 train dispatchers and 1 line repairer. One division
                                superintendent at least should be thoroughly experienced in terminal
                                work. Ten units to be located at towns between Vladivostok and Omsk,
                                two Petrograd to Moscow. Master mechanic should be experienced
                                roundhouse foreman capable keeping up running repairs with poor
                                engine-terminal facilities. Also following foremen: 10 (omission),
                                10 foundry, 10 boiler, 10 machine, 10 engine-erecting, 5
                                car-erecting, 5 paint, 20 roundhouse. Minister suggests some men
                                speaking Russian or French can be gotten on American roads capable
                                filling lower ranks. Also 2 general superintendents having practical
                                experience in train work to rank as majors. All above force to be
                                organized as United States military unit skeleton engineer regiment.
                                Suggest division superintendent[s] rank as captains, balance lower
                                grade. Should have quartermasters to handle food and quarters. Also
                                ingenious shop superintendent skilled in rearranging antiquated
                                shops having electric power line driven shafts, speed up to-day
                                machinery and output without stopping work. He should be made a
                                member of this commission. Also first-class man to direct
                                installation telephone, train dispatching and electric locking
                                block-signal circuits. Order 1,000 selector phones and bring along
                                as many and other essential appliances as can be had quickly. Can
                                probably adapt present iron wires. Care in selecting men of patience
                                and policy necessary. All to act as instructors to educate Russians
                                in American methods returning to United States thereafter, time
                                depending largely upon duration of war. Expense of all this,
                                excepting general superintendent, to be Russian through credit of
                                United States. While we begin at once to try and improve things, not
                                much can be effected before arrival American units so hurry them
                                along. There has been a great change recently in official spirit
                                here, now apparently enthusiastic for American methods which we must
                                make successful.</p>

                                <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0247"/>that it is important that
                                the impression should not be created that he and his associates
                                represent or speak for the Government of the United States. As the
                                President explained to the commission before they started, they were
                                sent abroad merely to put themselves at the service of the Russian
                                Government. Any assurances conveyed to the Russian people,
                                therefore, as if authoritatively by the commission would be a very
                                grave mistake. The President does not wish in this way to discredit
                                assurances already given but merely to convey a very friendly
                                caution for the future.</p>

                                like Howard Elliott with a few competent subordinate experts to
                                advise concerning operation of lines other than Siberian and

                                Russian Ambassador, dated November 6, 1917, stating that the
                                schedule of the proposed delivery of 1,500 locomotives for the
                                Russian Government, which I enclose herewith,<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d308fn1">Not printed.</note> requires your approval
                                before it can be put in operation. For your information I am also
                                enclosing a copy of the Ambassador’s note.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d308fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                            <p>I have no hesitation in urging that every possible support be given
                                to Russia. At the same time I hope you will agree that no contract
                                for delivery of railroad material, whether locomotives or cars,
                                should be made with Russia, which does not stipulate that the
                                duration of the agreement is contingent upon Russia’s continuing
                                active in support of the war against Germany.</p>
                            <p>A recent telegram from the Ambassador at Petrograd, copy of which you
                                have already seen, also suggests the possibility that Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> may modify his previous
                                recommendations upon which the pending schedule is based. The
                                Department has cabled the Ambassador for an urgent decision one way
                                or the other. It consequently seems to me that any final approval of

                            <p>Your telegram December 28, 5 p.m., was not received. I did not
                                telegraph reasons for railway corps’ going Japan because <persName

                                it. Corps went to Japan because it is impossible accomplish anything
                                on railway. There are no accommodations on shore here for corps and
                                ice made detention transport precarious. Useless for corps to come
                                until some authority can be maintained either by Russia or Allies.
                                At present soldiers dictate train movements holding expresses behind
                                troop trains for days, detaching engines from expresses, and
                                crowding on guard trains without paying. Moreover, although railway
                                employees mostly well inclined, continued working of railway is
                                uncertain because funds are not forthcoming from Petrograd.

                                Undesirable interpreters must be discharged in Japan before corps

                                should proceed alone at once to Vladivostok to investigate

                                prospect of going ahead with work. Party can not be held
                                indefinitely idle as services urgently needed both here and in
                                France. On the other hand project should not be abandoned until you
                                and <persName corresp="#p_ECH1">Colonel Emerson</persName> are
                                convinced of expediency to do so.</p>
                            <p>Department’s advices further confirm your own impressions that the
                                people are and will be in control for some time. Your dealings <pb

                                and not with the machinery of a well-established government.
                                Department will regard your conclusions as based on your judgment
                                that party will be able to cope successfully with these conditions.
                                Department concurs in Ambassador’s views as to value of work both
                                for present and future and will support you. If whole party can not
                                be profitably employed please consider whether a part of them should
                                remain. Within last few weeks Red Cross has brought two trains
                                through from Archangel to Jassy. Keep me advised your movements.</p>

                                Harbin. Bolsheviks control all Siberian towns east from Irkutsk but
                                railway employees and vast majority population, helpless in their
                                grasp, hate them. We can work with these.</p>
                            <p>I have opposed raising Allied forces Harbin for invasion against
                                Bolsheviks and also Allied money and arms for Russian force under
                                Russian control because of Russian disorganization and inefficiency,
                                but the certainty now clear that Siberia and railways will fall
                                completely into hands of the German war prisoners and the Bolsheviks
                                unless immediate measures taken renders action imperative. It is
                                reported that armed German prisoners now acting as guards in some
                                Siberian towns. Firmly believe unless America takes over direction

                                figureheads, will you accept and support with money and arms Russian

                                supervision to guard Siberian railways? This will involve Russian
                                relief [rescue?] of Amur River railway also from the Bolsheviks’ and
                                prisoners’ control and may extend to western Siberia. Chinese troops
                                would be retained guarding Manchurian railway as their share in
                                Allies’ cooperation. Russians have also excellent nucleus in Cossack
                                force now operating between Manchouli and Irkutsk, but lack money

                                Siberia and fears further German influence. He is convinced that
                                railroad contingent can be very helpful in organizing <pb n="221"

                                Trans-Siberian Railway as far as Irkutsk. He hopes Department will
                                authorize him to proceed. He believes that if contingent should be
                                recalled it would greatly discourage the Russian people as
                                indicating intention of United States to abandon them. He states
                                that Chinese Eastern is well policed by Chinese troops. He thinks
                                any form of military occupation or intervention at this time would
                                be unwarranted but suggests that a small force of loyal Russian
                                soldiers might be easily organized and equipped to police
                                Trans-Siberian Railway from Manchouli to Irkutsk provided funds
                                could be obtained for them. Some such force, he believes, will be
                                required to maintain order and to check growing German
                                influence.</p>

                                concerning railway men, certainly government would be [ready to?]

                                request they be sent Vologda where could not arrive before April 15.

                            <p>73. Answering your 42, April 2, 7 p.m. Soviet government has not
                                specifically defined uses for railway men, which was my reason <pb

                                sent here for conference with myself and experienced Russian
                                railroad official; Soviet government requested they be sent Moscow.
                                Transportation conditions deplorable and require improvement, which
                                we can best render having demonstrated our ability therefor by
                                bettering Soviet government service. If Germans advance, which
                                extremely probable, improved transportation required to protect
                                Allied interests by evacuation supplies from threatened sections.
                                Yesterday’s conference of Allied Ambassadors and Military Attachés
                                much pleased when informed railway men <hi rend="italic">en

                                protect commission in operation thereof. Furthermore, in event of
                                Allied intervention from east or west or both, railroad efficiency
                                is essential. Has Department countermanded railway men’s coming?</p>

                                Soviet government when asked explanation of supplies being hurriedly
                                shipped from Archangel against British protest and how Soviet
                                government reconciled such action to repudiation of loans, replied
                                munitions from Archangel are sent Moscow, the Urals and Siberian
                                towns, and Soviet government expects to pay therefor in raw
                                materials, but asks for time to organize economic resources of
                                Russia and states that Soviet government is evacuating all war
                                material from [Petrograd?] into interior and asks “Who can seriously
                                think that government whose best soldiers have fought against German
                                control in Ukraine and Finland can now be planning to furnish
                                Germany with power to enslave their own land?” Do not understand
                                that I accept absolutely such assurances as does <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RL1">Robins</persName>, to whom they were made, but
                                at the same time Soviet government interests clearly demand German
                                resistance, as German domination spells overthrow of Bolshevism in
                                Russia. I appreciate fully mistakes of Soviet government and
                                outrages practiced as reported by <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                    >Summers</persName> and consuls, but think best plan is to
                                ignore same for the present in order to induce Soviet government to
                                ask Allied assistance, so that when Allies enter Russia, will not
                                meet with Soviet government’s refusal, but Soviet government’s
                                welcome. To this end I recommend sending railway men to Vologda.</p>

                            <p>Decision to send <persName corresp="#p_ECH1">Emerson</persName> and
                                men to advise with Soviet European Russia places us in very
                                embarrassing position. The new administration Chinese Eastern are
                                bitterly anti-Soviet. My opinion is that principal object of its
                                reorganization is to provide stronger means for fighting Soviet,
                                even by force of arms. We are thus placed in impossible situation of
                                trying to help two bitterly opposing [factions?] with the usual
                                result facing us [of] antagonizing both. To retire now from Chinese
                                Eastern, which I apprehend we will be told to do when Vologda
                                movement becomes known, will be to play directly into hands of
                                Japan, which is opposing us all the time undoubtedly with the view
                                of controlling entire transportation systems of Manchuria. I should
                                have quick and ample instructions as I regard the situation as
                                extremely delicate.</p>

                            <p>Your two telegrams April 29, 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Sending engineers to
                                Russia has sole purpose to ascertain how we can assist further in
                                measures against Germany. Military attaché at Vologda reports:

                            <p>This government does not wish to refuse considering possibility of
                                definite measures against Germany and on that account it is
                                essential to ascertain whether any of the men under your orders can
                                be used in different parts of Russia. Explain this clearly to new
                                administration of Chinese Eastern Railway at earliest possible
                                opportunity. From your telegram quick action would seem to be
                                necessary. This Government does not recognize Bolshevik authorities
                                and has no official relations with them. Keep Department advised.
                                Why could not men at Nagasaki be organized for service as separate
                                contingent in European Russia?</p>

                                must be done through some head authority as otherwise brutal
                                contempt by ignorant local committees will nullify all attempts to

                            <p>I had talk Vladivostok with special commissioner sent from Soviet,
                                Moscow. Claims that he has full authority of all government
                                property. He is ignorant [omission?]. Is very sore because United
                                States does not recognize his government. I told him I could not
                                discuss such matters. Complains because we are on Chinese Eastern. I
                                told him we knew no factions, our aim only as Ally to induce Russia
                                to resume war against Germany, which statement did not evoke great
                                applause. Said that any request to help railways must come directly
                                from Moscow not from outside committees apparently fishing for
                                recognition. I told him if such a request should be made it would be
                                considered, but I made no commitments. Am I to understand <persName

                                Ambassador’s instructions—if so I must be relieved of all the
                                responsibility thereof. Chinese Eastern much agitated [by] <persName

                                latter being something that would be beyond my capacity. It is
                                evident Soviet is fast losing confidence of its only support, the
                                ignorant masses, and is looking for some one to help let go the
                                bear’s tail.</p>

                                with Bolshevik authorities. They were, as a matter of fact, ordered
                                to confer with you as to what, if anything, could be done by the
                                Russian Railway Service Corps in European Russia, no action to be
                                taken, however, without Department’s approval. Department has had it
                                in mind that developments might permit of sending the 80 men now
                                detained at Nagasaki to European Russia and that they might
                                ultimately succeed in working eastwards and meeting the men under

                                westwards. However, the Embassy at Tokyo and <persName

                                Department that there has been considerable propaganda in eastern
                                Siberia to the effect that <persName corresp="#p_ECH1"
                                    >Emerson</persName>’s visit to you really meant that this
                                Government had a secret arrangement with the Bolsheviks for
                                America’s control of the Siberian Railway. <persName

                                you will appreciate the delicacy with which your actions in Russia
                                must be conducted. The Department understands the Bolsheviks are
                                exceedingly anxious for recognition and will enlarge upon any
                                opportunity to put their own interpretation upon your actions.
                                Possibly this can not be avoided altogether, nevertheless, it must
                                not be allowed to assume such proportions as to alienate the
                                sympathy and confidence of those liberal elements of Russian opinion
                                which do not support Bolsheviki.</p>

                                than at short range you can perhaps realize. Railway improvement is
                                essential for all real help to Russia. No other American has your
                                intimate knowledge of Russian railways. Department will keep you

                            <p>113. Following from <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                >Stevens</persName>:</p>
                            <p>About 18,000 Japanese troops disembarked Vladivostok already. Six
                                thousand additional moved by way of Changchun to Manchouli front.
                                Japanese dominating everything possible, are making effort control
                                operation railways, will succeed unless the United States takes firm
                                stand. Railways should be at once taken under military control and
                                operation be placed in hands my commission and Russian Railway
                                Service Corps. Russian operation is merely a joke. We can increase
                                efficiency 100 per cent. Under Russian or Japanese management
                                military operation will be hampered. Useless to try to mix American
                                and Japanese management. Our military men here thoroughly approve
                                operation railroads under our direction. If Japanese operation is
                                permitted all our railway men should be sent home. After my long
                                time of waiting by reason of Department order I am surely entitled
                                to be given an opportunity to handle the railway situation. If I can
                                not be, my usefulness over here is at an end. Giving advice to
                                Russians is a farce, especially with Japanese influences
                                predominating . . . . Situation is critical and should be promptly
                                met by the United States. Answer quick in care of Consul,
                                Harbin.</p>

                            <p>Information coming to the Department indicates that the Japanese
                                Government intends to make a proposal to the Chinese <pb n="240"
                                    xml:id="pg_240" facs="0290"/>Eastern Railway Co. to change the
                                gauge on the Chinese Eastern Railroad to conform to the gauge on the
                                South Manchuria Railroad. It seems very inadvisable that this be
                                done because a change in the gauge of any part of the Trans-Siberian
                                system would render physically impossible transportation over that
                                part of the system of rolling stock belonging to the system. Further
                                it would tend to disrupt the system.</p>
                            <p>It has been suggested that the members of the <persName

                                commissioned in the United States Army. This Government is opposed
                                to the incorporation with the American armed forces of this civilian
                                commission which was sent to Siberia to serve the best interests of
                                the Russian people. The members of these railroad units are the
                                agents of Russian people and are being paid and supported by their
                                Ambassador here from funds belonging to them, and it is felt that
                                further complications would not arise and best results would be had
                                if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> for and in
                                behalf of the Russian people were to have general direction of the
                                Trans-Siberian and the Chinese Eastern Railways and their several
                                branches. In so far as is concerned that part of the Chinese Eastern
                                which lies within Chinese territory some member of the commission
                                chosen by the Chinese Government in consultation with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> should have the management
                                in coordination with other members of the commission on other

                                say to the Japanese Foreign Office that the American Government has
                                no desire to impugn the motives of the Japanese Government in
                                sending troops to Manchouli; that the preservation of Russian
                                interests and the success of the expedition in aid of the Czechs are
                                primary considerations of this Government and that this Government
                                will be glad to have the cooperation of the Imperial Japanese
                                Government to the end that the railways be operated by the engineers
                                chosen by the last recognized Government of Russia and to further
                                the efforts of those engineers to take charge, put the lines in as
                                good working order as possible and operate them during the military
                                occupation subject to the requirements of the military forces.</p>

                            <p>I to-day conveyed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs the proposals in
                                reference to the Siberian railways as contained in your telegram of
                                August 30, 4 p.m., and at his request I left with him a memorandum
                                containing the substance of those proposals.</p>
                            <p>He replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KY1">Kinoshita</persName>,
                                one of the officials of the Imperial railways, had gone to Siberia
                                to investigate conditions and was in cordial relations with Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>; that he had been
                                carefully considering how our Governments might cooperate in
                                improving the transportation conditions, but that there were two
                                difficulties.</p>
                            <p>In the first place he understood that the Allied miliary council at
                                Vladivostok had decided to take over the railways as far as possible
                                in the interest of the military operations and that at least for the
                                present the plan suggested might conflict with these military plans,
                                and in the second place he feared that the Allied Governments
                                represented at Vladivostok might not look with favor on a plan which
                                placed the railways under such control.</p>
                            <p>In reply to the first objection I pointed out that the military
                                authorities had no adequate force to operate properly such a system
                                    <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0292"/>and I was under the
                                impression that after discussion they had decided not to attempt it.
                                He thought I was misinformed but later sent a representative to
                                advise me that my impression was correct. In reply to the second
                                objection I emphasized the fact that <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> and his associates were not the
                                representatives of any outside power but the paid agents of the
                                Russian people. He then stated that his Government would give
                                immediate consideration to the proposals and when I urged prompt
                                action in the interest of all the Allied activities in Russia, where
                                the need for adequate transportation was pressing, he replied that
                                it would be necessary to consult <persName corresp="#p_OG1">General
                                    Otani</persName>, which might take several days.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the conversation I took occasion to explain the
                                attitude of our Government including [concerning?] their Manchouli
                                expedition. He seemed disappointed that my statement was limited to
                                the Manchouli expedition and said that he was anxiously waiting for
                                some indication of the attitude of our Government toward the
                                proposed dispatch of troops to Vladivostok and Karymskaya.</p>
                            <p>He then called my attention to the recent appointment of Siberian
                                commissioners by France and Great Britain and explained that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Matsudaira</persName> was in no sense
                                a commissioner but merely attached to the staff of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_OG1">General Otani</persName>. He stated further
                                that both France and Great Britain were urging the Japanese
                                Government to appoint a commissioner. He felt that this was an
                                important question and involved the larger question of intervention
                                which still remained undecided. He has directed <persName
                                    corresp="#p_IK1">Ishii</persName> to ascertain how our
                                Government viewed this question and he hoped I would advise you of
                                the importance he attached to it.</p>

                                its functions as a trust of America with due regard for the rights
                                of all parties in interest, including China. I beg to request that I
                                be authorized, in my discretion, to give a formal assurance to that
                                effect in your name.</p>
                            <p>In reply to his inquiry I stated that while I only knew positively
                                that the American proposal was thoroughly discussed with Japan, I
                                    <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0294"/>presumed that it was
                                likewise being discussed with all other Allied Governments concerned
                                in the expedition in aid of the Czechs. It would be an assistance to
                                me in urging our proposals if I were informed of the progress of
                                negotiations with the other Allies.</p>
                            <p>To his inquiry whether the Russo-Asiatic Bank, which is the holder of
                                the railway company, were being consulted, I replied that I had no
                                information but was inclined to think that our Government looked
                                only to the known fact that this nominally private railway
                                enterprise had always in reality been an institution of the Russian
                                Ministry of Finance and that under the existing military necessity
                                the claims of the concessionaires would doubtless be left for
                                subsequent adjustment. I venture to suggest that in order to
                                forestall the opposition of this influential Franco-Russian banking
                                organization it might be advisable to convey through the French and
                                Russian Ambassadors in Washington some such assurance as would allay
                                any apprehensions that its property rights would be prejudiced by
                                our proposal.</p>
                            <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs inquired whether the Civil Governor of
                                Kirin Province, who is acting Chinese president of railway under the
                                terms of concession contract of 1896, would be acceptable (as one?)
                                of the Chinese members of the commission under <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>. I remarked that the
                                American commissioners were all technical railway experts and that
                                it was to be hoped that China would be able to offer for service on
                                the commission some of the most capable Chinese railway agents but
                                that the acceptability of any particular person would be a matter
                                for subsequent decision in consultation with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>. In view of the legal
                                relationship of the Chinese Government to the railway and
                                considering the political embarrassment which might be involved in
                                its having to withdraw too [complete]ly from its present nominal
                                participation in the control of the railway, I beg to suggest that
                                our proposal [would] appear much more favorably to it, if I were
                                authorized to state that the governor operate [exercising?]
                                political functions designated by this Government would be welcomed
                                as a member of the commission, perhaps with some title such as
                                Special Commissioner for the Chinese Eastern Railway.</p>
                            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared to be very favorably impressed
                                by your proposals and promised to urge upon the Cabinet as
                                presenting a solution advantageous alike to China and to the Allies.
                                It is, however, to be feared that the decision of this Government
                                will be much influenced by the Minister of Communication, Tsao, who
                                for reasons known to the Department is likely to adopt whatever
                                attitude is indicated to him as most consonant with the policy of
                                the Japanese Government. The following telegram is repeated from

                                    <p>33, September 4. Kindly advise me who is to have control of
                                        the Siberian Railway during the time the Allies are
                                        operating in Siberia and Russia. I have sounded government
                                        officials and people in every part of Siberia and all are in
                                        favor of placing the control and management in the hands of
                                        America. Czech commanders insist upon doing this, claiming
                                        that it is a military necessity that Americans take over
                                        control of the railroad. An attempt to favor Japan in this
                                        respect would be immediately resented by both Siberians and
                                        Czechs and it would be a bad diplomatic move. I strongly
                                        urge that the railway be placed in charge of the <persName
                                            corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> railway commission
                                        which must be in the position to assume active management at
                                        once.</p>
                                    <p>Please bring my views to the attention of Department and the
                                            <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> railway
                                        commission and I urge that all measures permissible be taken
                                        to block any ulterior motives which Japan may have on the
                                        railway as being inimical to Allied interests in Siberia.
                                        Russian people will oppose it by all means in their
                                        (possession?).</p>

                                contents orally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. [He has]
                                replied that he this morning received practically the same advices
                                from Viscount <persName corresp="#p_IK1">Ishii</persName> who had
                                reported fully a conversation with you upon the same subject. He was
                                at a loss to account for the report that such an order had been
                                issued by the Japanese General at Vladivostok, denied all knowledge
                                of it, could not credit it, and thought it must be due to some
                                misunderstanding. He offered as an explanation the familiar
                                suggestion that the report arose through mistranslation. It might be
                                that Japanese troops had taken over the protection of the railways
                                or some portion of them and that an order to this effect had been so
                                translated as to indicate control of operation. He had this morning
                                telegraphed to Vladivostok to ascertain the facts and hoped an
                                answer some time to-morrow when he would promptly advise me. Until
                                he received the answer there was nothing more he could say.</p>
                            <p>… Recent events seem to support the statement constantly repeated
                                that the General Staff has a definite policy in Siberia and that it
                                proposes to pursue this policy leaving to the Foreign Office and
                                Viscount <persName corresp="#p_IK1">Ishii</persName> the task of
                                explaining after the event. I say this <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246"

                            <p>Your September 3, 12 p.m. Department’s August 30, 4 p.m.,
                                contemplated that <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> as
                                official adviser of the Russian Ministry of Ways of Communication
                                should, with the assistance of the Russian Railway Service Corps
                                composed of American railway engineers, in the service of Russia
                                undertake the effective working of the railways in cooperation with
                                Russian officials and personnel. As the Department sees it, three
                                distinct questions arise, namely: (1) legal; (2) military; (3)
                                actual railway operation.</p>
                            <p>This Government does not consider that either the Bolshevik movement
                                or the presence of international military assistance in Siberia or
                                in Manchuria modifies the previously existing rights of Russia or
                                China. At the same time, it is evident that, at least for the
                                present, military operations must be facilitated and that the actual
                                movement of trains must be governed accordingly. It is in these
                                premises that the Department urges the actual operation of the
                                Chinese Eastern, as well as other parts of the Siberian Railway and

                                Government, and was confident that no Japanese financial interests
                                had taken such action. He advised me in confidence that some time

                                stating that he had thought much of our conversation last Monday as

                                endeavoring to deprive the Allied military conference at Vladivostok
                                of jurisdiction over the question. If he could accomplish this, our
                                two Governments would then be free to agree upon some mutual
                                plan.</p>

                                This request was refused by the Allied military council but was
                                subsequently reconsidered and the council then agreed that in lieu
                                of the prices requested, the Japanese military forces should advance
                                to the Chinese Eastern Railway Co. 1,000,000 yen which roughly
                                represented the amount which would be due for transportation and
                                freight charges for movement of troops. This decision was promptly
                                carried out by the General Staff and the Foreign Office had no

                                consideration by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs made the suggestion that the matter would be simplified if

                                over control of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Upon my remarking our
                                Government would scarcely look to the head of the railway
                                administration rather than to the Russian Government for
                                authorization for <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> to
                                act, he stated to me in confidence that the Tao Yin of Harbin has
                                reported to the Chinese Government statement made to him by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HGL1">Horvat</persName>, that within the
                                past four or five days “the Japanese” have been strongly urging him
                                to turn over control to them.</p>
                            <p>The Minister showed some anxiety to know what progress had been made
                                in the negotiations with other Allies. To my question whether the
                                Japanese Government had given the Chinese any indication of its
                                attitude toward the project he answered that it had not, unless some
                                such indication were to be inferred from a telegram received from
                                the Chinese Minister at Tokyo inquiring whether the proposal had
                                been suggested to the American Government by China.</p>

                            <p>1337. The American Ambassador at Tokyo has been instructed to suggest
                                to the Japanese Government and also to inform fully his colleagues
                                representing the Governments of the Allies, the opinion of this
                                Government that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">John F.
                                    Stevens</persName>, chairman of the Railway Advisory Commission
                                to Russia and official advisor of the Russian Ministry of Ways of
                                Communication, should undertake the effective operation of the
                                different sections of the Trans-Siberian Railway and its branches,
                                with the assistance of the American engineers in the service of
                                Russia, known as the Russian Railway Service Corps, in conjunction
                                with Russian railway officials and personnel and in cooperation with
                                the Allies. In making such a suggestion the Government of the United
                                States is simply carrying out its original purpose to assist the
                                Russian people in the vital matter of transportation when it sent a
                                railway advisory commission to Russia in June 1917 and, at the
                                request of the Provisional Government of Russia, organized the
                                Russian Railway Service Corps in September 1917. It does not
                                consider that either the Bolshevik movement or the presence of
                                international military assistance in Siberia or in Manchuria has
                                modified the previously existing rights of Russia or of China. At
                                the same time it is evident that, at least for the present, military
                                operations must be facilitated and that the actual movement of
                                trains must be governed accordingly.</p>
                            <p>As so much time has intervened since this Government’s first step was
                                taken to help Russia through improvement of railway transportation,
                                    <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0300"/>it seems necessary, and
                                indeed essential, to recall certain facts. One of the first problems
                                which confronted the Provisional Government of Russia after the
                                revolution of March 1917, was the improvement of the food supply.
                                The revolution had been precipitated by the demand of the people on
                                the streets of Petrograd for food. After a temporary improvement,
                                however, the situation after the revolution began to grow worse than
                                it had been before. It was generally agreed that the total supplies
                                of food in the country were adequate for the population but that the
                                machinery of distribution was collapsing.</p>
                            <p>This disheartening condition was due primarily to the railways. The
                                situation was brought to the attention of this Government by the
                                American Ambassador at Petrograd and was further enlarged upon
                                informally and unofficially by Mr. <persName>Stanley
                                    Washburn</persName>, now Major in the United States Army, upon
                                his return from Russia in the spring of 1917. During the spring and
                                summer of that year it is also understood that both the British and
                                French Governments were agreed upon the seriousness of the railway
                                situation and the assistance which might come from America owing to
                                the close parallel between general railway problems in America and
                                in Russia where, in both countries, questions of long haul were the
                                rule and not the exception.</p>
                            <p>The establishment of democratic principles in Russia had been
                                welcomed by this Government and by the people of the United States.
                                It was felt that a first step in bringing the prevailing sentiment
                                of sympathy for Russia to some concrete expression might well take
                                the form of helping the Russian people improve their railway
                                systems, especially that system of connecting lines known as the
                                Trans-Siberian Railway.</p>
                            <p>After serious reflection and deliberation, the President, with the
                                knowledge and approval of the Provisional Government of Russia,
                                determined to send a railway advisory commission of five experts of
                                the first rank who should study, first of all, the Trans-Siberian
                                system, and prepare themselves to offer such advice and counsel as
                                the railway administration of Russia might express a wish to
                                receive.</p>
                            <p>The commission, consisting of Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName>, <persName>Darling</persName>,
                                    <persName>Greiner</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MW1"
                                    >Gibbs</persName>, and <persName>Miller</persName>, arrived at
                                Vladivostok the first part of June 1917 and, after a brief
                                inspection of the enormous quantities of accumulated munitions and
                                other material at that port, proceeded across Siberia in a special
                                train provided by the Russian railway administration and made a
                                sound survey of conditions as they passed. They were then put in
                                touch with the Minister of Ways of Communication and his assistants
                                at Petrograd. At the request of the Minister, they not only informed
                                him fully as to their recommendations in <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251"
                                    facs="0301"/>regard to the Trans-Siberian Railway but also
                                undertook to inspect conditions in the Donets Basin and report on
                                the railways to Archangel and Murmansk. As they completed their
                                special studies, the members of the commission in turn came back to
                                the United States with the exception of Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>; he remained and was
                                established in the Ministry of Ways of Communication in the capacity
                                of special advisor, in the expectation that he might assist in
                                carrying into actual operation the measures which the commission had
                                agreed with Russian officials were vital.</p>
                            <p>It was at this time that the Provisional Government of Russia
                                requested that a corps of American railway engineers, organized to
                                constitute skeleton division units as known in this country, should
                                be formed here and enter the service of the Provisional Government
                                of Russia. The plan was to establish these engineers in an advisory
                                capacity along the different sections of the Trans-Siberian line.
                                Upon entering the service of the Provisional Government, that
                                Government undertook to meet all expenses of maintenance and
                                subsistence of the men of whatever character. The Russian Railway
                                Service Corps was thereupon organized by selecting picked engineers
                                from different American railways and left the United States the 1st
                                of November 1917.</p>
                            <p>The Bolshevik revolution having occurred while they were in transit
                                to Vladivostok, they were unable to enter at once upon their duties.
                                At the request of the Russian Ambassador at Washington they were
                                therefore retained in Japan until an opportunity appeared for them
                                to make a start. This opportunity came in March 1918, when about 110
                                of these engineers were sent to the Chinese Eastern Railway,
                                operating from Harbin as a base; the balance, consisting of about 90
                                men, were recently sent to Vladivostok.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> is not only one of
                                the leading railway engineers of the United States but also proved
                                his high capacity in the earlier stages of the building of the
                                Panama Canal. He has now been more than a year in Russia during
                                which time he has been a constant student of Russian railway
                                problems and conditions. The majority of the engineers under him
                                have obtained some experience of actual operation and some of his
                                subordinates have established contact with the personnel of the
                                Trans-Baikal and Tomsk Railways and the sections of the
                                Trans-Siberian line further west in Siberia and European Russia.
                                Both he and his colleagues undertook their responsibilities with a
                                clear sense of duty. They will continue their work in the same
                                spirit.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States believes it necessary and a part
                                of frank understanding with the Allied Governments and the <pb

                                definitely and without any reservations whatsoever that it disclaims
                                all purpose to obtain any interest or control in the railways of
                                Russia. Such a purpose is not only foreign to this Government, but
                                would not be tolerated by the people of the United States. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and his
                                associates are the agents of the Russian people. The Russian Service
                                Corps will continue to be maintained from Russian funds disposed of
                                by the Russian Ambassador at Washington until such time as their
                                service may be either continued or concluded by established
                                authorities in Russia.</p>
                            <p>You may bring this matter, to which this Government attaches great
                                importance, to the attention of the Government to which you are

                                effective operation of the railways for Russia and for the service
                                of the present military assistance in Siberia without prejudice to

                                        has been found advisable by the Government of the United
                                        States to make an arrangement proposed in the memorandum of
                                        American Embassy of September 3 for placing in Mr. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>’s hands general

                                        Railways. They presume that the proposals have been actuated
                                        solely by considerations of military necessity as no other
                                        reason would seem to justify a measure which will
                                        necessitate displacement of Russian officials contemplated
                                        in those proposals. Whatever may be said against <persName

                                        recent political move, it can not be denied that he was duly
                                        appointed as director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and
                                        that his appointment was duly confirmed by the last
                                        recognized Government of Russia. In that capacity he is also
                                        lawfully in charge of the Ussuri Railway administration
                                        which has under Russian law been entrusted to the Chinese
                                        Eastern Railway. It is well understood that Mr. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and members of
                                        railway units under his supervision were equally chosen and
                                        empowered by same Government of Russia which confirmed
                                            <persName corresp="#p_HGL1">General Horvat</persName>’s

                                        belonging to Russian people. It would, however, appear that
                                        they were so chosen and empowered for specific mission of
                                        giving technical advice to Russian Government and railway
                                        officials, and that neither Advisory Commission of Railway

                                        have been authorized to assume direction of Russian railways

                                        scope of defined mission. Accordingly Japanese Government
                                        sincerely apprehends that if <persName corresp="#p_HGL1"

                                        him were to be removed by foreign powers from office which
                                        they have lawfully held, such action might with good reason
                                        be regarded as constituting intervention in Russia’s
                                        domestic administration which it has always been the avowed
                                        policy of Associated Governments to denounce. It then
                                        remains to examine whether the measure now proposed would be
                                        warranted by military necessity of supreme importance. It
                                        will be remembered that at conference of the Allied military
                                        representatives and Russian railway officials held at
                                        Vladivostok on August 21 it was decided that direction and
                                        management of Russian railways be left in hands of Russian
                                        officials. No doubt the question of military necessity was
                                        carefully weighed by the Allied officers who took part in
                                        the conference and full importance should be placed on the
                                        decision <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0308"/>then
                                        adopted, representing as it does the considered views of
                                        military experts on the spot.</p>
                                    <p>In this situation Japanese Government are frankly of opinion
                                        that in the absence of absolute necessity for the purpose of
                                        military transportation, it would be a safer course for any
                                        of cobelligerents to refrain from action such as is now
                                        proposed which, with all its good intentions, might readily
                                        give rise to serious misgivings and frictions.</p>

                                spoke with less conviction, however, and I think that the Japanese

                                infringements for which the Chinese might claim precedent in the

                                feels obligated to make is not intended to be an obstacle to the
                                realization of the project which he considers highly desirable from

                            <p>Since my arrival here Japanese Minister Foreign Affairs has conveyed
                                to me through a third party the information that the Japanese
                                Government is willing to agree that the <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> engineers take over the Chinese Eastern and
                                Trans-Siberian Railways under military protection. He intimated,
                                however, that his Government is greatly embarrassed by the apparent
                                unwillingness of the British Government to agree to the plan. I can
                                not understand this, as <persName corresp="#p_KMF1">General
                                    Knox</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JC1">Colonel
                                    Jack</persName>, the British engineer, and Mr.
                                    <persName>Allston</persName>, the diplomatic agent during
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ESE1">Eliot</persName>’s absence, all
                                profess the conviction that such a plan is the only possible
                                solution of the critical transportation problem. If there is any
                                serious British objection, it comes from a higher source.</p>
                            <p>Apparently all that is needed to carry into effect the plan suggested
                                in my September 18, 10 p.m., is for Great Britain and France to
                                associate themselves with our proposals. There is a practically
                                unanimous desire on the part of representative Russians and Czechs
                                that <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> be given charge.
                                I find the question of transportation even more serious than I
                                anticipated. It should be solved promptly or all our efforts to aid
                                Russia during the coming winter will be useless.</p>

                                September 13, 1918, which has been sent to the Ambassadors in
                                London, Paris, and Rome, relative to the service in Siberia of the
                                Russian Railway Service Corps. This document establishes with all
                                frankness and without reserve the purposes and the spirit of the
                                Government of the United States with regard to the activities of Mr.

                            <p>While the purpose of such activities is to secure the effective
                                operation of the railways for Russia and for the service of the
                                present military assistance in Siberia, this important work will be
                                undertaken in conjunction with Russian railway officials and
                                personnel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and
                                his associates will be considered as agents of the Russian people
                                and the service corps will continue to be maintained, for the time
                                being, from Russian funds disposed of by the Russian Ambassador in
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>I further note that the Government of the United States does not
                                consider that either the Bolsheviki movements or the presence of
                                international military assistance in Siberia or in Manchuria has
                                modified the previously existing rights of Russia or of China, and
                                that all the activities will be performed without prejudice to any
                                previously existing legal, political, or other rights by whomsoever
                                held.</p>
                            <p>I do not need to express how important and gratifying is this
                                definite and sincere statement of the attitude of the United States
                                and how beneficial is such full disclosure of aim in order to
                                anticipate the formation of opinion based on partial information.
                                And this especially, as certain misconceptions have unfortunately

                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNA1">Kudashev</persName> informs me that
                                the American Chargé d’Affaires in Peking has communicated to him a
                                memorandum presented to the Chinese Government and informing that
                                Government of the intentions of the Government of the United States
                                with regard to the operation of the Siberian and Chinese Eastern
                                Railways. While the American Chargé d’Affaires has explained to Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNA1">Kudashev</persName> that Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> will act as an
                                agent of Russia, safeguarding her interests, and that there is no
                                intention whatever to create precedents nor to prejudice the
                                existing rights of Russia, emanating from treaties and in particular
                                relating to the Chinese Eastern Railway, nevertheless the Russian
                                Minister was informed “that it is proposed that the Chinese Eastern
                                Railway will be governed by commissioners appointed by the Chinese
                                Government upon agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName>.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNA1">Kudashev</persName> is of the opinion
                                that such proposition is in contradiction with the existing rights
                                of Russia in regard to the Chinese Eastern Railway. In fact,
                                according to the contract of 1896 between Russian and Chinese
                                Governments, all of the prerogatives of China with respect to the
                                administration of the railroad are embodied with [in] the board of
                                directors of the railroad company, the president of which is
                                appointed by the Chinese Government.</p>
                            <p>The duties of the president are specified in clause 1 of the
                                contract, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The president is appointed by the Chinese Government and is
                                        remunerated by the company. He may have his headquarters in
                                        Peking. It is his special duty to oversee that the
                                        obligations of the railway company toward the Chinese
                                        Government be strictly observed. Besides, the president is
                                        in charge of the correspondence of the company with the
                                        Chinese Government and its central and local
                                        authorities.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>At present the president of the Chinese Eastern Railway is Mr.
                                    <persName>Godzun [Kuo Hsiang-hsi]</persName>, the Governor of
                                the Province of Kirin.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, the only legal authorities with which Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> could cooperate, and in
                                conjunction with whom he may establish proper service of the Chinese
                                Eastern Railway, should be the board of directors with Mr.
                                    <persName>Godzun</persName> as its Chinese president and, in
                                practical matters of technical character, the administration and the
                                personnel of the railway.</p>
                            <p>The proposal that special commissioners be appointed by the Chinese
                                Government to cooperate with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> is certainly to be regarded as a
                                modification of the previously existing rights of Russia or of China
                                and might create a precedent which, in the future, could cause
                                difficulties when reestablishing the legal <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo.</hi></p>
                            <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0316"/>
                            <p>The Russian Minister in Peking states that he will feel it his duty
                                to protest against what he regards to be a violation of, legally and
                                by treaty, established rights.</p>
                            <p>Being aware of the true spirit of the Government of the United
                                States, besides so clearly defined in the telegram of September 13,
                                I assume that the impression created in Peking as to the intentions
                                of the United States Government to enact or to support a scheme,
                                infringing the existing rights of Russia, is due to a
                                misunderstanding.</p>
                            <p>I therefore respectfully request that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> be advised, that, with regard to the
                                effective operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway, he should
                                cooperate with the existing board of directors and, in technical and
                                practical matters, with the administration and the personnel of the
                                railroad. At the same time I would respectfully solicit that a
                                detailed statement of the aims of the Government of the United
                                States in regard to the service of the Russian Railway Service
                                Corps, as expressed in the telegram of September 13, be transmitted
                                to the American Chargé d’Affaires in Peking and be communicated
                                through the latter to the Russian Minister.</p>

                                    >Masaryk</persName> for the Czecho-Slovaks, the Russian Minister
                                at Peking and Russian Ambassador at Washington, have expressed their
                                agreement and also the Japanese Government, which suggests only that
                                the operation be under military protection to which this Government
                                has assented.</p>
                            <p>You may say to the Russian Minister that the Russian Ambassador at
                                Washington is entirely cognizant of the plan and thoroughly in
                                sympathy with it and that this Government must deal of course with
                                the Russian Ambassador at Washington in matters relating to Russia.
                                There can be no objection to your saying to him that we hope he will
                                feel assured that the United States Government is acting in this
                                matter in the interest of the Russian people.</p>

                                Britain, and Vladivostok of its views on this question, at the same

                                of the United States in considering that the powers formerly
                                conferred by the Provisional Government of Mr. <persName

                                    >Pichon</persName> feels it his duty to recall the fact that the
                                whole of the capital stock of the Chinese East[ern] Railway belongs
                                to the Russo-Asiatic Bank, of which more than two thirds of the
                                capital is French but that this reminder of the right of the
                                Russo-Asiatic Bank is solely with the object of making some

                            <p>Your September 23, 5 [4] p.m. In my judgment we can assume that our
                                proposals in regard to the railways have been agreed in principle
                                and that only the method of transfer is still a subject of
                                negotiation. Both <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Matsudaira</persName>
                                and <persName corresp="#p_HGL1">Horvat</persName> have called upon
                                me and I have discussed the details with them at length. The
                                attitude of the French Government has strengthened our position. The
                                British representatives while continuing to express sympathy will
                                not definitely commit themselves.</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#p_HGL1">Horvat</persName>’s object is to avoid
                                personal humiliation and both Great Britain and Japan will I think
                                support him in this effort. The matter is so vital to the interests
                                of Russia that I am proceeding on the assumption that our Government
                                will be satisfied with any method which transfers to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ECH1">Emerson</persName> the unhampered control of
                                operation during the period of military occupation and that it is
                                immaterial whether the transfer is made through <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HGL1">Horvat</persName>, with the consent of the
                                powers interested, or by military order.</p>
                            <p>Unless advised to the contrary I shall conduct the negotiations on
                                this theory agreeing to no terms which do not meet the approval of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ECH1">Emerson</persName>. <persName

                                endeavoring by <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0319"

                                >Stevens</persName>:</p>
                            <p>Your cable through Consul September 24, 4 p.m. Vladivostok car plant,
                                600 men, of whom 100 workmen, balance staff and supernumeraries, no
                                organization, no control; output averages 25 cars per week. Under
                                efficient management should be from 75 to 100 per day. I have
                                personnel to organize properly with military support. Harbin
                                locomotive plant, 700 mechanics, no proper organization or
                                supervision. I have few our service men there but their efforts
                                useless as no attention paid to them. Output about 2 locomotives per
                                week, capacity under my absolute control would be 6 locomotives per
                                day. I would want Vurst and about 20 Baldwin foremen. There are
                                plenty good workmen there, only require absolute authority backed by
                                Allied military support. Same conditions must obtain entire railroad
                                if efficiency is to be had.</p>

                            <p>The following is a summary of railway negotiations to date:</p>
                            <p>In regard to the Chinese Eastern Railway, after several long talks
                                with <persName corresp="#p_HGL1">Horvat</persName>, yesterday noon
                                for the first time he assented in principle to the American
                                proposals and at my suggestion <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> and he have arranged a meeting to discuss
                                details.</p>
                            <p>The method which <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and I
                                propose to submit first to <persName corresp="#p_HGL1">General
                                    Horvat</persName> and then if approved by him to the Allied
                                representatives is that the senior military authorities shall take
                                over the military protection of the railways within their
                                jurisdiction and shall name <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> as Director General of Operation. At the
                                same time an Allied advisory committee shall be created consisting
                                of one representative of each of the powers which have dispatched
                                troops to Siberia and the chairman of this committee shall be a
                                Russian. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> will
                                undertake to report to and advise with this committee at regular
                                intervals but the actual control of operation shall remain wholly in
                                his hands.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the Trans-Siberian Railways the practical problem is
                                even more complicated. The factors to be considered are: <list>

                                        of the Trans-Siberian Railway lines. He is vigorously
                                        opposing any action which would prevent him from regaining
                                        any of his former authority. I have seen him several times
                                        and while he presumes to speak for the remnants of the

                                        conference of all Russia which has grown out of it. For
                                        practical purposes they may be treated as one group. Their
                                        representative, the provisional president, Mr. <persName

                                        Lvov, former Premier of Russia, who strongly sympathizes
                                        with this movement, is with him and I have conferred at
                                        great length with both of them. While holding that the
                                        all-Russian government has <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271"

                                        Russian Government in the Siberian Railways they do not
                                        press this technical contention but point out most earnestly
                                        that any action in reference to the railways which ignores
                                        their existence would greatly injure their whole movement
                                        and might wreck it. They do not ask for recognition but only
                                        for an opportunity to take some formal initiative which
                                        would show to the elements supporting them that <persName
                                            corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> was acting with
                                        their knowledge and consent and thus had the support of the
                                        only existing organ of Siberian public opinion. Their first
                                        suggestion was that they should write to me formally
                                        requesting that <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                            >Stevens</persName> take over the operation of railways.
                                        I objected to this suggestion as carrying with it
                                        implications which might be embarrassing. As an alternative
                                        it was suggested that such a letter might be addressed to
                                            <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> himself
                                        as the agent of the Russian people. This suggestion commends
                                        itself to my judgment; it would represent some expression of
                                        Russian opinion, would be addressed to an agent of the
                                        Russian people and not to a representative of our
                                        Government, and would help to soften any subsequent military
                                        order which might be necessary to place <persName

                            </p>
                            <p>I do not consider the Omsk government very significant. Judging only
                                from many conversations with representative Russians the political
                                situation does not show promise permanent success for any
                                constructive movement. The advent of Allied forces had led to the
                                hope among former officials, civil and military, that they will now
                                regain the power and influence they had before the revolution. The
                                attitude of these officials indicates that they will be relentless
                                in their endeavor to suppress all liberal or moderate movements.
                                Possibly nothing but their inevitable failure will bring them to
                                reason. I can see no objection, however, to an appeal from the Ufa
                                representatives of the Omsk government for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>’s aid.</p>
                            <p>It is my present intention to remain here and endeavor to complete
                                the negotiations as promptly as possible and continue the
                                investigation of economic and social conditions in Siberia. I hope
                                to forward this week for the Department and the War Trade Board
                                suggestions for immediate economic assistance and also a summary of
                                the conclusions reached in consultation with Y.M.C.A. and Red Cross
                                representatives as to the limits of social work this winter.</p>
                            <p>If the negotiations can be concluded within a reasonable time I
                                should like to go westward before venturing to submit report on

                            <p>I have now the honour to inform you that I have received a reply
                                stating that the difficulties which confront a satisfactory solution
                                of the question of railway control in Siberia are fully recognized
                                by His Majesty’s Government. All that they are concerned to see is
                                the efficiency of the railway administration, and any means by which
                                this can best be secured will be welcomed by them.</p>
                            <p>In the circumstances that have arisen, His Majesty’s Government would
                                prefer that the United States and Japanese Governments should
                                arrange the question of actual control, since they are primarily
                                interested, and His Majesty’s Government will fall in with any
                                agreement which may ultimately be reached by those two
                                Governments.</p>

                            <p>There has been a suspension of progress in the railway negotiations
                                since my September 30, 9 p.m. The British representatives are still
                                awaiting some word from their Government. The Japanese
                                representatives, both civil and military, profess to have
                                telegraphed to Tokyo their approval of the plan suggested but fear
                                that the recent change of ministry may delay formal action by their
                                Government. We have conferred with every [Allied?] representative
                                here but while they have all agreed to the plan no one has authority
                                to act.</p>
                            <p>I fear we shall weaken our position by remaining here too long.

                                next Tuesday for Harbin, where I will stay several days prepared to

                            <p>Your October 3, 6 p.m., deeply appreciated. The railway negotiations
                                are not yet concluded. <persName corresp="#p_ULA1"
                                    >Ustrugov</persName> referred to in my September 30, 9 p.m., has
                                been very active in advocating an utterly impracticable plan with a
                                view to delaying action. The new Japanese Ministry to-day cabled its
                                representatives here that it did not approve passages in it but
                                suggested that the Russians under Japanese advisers operate the line
                                from Changchun to Harbin and from Harbin to Karymskaya. This is
                                impossible and <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> with
                                my approval definitely refused to consider it. Two organizations can
                                not operate a main line. This is evident to the Japanese
                                representatives here, who are now earnestly supporting our plan, and
                                they have replied to their Government urging its acceptance. Because
                                of your telegram and of these developments I have given up my
                                journey to Harbin and will remain here.</p>

                            <p>Referring to Siberian railways. If you can clear up the point in
                                doubt in Article 2 of the memorandum of agreement, Department
                                desires you to emphasize the fact that Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>, and the Russian Railway
                                Service Corps which will assist him, will represent Russia and not
                                the United States or any possible interest of the United States. The
                                Department considers this point essential because the United States
                                has no desire or purpose to secure an interest in the railways of
                                Russia or to control them for itself.</p>

                            <p>I returned to Tokyo yesterday and found your October 18, 3 p.m.,
                                here. The phrase referred to was inserted to meet the objection of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_OG1">General Otani</persName>, that his
                                jurisdiction as senior commander extended only over the forces in
                                eastern Siberia and did not cover the Japanese forces guarding the
                                Chinese Eastern in Manchuria or the Czechs now guarding those parts
                                of the Trans-Siberian Railway beyond Chita. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> is convinced that he must
                                have some direct authority from the military commanders in order to
                                avoid conflict of jurisdiction between local railway officials and
                                the military authorities. This we felt could best be accomplished if
                                the senior commander having jurisdiction in the several districts
                                through which the railway passed, would simply confer upon <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> full authority to operate.
                                If this method seems objectionable to you for other reasons, it can
                                be changed, I think, without serious difficulty.</p>

                                        from careful examination compiled separate from the Railway

                                        are located in barracks at Harbin. All the available
                                        barracks, about 19 in number, have been taken over by the
                                        Japanese and although several of the large barracks are
                                        merely guarded and not occupied, it has thus far been
                                        impossible to obtain any quarters for the American troops

                            <p>In a long and informal talk to-day on the railway question, the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that the Japanese
                                Government still hesitates to face the severe criticism which it
                                fears would follow its assent to <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName>’s operation of the Chinese Eastern. There is
                                no objection in regard to the Trans-Siberian Railway.</p>
                            <p>In seeking a possible solution it has occurred to me that we might
                                suggest the following: that <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> should agree to name as a member of his
                                staff <persName corresp="#p_KY1">Kinoshita</persName> or some
                                equally able Japanese railway expert and assign him to duty
                                exclusively on the Chinese Eastern, subject to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>’s instructions in the
                                operations of that road. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> thinks it feasible and I submit it for the
                                consideration of the Department. If approved, I would hold it in
                                reserve as a possible compromise, should the Japanese Government
                                continue to press for entire control of the Chinese Eastern, which
                                is the meaning of the phrase “Russian operation.”</p>

                            <p>The Japanese Government has made no comment on the railway plan

                                of Japanese railway officials passed through Harbin on their way to
                                inspect the Amur line. <persName corresp="#p_GMS1">General

                                        very much disturbed at the large number of Allied troops in
                                        this part of Siberia, and said that he personally thought
                                        that the Russian people would have to depend upon the United
                                        States to see that the agreements entered into prior to our
                                        coming to Siberia were carried out. There seems to be much
                                        anxiety in other quarters about this same subject.</p>

                                    xml:id="d437fn1">Not printed.</note> regarding railway matter.
                                My certain conviction is that any division of authority would result
                                in utter failure to secure necessary efficiency. The basic principle
                                of successful management is centralized authority and
                                responsibility. As the situation now exists, complicated by Russian
                                helplessness and venality, not only would failure result, but owing
                                to high-handed interference and autocratic methods practiced by
                                Japanese in Russian railway affairs serious troubles would be
                                inevitable which might produce international complications. A
                                Japanese <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0332"/>director with
                                equal authority backed by exclusively Japanese troops, could enforce
                                his orders against my judgment leaving me helpless, and the great
                                difference between American and Japanese railway practices, and the
                                very manifest intention of the latter to install their own men
                                everywhere would make irreconcilable views absolutely certain.</p>
                            <p>I am safe in saying that not a member of our service corps would work
                                under any plan that involved Japanese management directly or
                                indirectly. The plan of divided authority as suggested would simply
                                result in sole Japanese control, would make Americans figureheads or
                                worse. The long-time antipathy of the Russians towards the Japanese
                                would be intensified to a degree that nothing less than military
                                force would make the railway machine move at all. The fraternal
                                feeling of the Russians towards Americans would disappear and it
                                already gives unmistakable signs of weakening. Instead of helping
                                Russia the plan would help Japan to strengthen and make secure her
                                grip upon Russia’s eastern provinces and northern Manchuria. A false
                                move at this critical juncture would be barrier to American
                                influence and place us, in Russian eyes, in a position of backing
                                Japan in a plan to disintegrate Russian territory and impair her
                                sovereignty. They are looking to us for material aid and are already
                                discounting our words, being encouraged in this, I believe, by
                                powerful interests. In view of the certain failure of such divided
                                management resulting in even worse conditions than now prevail, and
                                the false position in [into] which Americans would be forced and
                                their prestige destroyed, it would not be possible for me to assume
                                a share in such a management.</p>

                                advises me that he received yesterday instructions from his
                                Government which stated not to continue its policy of giving support
                                to independent Cossack leaders in Siberia. He further stated that
                                following our conversation as reported in my November 8, 4 p.m., he
                                saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs, explained the difficulties
                                which the Canadian troops had encountered in obtaining
                                transportation and advocated the immediate approval of our railway
                                plan as the <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0333"/>only
                                practicable method of remedying conditions. The Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs repeated the objections raised by the General Staff and said
                                that he had suggested to me three possible alternatives: (1) an
                                Allied committee simply to advise the present Russian management;
                                (2) joint management by <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KY1"
                                    >Kinoshita</persName>;<note n="1" xml:id="d438fn2">Director of
                                    the Traffic Bureau of the Japanese Imperial Government
                                    Railways.</note> (3) sole Japanese operation of the Chinese
                                Eastern. As both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>
                                and I appeared unsympathetic to these suggestions he had transferred
                                the negotiations to Washington. In commenting to me on this
                                interview my British colleague expressed regret that the proposals
                                had such a purely American flavor as he feared this had excited
                                unduly Japanese suspicion. He proposed to suggest to his Government
                                the advisability of a joint Allied representation to the Japanese
                                Government in support of our plan which already had the approval of
                                all the Allied representatives at Vladivostok.</p>

                            <p>Three telegrams received to-day by <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_ECH1"
                                    >Emerson</persName> summarized as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Russian officials of the Trans-Baikal Railway report that their
                                organization is completely demoralized. Employees have not been paid
                                for two or three months and on that account engineers, trainmen,
                                operatives, and mechanics have left the service in large numbers.
                                Forty per cent of locomotives are either in need of repairs or are
                                useless because there is not sufficient oil or waste for packing.
                                The result is a complete blockade of freight and passenger traffic
                                apart from the few trains used for military purposes. A similar
                                blockade exists on the Chinese Eastern due to the same causes.
                                Japanese officials have appealed to <persName corresp="#p_HGL1"
                                    >Horvat</persName> to resume management and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_OG1">General Otani</persName><note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d439fn2"><persName corresp="#p_OG1">Gen. Kikuzo
                                        Otani</persName> of the Japanese Army, senior officer of the
                                    Allied forces in Siberia.</note> has issued instructions to
                                Japanese commanders of various divisions that hereafter they must
                                not interfere with or give instructions to Russian railway
                                officials.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> interprets these
                                facts as indicating the betraying of both the Chinese Eastern and
                                Trans-Baikal Railways. He had been consistently predicting that this
                                result was inevitable unless some arrangement could be reached
                                promptly for the management of the roads in the interest of the
                                Russian people. He explains the belated <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284"
                                    facs="0334"/>order of <persName corresp="#p_OG1">General
                                    Otani</persName> as (1) an admission of Japanese interference
                                during the past four months and (2) the first step in railway
                                program to take over the direct operation of the Chinese Eastern and
                                Trans-Baikal as far as Chita. <persName corresp="#p_KY1"
                                    >Kinoshita</persName> stated to <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> over two months ago that they had railway
                                crews available and prior to this a training school for Japanese
                                railway men was opened at Mukden to teach Russian language and
                                methods. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> looks
                                forward confidently to the next move in the program which will take
                                the form of an announcement that <persName corresp="#p_HGL1"
                                    >Horvat</persName> has failed (as fail he must unaided) to
                                operate the Chinese Eastern and that military necessity required the
                                placing of Japanese crews on all trains. He believes that this will
                                mark the completion of a well-thought-out plan to absorb Russia’s
                                interests in Chinese Eastern and at the same time give to Japan the
                                control of all economic activities in northern Manchuria and eastern
                                Siberia. Hence justified in thus submitting Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>’s views for the
                                consideration of the Department as he has unusual opportunities of
                                observation and has predicted each railway move thus far made with
                                extraordinary accuracy.</p>

                                Government’s whole purpose in regard to railways, please take up
                                frankly with the Japanese Government the following points. …</p>
                            <p>(3) In suggesting that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> assume charge of railway operations, as
                                representing Russia and not the United States or any interest of the
                                United States, this Government had the express intention not to
                                modify any previously existing rights of Russia or China. The
                                memorandum of agreement, approved by all the Allied representatives
                                at Vladivostok and by Russian authorities, expressly provides for
                                supervision by international or Russian control and not by any one
                                power. In other words, every measure advocated by this Government
                                has had the purpose of avoiding a monopoly of control creating
                                conditions such as would arouse alarm or suspicion. Moreover, in the
                                opinion of this Government, the question of railway operation is a
                                practical one which the welfare of the Russian people requires
                                should be met by practical measures. Such practical measures of
                                assistance had already been undertaken by the United States, acting
                                in behalf of Russia, in 1917 when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> was requested by the Russian railway
                                administration to secure the assistance of the Russian Railway
                                Service Corps. Furthermore this Government is convinced that a
                                divided control of the operation of the Siberian Railway system is
                                foredoomed to failure. …</p>

                                clear that our purpose to give <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"

                                measure of temporary relief. Our purpose is unchanged that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> is to have control only
                                until his task can either be concluded or continued by responsible
                                Russian authorities. The Department would like to have your views as
                                to how our purpose on this point can be made clear.</p>

                                spent a considerable portion of two days in conference with the
                                Japanese railway expert in an effort to determine just what the
                                General Staff plan of supervision means practically. I was finally
                                able to reduce it to definite terms. In an informal talk this
                                morning, I requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs to submit my
                                analysis of the whole suggestion to the military authorities and
                                inquire whether it was correct. When the memorandum is returned to
                                me, and if approved by the General Staff, I will telegraph it in
                                full with my comments for the consideration of the Department. I
                                have been careful to express no opinion on it. I am rather forcing
                                the issue with the staff in this way because, in the interest of
                                Russian people, I am sincerely anxious to reach some agreement for
                                the operation of the railways and this seems the right moment to
                                press for it.</p>

                            <p>1. It is just about one week since I submitted to the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs an analysis of the plan suggested by the Japanese
                                railway experts and inquired whether it represented the ideas of the
                                Government and General Staff. The plan differed little from the one
                                agreed to at Vladivostok. Although the Minister promised a reply by
                                the 25th or 26th, I have as yet had no word from him.</p>
                            <p>2. During this week I have received three telegrams from <persName

                                that the political situation in Siberia is growing steadily worse;

                                desperate; that the Trans-Baikal is taking three trains daily, all
                                military, but in his opinion used entirely for Japanese commercial
                                goods; that no other goods are moving and the congestion at shipping
                                points may prove disastrous. He believes that the Russian railway
                                administration will break down entirely upon the first extreme cold

                                along the line of the Chinese Eastern to take charge as soon as this
                                happens. The third telegram reads as follows: <quote

                                Japanese General Staff have long had just such an object in view
                                would lead him to credit, perhaps unduly, this information.</p>
                            <p>[3?] Italian colleague has received instructions to cooperate fully
                                with me in reaching an agreement with the Japanese Government along
                                the lines suggested by our Government. I have concurred in his
                                judgment that, for the time, it might be wise to defer any formal
                                representation until our French and British colleagues have heard
                                from their Governments.</p>
                            <p>4. My French colleague was a few days ago instructed to express to
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs the concern of the French
                                Government because [of] the number of Japanese troops in Siberia and
                                Manchuria. He has not acted on these instructions, but pointed out
                                to his Government the inconsistency of such action in view of recent
                                representations as to the need of Japanese troops in Siberia. He <pb
                                    n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0338"/>requested permission to
                                avoid this subject and to join with me in urging the adoption of our
                                plan of railway supervision. He is waiting further advices.</p>
                            <p>5. My British colleague says that his Government has not replied to
                                the suggestions he made two weeks ago and reported in my November
                                10, 7 p.m. He read me, however, several telegrams which he had
                                recently received from <persName corresp="#p_JC1">Colonel
                                    Jack</persName>, the British railway expert at Vladivostok.
                                These indicate that <persName corresp="#p_JC1">Colonel
                                    Jack</persName>, who zealously supported our plan, has changed
                                his mind and now favors the practical elimination of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName>, and suggests that the
                                railways be operated under the supervision of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ULA1">Ustrugov</persName>, who has been named
                                Minister of Communications by the Omsk government. It is possible
                                that he has been influenced by <persName corresp="#p_KMF1">General
                                    Knox</persName> and the British High Commissioner, who I fear
                                have never been in sympathy with our proposals and who, I am
                                informed, have consistently advocated military and financial support
                                to the promoting of a central Siberian government.</p>
                            <p>I am disappointed by these delays but still believe that we can reach
                                a compromise agreement here, although each day appears to make it
                                more difficult, and the lack of adequate railway communication is
                                rapidly producing the expected results. Reports from various sources
                                indicate that there is friction between the British and French
                                military representatives; that the Czecho-Slovak forces are
                                disintegrating into antagonistic factions and that Japanese
                                officials are fomenting suspicion and distrust.</p>
                            <p>I am bold to express the conviction that the Siberian situation in
                                itself is not hopelessly complex. The serious difficulty lies almost
                                wholly with the divergent policies of the Associated Governments. A
                                united policy, even if a compromise, is imperatively called for. If
                                this proves impossible I submit for the consideration of the
                                Department the question whether our pledges to the Russian people
                                require us to decide upon a policy of our own and to prepare to
                                support it.</p>

                            <p>3. The technical board shall act through a president elected by a
                                majority of the members of the board and who may, with the approval
                                of that board, appoint assistants and inspectors in the service of

                                the board. He may assign, if necessary, the corps of railway experts
                                to the more important stations. In assigning railway experts to any
                                of the stations, interests of the respective Allied powers in charge
                                of military protection of such stations shall be taken into due

                            <p>4. The clerical staff of the inter-Allied committee shall be

                            <p>In comparing this plan with the one agreed to at Vladivostok it will
                                be observed that it differs in two main particulars: <list>

                                        been insistent <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0340"/>that
                                        if he is to be made responsible he should have absolute
                                        authority. I recognize the force of this contention but I
                                        think that the change is wise in view of the suspicions
                                        aroused by the idea of control. In practice I believe that
                                        the difference will disappear and that the modified wording
                                        better expresses our own general attitude toward Siberian
                                        problems.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>It changes <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                        >Stevens</persName>’s position from that of general manager
                                        with power to choose his staff to that of president of the
                                        technical board which shall consist of one representative
                                        each from the nations having military forces in Siberia.
                                        Again the difference in practice is small and the method of
                                        naming <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> is
                                        only a more tactful one. It certainly obviates the
                                        disadvantage pointed out by the Department of military
                                        designation or confirmation.</item>

                            <p>The other changes seem to me of minor importance.</p>
                            <p>Speaking generally I believe the plan will work in practice and
                                should be tried. It will give <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> a position of great influence, the moral
                                effect of which in China and Siberia will be valuable; it will
                                certainly improve the present intolerable conditions; it will offer
                                immediate employment to the Railway Service Corps; and most
                                important of all it will establish our position that the Russian
                                railways should not pass under the control of any single nation.</p>
                            <p>I of course recognize that its success depends on the future attitude
                                of the Japanese authorities. In this connection the hopeful factor
                                is the effort of <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Hara</persName><note

                                colleagues to limit the activities of the General Staff. Our
                                acceptance of the modified plan will I believe greatly strengthen
                                their hand.</p>
                            <p>If the Department feels justified in approving this compromise, I
                                submit for consideration the following procedure: that the
                                Department authorize me to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                informally of our Governments concurrence and suggest that the
                                modified plan be forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_IK1"
                                    >Ishii</persName> as the Japanese Government’s reply to your
                                note to him; that the other Governments involved be notified of our
                                agreement with Japan and of the understanding that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> shall be selected as
                                president.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime and if the plan is approved, would the Department
                                consider favorably my returning to Vladivostok for a short period to
                                cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and
                                the Allied representatives in arranging the details necessary to put
                                the agreement into effect? I believe it would be helpful if he could

                            <p>Replying to your November 30, 7 p.m. It would seem to me extremely
                                unwise under present circumstances to modify our position that the
                                Chinese Eastern should be considered as a portion of the main line
                                of Trans-Siberian Railway system. If we confine ourselves to the use
                                of the Amur Railway, as suggested by the Consulate at Vladivostok,
                                we would practically admit Japan’s claim of succession to Russia’s
                                rights in the Chinese Eastern. The plan agreed to by Japan, as
                                reported in my December 2, 10 p.m.,<note n="1" xml:id="d447fn1">Not

                            <p>Replying to your November 23, 2 p.m. The plan now suggested by Japan
                                does not specify any definite time of Allied supervision and
                                assistance. I think public statement should be issued by Allied
                                committee when organized, explaining its purpose and stating
                                definitely that it will continue only so long as the Russian
                                management requires assistance. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> believes that in a reasonable time good
                                working Russian organization can be built up.</p>

                            <p>I forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> the
                                plan of railway operation informally suggested by the Japanese
                                Government and reported in my December 3, 1 a.m. In a telegram just
                                received he comments as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>December 5, 4 p.m. Your cable December 2, 7 p.m. The proposed
                                        plan means that Russians direct operations as now and that
                                        new technical board would only act as adviser with Russians
                                        under no obligations whatever to act upon advice which they
                                        certainly would not do. My long experience with them
                                        demonstrates this beyond question; the railway officials not
                                        only ignore our advice but flout and fairly insult our men
                                        not one of whom would remain as adviser unless forced to do
                                        so. For months I have urged that the only practical way
                                        would be for some one other than Russians [to] <pb n="292"
                                            xml:id="pg_292" facs="0342"/>be given supreme authority
                                        whose orders must be obeyed. I can not change my opinion as
                                        I know proposed plan would result in absolute failure. The
                                        changes from our plan are not only in form but utterly
                                        radical and would emasculate the entire plan. Russians are
                                        satisfied with their own technical staff; they only want
                                        money; would be glad to see us out of the country. If for
                                        diplomatic reasons they should continue their mismanagement,
                                        then all required is an Allied military board to coordinate
                                        military movements. Under the proposed plan chairman would
                                        be figurehead, board would be a farce. Sorry can not agree
                                        with you but in view our many discussions where we always
                                        agreed I can not understand what has occurred to change your
                                        views. I can not accept ambiguous position suggested or
                                        recommend the plan.</p>

                                Japanese authorities, I believe he would have in fact the necessary
                                power. He is convinced that he would not. As the responsibility will
                                be his, we must assume that he is right. Upon hearing from you I am
                                prepared to try once more.</p>

                                the sincere cooperation of Japanese civil and military authorities
                                in carrying out the plan. You may so inform the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs. This Government is concerned in the Siberian Railway
                                situation primarily because reports show quite clearly that
                                paralysis of railway traffic under existing conditions renders it
                                impossible to furnish to the Russians in Siberia the assistance
                                which is vital to enable them to pass the winter without great
                                misery and hardship. Furthermore, the whole question of shipping
                                supplies which may be available for the Russians and Czech forces in
                                Siberia is imperiled. The Department would be glad to receive the
                                proposed plan as a reply on the part of Viscount <persName

                                the execution of the plan. The Department <pb n="293"

                                this Government that he will be willing to undertake this

                                the United States can render to Russia at this juncture and which

                            <p>Your telegram December 6, 3 p.m., and my earlier telegram of to-day.
                                The Department is aware of the obvious difficulties of the proposed
                                plan but believes that it should be given a fair trial by all
                                concerned in view of the fact that winter is at hand and that
                                something must be done immediately to improve the present
                                intolerable condition of transportation facilities. The Secretary,
                                and presumably the President, has approved by wireless your
                                proceeding to Vladivostok to present plan to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and it is earnestly hoped
                                that he will consent. No agreement can succeed unless it can be
                                arranged for the Russians to follow advice and carry out
                                instructions and this Government would decline to have <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> placed in a position where
                                his special capacity can not be made effective. Please so inform him
                                and at your discretion urge upon the Japanese authorities, whose
                                sincere cooperation is relied upon, such further modifications of
                                the plan as actual practice shall demonstrate to be necessary to
                                accomplish the desired result.</p>

                            <p>During the progress of railway negotiations Department has noted the
                                persistence of the suspicion which exists in Japan in regard to the
                                United States. Perhaps it is not possible to overcome this suspicion
                                at once in the minds of the public because it <pb n="294"
                                    xml:id="pg_294" facs="0344"/>seems to be grounded upon
                                apprehensions which the rapid development of the United States has
                                awakened. This Government believes, however, that it owes it to
                                Japan as well as to itself to leave no effort untried to have the
                                facts appreciated by the Japanese Government. The following may be
                                quoted as examples of the character of suspicion and rumor reported: <list>

                                        a cloak for their real purpose, which is to establish

                            <p>It is, therefore, suggested that if occasion offers you discuss this
                                question frankly with members of the Japanese Government. You can,
                                of course, assure them that this Government has no deep policy or
                                hidden purpose in any of the measures it is endeavoring to take in
                                order to assist Russia. You can also say that this Government hopes
                                Japan will not show a lack of confidence in our purpose by failing
                                to bring at once to our attention any matters which seem in any way
                                at variance with the purpose which the United States has declared.

                                were to desire the most complete details in regard to all or any one
                                of them. This is a matter which the Department desires to leave
                                largely to your discretion. At the same time it is hoped that you
                                may see your way clear to broach the subject and advise the
                                Department as to what progress, if any, you believe can be made
                                concerning a question which is regarded as being of the first
                                importance.</p>

                                me under date of December 9, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Your cable 6th. There is no ambiguity whatever in section 2
                                        of your cable 3d. It says explicitly Russians control
                                        operation and only role technical committee could play would
                                        be advisory. … <persName corresp="#p_KY1"
                                            >Kinoshita</persName> fully agreed with me that full
                                        power must be had which the proposed agreement in no manner
                                        provides for. Technical committee, as proposed, would be
                                        basic error, raising instantly impossibility to [possibility
                                        of?] divided authority, which the Department has already
                                        disapproved. A body of men, equal authority, different
                                        nationalities, languages, methods operation, some of them
                                        with ulterior aims, would inevitably clash (see 2). Power
                                        must be one head. Service corps would not remain merely in
                                        advisory capacity. The question of loyalty during war no
                                        longer at issue. As an experiment, plan would discredit all
                                        protestations of assistance from us. Myself and commanders
                                        service corps have reputations we do not care to exchange
                                        for a useless sacrifice. Let us start right or not at all,
                                        far better to take a long time to negotiate than to
                                        undertake what would be not even a forlorn hope. We shall
                                        patiently wait for further developments.</p>

                                        Government consented to the following, changing the plan

                                        portion of the first sentence of section 2, which reads
                                        “while the management of the railways shall be left in the
                                        hands of Russians.” Add to the end of second sentence of
                                        section 2 the phrase “subject only to the supervision herein
                                        provided for.” Strike out the third sentence of section 2.
                                        Amend the first sentence of section 3 so as to read as
                                        follows: “The Technical Board shall elect a president, to
                                        whom shall be intrusted the executive supervision and
                                        operation of the railways and who may, with the approval of

                                        as few changes as possible. I will not suggest these to the

                                president, the authority which <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> considers essential to succeed. I submitted
                                this amended plan to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday
                                afternoon and at the same time I left with him extracts from

                                remarked that the changes which they effected in the Japanese plan
                                were “vital.” He appeared greatly discouraged and when I urged, in
                                the interest of Siberia, prompt action he intimated that an early
                                reply was unlikely. I surmised that he dreaded reopening the
                                question with the military authorities. Bearing in mind the
                                instructions in your cipher telegram December 7, midnight [4 p.m.],

                                        correct. I think the design is to get entering wedge to

                            <p>Recent reports from Siberia are most discouraging. The following
                                telegram from <persName corresp="#p_CJK1">Caldwell</persName> was
                                received this morning: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>December 14, 7 p.m. Railway conditions in Siberia are
                                        intolerable. Road has ceased to function for all practical
                                        purposes. If change for the better is not soon insisted on
                                        it will be impossible to make distribution supplies expected
                                        from America. Congestion of freight (at) Vladivostok will be
                                        only result. We have previously mentioned this to Department
                                        in cable 25. Merchandise will arrive soon and (unless?)
                                        transportation is available our organization will be
                                        helpless. Under circumstances we feel that if feasible we
                                        should be advised of present status of negotiations and
                                        likelihood of decision being reached. Without such
                                        information it is impossible for us to plan our work. The
                                        Government’s generous plan of dealing relief will collapse
                                        unless railway question is settled. This conclusion should
                                        be plainly stated to the Department. <persName

                                matter is of most pressing urgency.</p>
                            <p>Please inform the Minister of Foreign Affairs that this Government
                                agrees thoroughly as to the urgency and importance of the matter and
                                on that account would be glad to know if it is now to understand
                                that the British Government does not favor the proposal made by the
                                United States and approved by France and Italy. As you are aware,
                                the British Ambassador at Tokyo, apparently owing to lack of
                                instruction from his Government, has remained indifferent throughout
                                the negotiations in spite of the support of this Government’s
                                proposals previously expressed by British representatives in
                                Siberia.</p>
                            <p>Any plan which promises effective operation will, no doubt, be better
                                than present deplorable conditions produced by practical <pb n="300"

                                Eastern which blocks entry of all supplies for Russians and Czechs
                                in Siberia. This Government is not disposed however to consider an
                                alternative to a plan which received such wide support as that which
                                it has proposed unless it is evident that both Great Britain and
                                Japan are unfavorable to it.</p>
                            <p>The railway negotiations between the American and Japanese
                                Governments have resulted in an agreement on all essential points
                                save the one question as to the measure of authority to be given the
                                person responsible for the actual operation of the railway system.
                                The firm conviction of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJF1"
                                    >Stevens</persName> as to this point is that for efficient
                                management an undivided authority is essential and he is unwilling
                                to risk an experiment under conditions which to him seem to make for
                                certain failure.</p>
                            <p>This Government need surely go no further in assuring the Government
                                of Great Britain that the question at issue, so far as the
                                Government of the United States is concerned, is solely the one of
                                the effective operation of the railways for Russia and without
                                modification of previously existing rights by whomsoever held. Since
                                the other Governments concerned are now agreed and only the one
                                point of difference remains between the United States and Japan,
                                this Government would like to be informed whether or not the
                                Government of Great Britain would at this time be disposed to
                                approve the proposals of the United States. Repeat to Paris, Rome,
                                and Archangel for information.</p>

                                with them to-day concerning railway. It is the earnest desire of
                                these men to place the railway in the hands of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and they can not understand
                                why the obstacles thereto are not overcome. They can not see why
                                there should be any obstacles at all, as [they] wish to see the plan
                                agreed between <persName corresp="#p_SJF1">Stevens</persName> and
                                [them] two months ago carried into effect at once. If there is
                                anything our Government can do in this matter, I strongly urge that
                                some action be undertaken at once, for this is the mainspring to any
                                attempts on our part or that of Allies to assist Siberia. This
                                question <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0351"/>must first be
                                solved above all others. There are at present available 3,000
                                engines and 90,000 ears, but a large per cent of them are tied up
                                through hopeless congestion of traffic, and Russian railway men
                                admit that they are powerless to solve the problem. It is also
                                essential that the inter-Allied railway commission should settle in
                                Omsk instead of Vladivostok. Have discussed this matter with
                                Montgomery Schuyler, former diplomatist, now here, and he agrees
                                with me that something must be done at once in railway question.
                                Please telegraph me Department’s views.</p>

                                <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs further informed me 13,880 Japanese

                                    more would begin on January 1. This will leave about 20,000 to

                                approaches our own, is a sincere effort on the part of the present

                                telegrams: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>December 29, 7 p.m. Your cable December 27, 11 [10] p.m. I am
                                        giving amended plan consideration; would like further
                                        information. Have you agreement, secret or otherwise, [as
                                        to] who would be president technical board? … Without
                                        committing myself would say section 3, president’s powers,
                                        should include economic as well as technical operation.
                                        Section 3 says president may issue instructions Russian
                                        officials but gives him no power whatever to enforce such
                                        instructions. He should at least have power dismissal
                                        Russian officials and all his powers should be entirely
                                        independent of technical board. He should have power to
                                        distribute his experts not only at important stations but
                                        wherever he deems necessary.</p>
                                    <p>Section 1 says technical board shall be under control of the
                                        Allied committee. This would take all control of operation
                                        away from technical board or its president and would
                                        neutralize all succeeding paragraphs. I could not agree to
                                        this. I see no reason why, if good faith is intended, matter
                                        can not be put in plain takers [terms]. I think your
                                        [supposition wrong?] that president is given full power by
                                        the wording of the proposed agreement. I fail to see that
                                        president is independent in the last analysis of technical
                                        board.</p>
                                    <p>Of course there can be no objection to the 5th section. If an
                                        agreement can be reached, absolutely necessary that War
                                        Department distributes American troops sufficient numbers
                                        along the line as far as Japanese are quartered. I would
                                        like to hear from you as to above points. I can not see the
                                        way to express views to the Department without further
                                        consideration.</p>
                                    <p>December 30, 2 p.m. Further. Your [my] cable December 29, 7
                                        p.m. (1) Technical board, in all matters operation and
                                        railway economics, must be independent of Allied committee;
                                        (2) president technical board must not be under control of
                                        board in matters of operation; he must be free to exercise
                                        his judgment in such matters, regardless of views of the
                                        majority of board; (3) president must have absolute power to
                                        enforce and make effective his orders to any and all Russian
                                        railway officials; (4) protection of railway by Allied
                                        troops must mean that American soldiers shall be distributed
                                        in sufficient numbers as far west as are Japanese
                                        soldiers.</p>
                                    <p>Above in addition and elaboration of my cable yesterday.
                                        Careful study of the amended proposition forces me to the
                                        conclusion <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0354"/>that it
                                        can be construed as making no essential change from the
                                        original. I agree with you that we should effect change of
                                        policy but feel that ambiguous wording of plan should be
                                        eliminated. Why not have takers [terms] put in language that
                                        can not be mistaken?</p>

                                            <item>I have a definite understanding with the Japanese
                                                Foreign Office that if the plan now submitted is

                                            <item>Personally I think it would be a mistake to
                                                require authority in economic questions such as
                                                freight and passenger tariffs. Such questions, it
                                                seems to me, should be determined by the technical
                                                board subject to the control of the inter-Allied
                                                committee as provided in the agreement. Otherwise
                                                there would be continued criticism and suspicion
                                                both by Russians and by competing nationalities,
                                                particularly if trade conditions in Siberia
                                                improve.</item>
                                            <label>3.</label>
                                            <item>I submit that you have not given to sections 2 and
                                                3 (which should be read together) the full import of
                                                their wording. Delegating of power to the president
                                                is contained in the words, “To whom shall be
                                                intrusted the technical operation of the railways.”
                                                That is a grant so broad that to enumerate any
                                                specific powers would only limit rather than enlarge
                                                it. As it stands it is only limited by the
                                                requirement in section 2 that “at the head of each
                                                railway shall remain a Russian manager or director,”
                                                not the present managers or directors necessarily
                                                but Russian managers or directors, and to them you
                                                are authorized to issue instructions and if anyone
                                                should not obey I assume you would discharge him and
                                                appoint some other Russian. One specific power is
                                                given, which by its very nature does enlarge the
                                                general power, and that is the authority to employ
                                                other nationalities as assistants, experts, and
                                                inspectors. This is a power specified because it
                                                would not be of necessity implied with their general
                                                power to operate Russian railways.</item>

                                            <item>You are right that the administrative acts of the
                                                technical board are subject to the control, of the
                                                inter-Allied committee, and one of these
                                                administrative acts is to elect a president, to
                                                whom, by the terms of the agreement itself, is
                                                intrusted the technical operation of the railways.
                                                While the technical board, with the approval of the
                                                inter-Allied committee, elects the president and
                                                thus fulfills its first purpose of administrating
                                                the technical management on many railways, neither
                                                it nor the Allied committee can interfere with or
                                                modify the authority of the president, so elected
                                                because the authority was conferred directly by the
                                                agreement of the associated nations and not by the
                                                action of the committee or the board. I can not
                                                therefore agree with your conclusion that the
                                                authority of the president could be neutralized.
                                                After electing the president, the inter-Allied
                                                committee and the technical committee have no
                                                further control over technical operation and are
                                                limited to economic questions.</item>

                            <p>… correspondent of the …, arrived here on way home. Has been through
                                Siberia as far as Ural Mountains and had unusual opportunities to
                                observe conditions. His knowledge of Russian language greatly aided
                                him in many conferences with leading men. He was in Omsk both before
                                and after the proclamation of <persName corresp="#p_KAV1"
                                    >Kolchak</persName>’s dictatorship. He reports that the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KAV1">Kolchak</persName> movement was
                                engineered by former officials of old regime and in the interest of
                                a monarchy; that it has been most unfavorably received in those
                                parts of Siberia through which he passed and that he is convinced
                                that <persName corresp="#p_KMF1">General Knox</persName> was
                                involved in it. It is most unfortunate that <persName

                                in these internal controversies. He seems to have been a disturbing
                                factor from the day of his arrival. I fear that his activities may
                                be interpreted by many Russians as expressing the views of the
                                Associated Governments.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Referring to the
                                cablegrams from the American Consul in Vladivostok, regarding
                                certain steamers of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, copies of which you
                                kindly forwarded to me, I wish to bring to your attention that the
                                boats mentioned, namely <hi rend="italic">Nijni Novgorod,
                                    Kishinev</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Toula</hi>, are part of the
                                Volunteer Fleet steamers which were chartered on the 30 March to the
                                United States Shipping Board. Therefore any disposal of these boats
                                for Kamchatka service would necessitate a special arrangement with
                                the United States Government.</p>
                            <p>Ordinarily these boats used to carry different supplies for the
                                Kamchatka population, however the bulk of their cargo being salt,
                                different implements and materials for the extensive fisheries of
                                the northeast Asiatic coast. On their return voyage these boats
                                brought back large amounts of salted fish and other products of the
                                fisheries which, besides what was used for local consumation, was
                                shipped from Vladivostok by rail to the interior of Russia.</p>
                            <p>Before considering any actual arrangements for providing the
                                Kamchatka fisheries with necessary tonnage, it appears advisable to
                                ascertain definitely to what measure the conditions prevailing at
                                present in Russia affect the fisheries trade of the Russian Far
                                East. The extent of actual operations which will take place during
                                the coming season will depend on the amount of salt and other
                                materials which can be provided in Vladivostok, on the labor market
                                as well as on the storage capacities of the Vladivostok harbor, and
                                especially on the transportation conditions of the Trans-Siberian
                                Railroad.</p>
                            <p>It seems therefore desirable that the American Consul at Vladivostok
                                should be directed to furnish specific data as to the real prospects
                                of the fisheries trade for the coming season and would communicate
                                the amount of tonnage actually required in the present
                                conjuncture.</p>
                            <p>As to the S.S. <hi rend="italic">Simferopol</hi>, detained at Manila,
                                I beg leave to advise that this boat is a rather small vessel of
                                less than two thousand tons deadweight. This boat could be utilized
                                immediately for <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0362"/>Kamchatka
                                service, postponing general decisions until further information is
                                available. As the Kamchatka cruises usually start early in May, I
                                venture to suggest that the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Simferopol</hi>
                                be released from Manila at the earliest possible date and be
                                directed to proceed to Vladivostok.</p>

                            <p>575. The following names of Russian steamers requisitioned by the
                                British. His Majesty’s Government only regard principle of 50 per
                                cent division between British and United States Governments as
                                applying to neutral and ex-enemy tonnage, and had not considered
                                this as applying to Russian ships. They are willing, however, to
                                agree to 50 per cent division of those ships which were not
                                previously engaged in European-Allied service prior to November 24,
                                1917, this reservation being the same as that made by the United
                                States Government in respect to the Norwegian vessels. His Majesty’s
                                Government state that they expect the United States Government to
                                apply same principle of division to any Japanese ships that may be
