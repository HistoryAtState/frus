                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the foreign policy decision making of
                    the administration of President Jimmy Carter. The focus of the volume is on the
                    administration’s approach to events in the Horn of Africa and includes relations
                    with Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti (before and after its independence). </p>
                <p>This volume addresses Somali President Siad Barre’s entreaties for U.S. military
                    aid before and after the Somali invasion of Ethiopia’s Ogaden Desert, the U.S.
                    response to Soviet and Cuban intervention on behalf of Ethiopia, attempts to
                    negotiate an end to the Ogaden war, and efforts to retain U.S. influence in the
                    region. Furthermore, the volume documents the arguments between Secretary of
                    State Cyrus Vance and the Assistant to the President for National Security
                    Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski over an appropriate response to the Soviet
                    intervention, and whether to link Soviet behavior in the Horn of Africa to other
                    bilateral issues, such as Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.</p>

                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                        en<pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>gaged in foreign policy
                    formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State
                    historians by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most
                    of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been
                    declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977–1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the Jimmy Carter Presidential
                    Library and other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                    staff of the Carter Library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Carter Library include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related
                    documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments to a given document were in fact attached
                    to the paper copy of the docu<pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>ment in the
                    Carter Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to time in Washington, DC.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modem typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text,
                    except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes
                    and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
                    correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases
                    underlined in the original document are printed in italics. Abbreviations and
                    contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each volume. In
                    telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as <gloss
                        target="#t_Secto_1">Secto</gloss>) is printed at the start of the text of
                    the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed in their
                    chronological place with headings, source notes, and the number of pages not
                    declassified.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in the
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation of the series and declassification of records. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2012 and was completed in
                    2015, resulted in the decision to withhold 1 document in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 6 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 19 documents. The Office of the Historian is confident, on the
                    basis of the research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the
                    declassification review process described above, that the documentation and
                    editorial notes presented here provide a thorough, accurate, and <pb n="VII"

                <p>The focus of this volume is on the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration’s approach to events in the Horn of Africa and includes relations
                    with Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti (before and after its independence). The
                    conflict in the Horn of Africa from 1977 to 1978 was one of the first foreign
                    policy crises for the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration, and as such, served as an early part of <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s foreign policy education. First, the
                    Ethiopian revolution’s leftward turn and a new arms agreement with the Soviet
                    Union tested the administration’s stated intentions to not view all African
                    problems as East-West problems. Nonetheless, administration officials were
                    tempted to provide arms to Somalia for precisely those Cold War concerns.
                    Second, the Soviet and Cuban intervention on behalf of Ethiopia in the Ogaden
                    War tested the feasibility of U.S.-Soviet détente. Washington hoped to use the
                    prospects of bilateral agreements, particularly on arms control, as leverage for
                    influencing Moscow’s international behavior. The Soviet intervention in the
                    Horn, which occurred at the same time that Washington and Moscow were engaged in
                    Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II),
                    indicated to the administration that détente was not suceeding. Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName> and National Security
                    Adviser <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> engaged in
                    some contentious debates on the proper U.S. response to the Soviet and Cuban
                    intervention and the idea of linking progress on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                        >SALT</gloss> to Soviet withdrawal from the Horn of Africa. <persName
                        corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> argued that the importance of achieving
                    an arms limitations agreement far out-weighed U.S. frustration with the Soviet
                    military presence in Africa. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                    argued that the United States could not simply allow the Soviet Union to get
                    away with its intervention in Ethiopia or else Moscow would be further <pb n="X"
                        facs="0011" xml:id="pg_X"/>emboldened to take advantage of other conflicts
                    on the continent. Ultimately, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> did raise the issue several
                    times with their Soviet counterparts, exacerbating bilateral tensions.</p>
                <p>This volume does not include documents on base negotiations with Somalia in 1979
                    and 1980. Since the administration treated this goal as part of its overall
                    Middle East strategic planning, these discussions can be found in <ref

                    decisions and actions, the editors have identified key documents regarding major
                    covert actions and intelligence activities. The following note will provide
                    readers with some organizational context on how covert actions and special
                    intelligence operations in support of U.S. foreign policy were planned and
                    approved within the U.S. Government. It describes, on the basis of declassified
                    documents, the changing and developing procedures during the Truman, Eisenhower,

                <p>The Truman administration’s concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted
                    the new National Security Council to authorize, in <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"

                    Central Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the
                    same time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>)
                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in
                    part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could
                    be funded with minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1"

                    mandate dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The

                    <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                        >CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any

                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:

                    organizing and managing covert actions. The OPC, which was to take its guidance

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President Kennedy’s request and submitted a report
                    in June that recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert
                    operations. As a result of the Taylor Report, the Special Group, chaired by the
                    President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy, and
                    including Deputy Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson, Deputy Secretary of
                    Defense Roswell Gilpatric, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, and
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater
                    responsibility for planning and reviewing covert operations. Until 1963 the
                        <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> determined whether a <gloss

                    Special Group. In 1963 the Special Group developed general but informal
                    criteria, including risk, possibility of success, potential for exposure,
                    political sensitivity, and cost (a threshold of $25,000 was adopted by the
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>), for determining whether covert action
                    projects were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8" xml:id="Notesfn8"

                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership
                    was the same as the Special Group plus Attorney General Robert Kennedy and
                    General Taylor (as Chairman), exercised responsibility for Operation Mongoose, a

                <p>The effectiveness of covert action has always been difficult for any
                    administration to gauge, given concerns about security and the difficulty of
                    judging the impact of U.S. initiatives on events. In October 1969 the new Nixon
                    administration required annual 303 Committee reviews for all covert actions that
                    the Committee had approved and automatic termination of any operation not
                    reviewed after 12 months. On February 17, 1970, President Nixon signed National
                    Security Decision Memorandum 40,<note n="13" xml:id="Notesfn13" type="source"

                    Attorney General was also added to the membership of the Committee. NSDM 40 <pb

                    covert operations and directed him to obtain policy approval from the 40
                    Committee for all major and “politically sensitive” covert operations. He was
                    also made responsible for ensuring an annual review by the 40 Committee of all
                    approved covert operations.</p>
                <p>The 40 Committee met regularly early in the Nixon administration, but over time
                    the number of formal meetings declined and business came to be conducted via
                    couriers and telephone votes. The Committee actually met only for major new
                    proposals. As required, the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> submitted
                    annual status reports to the 40 Committee for each approved operation. According
                    to the 1976 Church Committee Final Report, the 40 Committee considered only
                    about 25 percent of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s individual covert
                    action projects, concentrating on major projects that provided broad policy
                    guidelines for all covert actions. Congress received briefings on only a few
                    proposed projects. Not all major operations, moreover, were brought before the
                    40 Committee: President Nixon in 1970 instructed the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1"

                <p>The Hughes-Ryan amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 brought about a
                    major change in the way the U.S. Government approved covert actions, requiring
                    explicit approval by the President for each action and expanding Congressional

                    covert actions only after the President had signed a “finding” and informed

                    administration, the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>-I established a

                    other sensitive intelligence matters and report to the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1"
                        >SCC</gloss>-I. This interagency working group was chaired by the Deputy

                        target="#t_SAWG_1">SAWG</gloss>). The <gloss target="#t_SAWG_1">SAWG</gloss>
                    was active in early <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration reviews of ongoing covert action, and remained active through at
                    least 1978. <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> officials in mid-1978 sought to
                    downgrade or abolish the <gloss target="#t_SAWG_1">SAWG</gloss> and replace it
                    as needed with ad hoc working groups. Internal <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                        >NSC</gloss> reviews at the end of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName> administration state that the <gloss target="#t_SAWG_1"
                        >SAWG</gloss> gradually fell out of use. By late 1979, the means for
                    debating, developing, and guiding certain covert actions was an interagency
                    working group chaired by <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> at the
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. This group was referred to by several
                    names during the late <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration, including the Deputy’s (or Deputies) group, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> group, the interagency group, the Black
                    Chamber, and the Black Room.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration made use of a
                    new category of presidential findings for “world-wide” or “general” (or
                    “generic”) covert operations. This continued a practice initiated late in the
                    Ford administration in response to the Hughes-Ryan requirement for presidential
                    findings. The worldwide category covered lower-risk operations that were
                    directed at broad policy goals implemented on a worldwide basis as assets
                    allowed. These operations utilized existing assets as well as existing liaison
                    contacts with foreign intelligence or security services, and in some cases also
                    consisted of routine training or procurement undertaken to assist foreign
                    intelligence partners or other agencies of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                        >USG</gloss>.A new type of document—known as “Perspectives”—provided more
                    specific tasking guidance for these general, worldwide covert activities.
                    Perspectives detailed the themes to be stressed in furtherance of a particular
                    policy goal. Riskier operations required their own presidential finding or
                    Memorandum of Notification (see below). Perspectives were drafted by the <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and cleared by the Department of State, so
                    that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could vet the operational
                    feasibility and risks of the program while State could assess the diplomatic
                    risks and verify that the program was consistent with overall foreign policy
                    goals. At least initially, Perspectives did not require further coordination
                    with the OAG, <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>, or the President. Once an
                    agreed-upon Perspectives document was finalized by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                        >CIA</gloss> and the Department of State, it was transmitted to the field,
                    and posts were required to make periodic reports on any achievements under the
                    Perspectives guidelines. Beginning in 1978, actions in this worldwide category
                    were authorized by the President as specific line-item additions to a previously
                    existing “world-wide” finding, though Perspectives were still used to provide
                    additional details.</p>

                <p>Another new document used during the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName> administration was the “Memorandum of Notification”(MON).
                    MONs were initially used to introduce higher-risk, significantly higher-cost, or
                    more geographically-specific operations under a previously-approved worldwide or
                    general objective outlined<note n="19" xml:id="Notesfn19" type="source"

                        E.O. 12036 governed foreign intelligence activities, all references in the
                        E.O. to the “<gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>” were effectively
                        references to what was known in practice as the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1"
                            >SCC</gloss> (Intelligence), or <gloss target="#t_SCC_1"
                        >SCC</gloss>–I.</note> in a Perspectives document. Like Perspectives, MONs
                    had to be coordinated between the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the
                    Department of State, but they also required broader interagency coordination
                    within the <gloss target="#t_SAWG_1">SAWG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SCC_1"
                        >SCC</gloss>. MONs subsequently came to be used for significant changes to
                    any type of finding, not just worldwide ones. Entirely new covert actions
                    continued to require new presidential findings. The Hughes-Ryan amendment
                    stipulated that Congress be notified of new findings “in a timely fashion,” but
                    did not specify how much time that meant. During the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration, the <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> typically notified Congress of new covert
                    initiatives within 48 hours, including those outlined in Perspectives or
                    MONs.</p>
                <p>In October 1980, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1981—also
                    known as the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980—scaled back the Hughes-Ryan
                    amendment’s provisions for congressional oversight of covert action. While the
                    requirement to notify Congress about presidential findings remained in place,
                    the new Act limited the committees of Congress that had to be briefed to the two
                    intelligence committees, and also explicitly clarified that this requirement to
                    keep the committees “fully and currently informed” did not constitute a
                    requirement for congressional approval of covert action or other intelligence
                    activities. Moreover, the new Act stipulated that if the President determined it
                    was “essential to limit prior notice to meet extraordinary circumstances
                    affecting vital interests of the United States,” the President could limit prior
                    notice to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the two intelligence
                    committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and the majority and
                    minority leaders of the Senate—a group that came to be known as the “Gang of
                    Eight.” If prior notice of a covert action was withheld, the President was
                    required to inform the two intelligence committees “in a timely fashion” and
                    provide a statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice.<note n="20"

                        years. Ethiopia’s increasing radicalization and anti-U.S. sentiment resulted
                        in decreased U.S. access to bases and airfields, as well as the erosion of a
                        longstanding relationship with an important regional ally. The Ford
                        administration debated the merits of military and economic engagement. The
                        decreased importance of Kagnew Station, a multi-purpose U.S. military
                        installation in Asmara, Eritrea, as a communications base and the
                        development of Kenya and Sudan as more consistent regional allies made the
                        argument for continued engagement less compelling.</p>
                    <p>However, members of the administration who were concerned about Soviet
                        inroads in Somalia argued that a diminished U.S. presence in Ethiopia would
                        be perceived as a Cold War “loss,” and believed that regional instability
                        would result. Contributing to those concerns was the impending independence
                        of the French Territory of the Afars and Issas (Djibouti). Djibouti’s port,
                        essential to Ethiopian foreign trade, was coveted by Somali irredentists.
                        The Ford administration feared that war between Ethiopia and Somalia over
                        Djibouti was a distinct possibility.</p>
                    <p>During the Presidential transition, an interdepartmental group weighed the
                        relative merits of halting or continuing the arms pipeline to Ethiopia,
                        whether to be proactive with economic aid, and whether Ethiopian moderates
                        would benefit from U.S. support. (See <ref target="frus1969-76ve06#d170">

                            >EPRP</gloss>). Although Addis Ababa is calm for moment, new wave of
                        arrests and violence is quite possible before long. At same time, Embassy
                        does not anticipate radical policy departures from existing revolutionary
                        program, despite <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s

                        summary.</p>
                    <p>1. After last week’s purge,<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">In telegram 656 from
                            Addis Ababa, February 3, the Embassy reported on the official
                            announcement of the deaths of leading <gloss target="#t_PMAC_1"
                                >PMAC</gloss> members, including <gloss target="#t_PMAC_1"
                                >PMAC</gloss> Chairman Teferi Bante, which left <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu Haile Mariam</persName> solely in charge
                            of Ethiopia. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D770039–0586)</note> it seems clear that <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> is riding higher than ever before. If there is any
                        leading figure who could form new pole of opposition to him remaining within
                        Dirg, he is not yet apparent to this Embassy. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>’s first order of business is to put Dirg back
                        together and fill in gaps, most prominent of which is that of Chief of
                        State. <gloss target="#t_PMAC_1">PMAC</gloss> meeting scheduled for Feb 7
                        probably grappled with that very problem. From what we know of his past
                        preferences, it is not at all certain that he will decide to assume <gloss
                            target="#t_PMAC_1">PMAC</gloss> chairman role himself. In that respect
                        Teferi Bante served useful purpose in relieving him of ceremonial duties and
                        public exposure to those (like Western envoys) <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> did not particularly want to see. Thus a new
                        titular head of state makes much sense. In any event, what <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> decides is certain at this point
                        to be rubber-stamped by remainder of <gloss target="#t_PMAC_1">PMAC</gloss>,
                        since open disagreement has proven clearly unhealthy.</p>
                    <p>2. While Dirg top ranks have been decimated in last days, and death of <gloss
                            target="#t_POMOA_1">POMOA</gloss> Vice-Chairman Senaye Likke also no

                        <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss> hearts, <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1"
                            >EPRP</gloss> in long run has most to lose from shake-up. Those in
                            <gloss target="#t_PMAC_1">PMAC</gloss> favoring accommodation with
                            <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss> are gone, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> will surely launch strong
                        crackdown aimed at hard <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss> core possibly
                        sweeping up in process many non-affiliated sympathizers of <gloss
                            target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss> goals and some innocent bystanders. On
                        other hand, some were already counting <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1"
                            >EPRP</gloss> out late last fall, only to see resurgence over past ten
                        days of <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss>-inspired assassinations,
                        anti-government incidents, and leaflet distribution. Such activities are
                        bound to continue, and <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> must
                        realize that, after his actions of past week he is more a marked man than
                        ever, with Haile Fida also high on most wanted list, and not only in eyes of
                        their enemies in <gloss target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss>. At a time when
                        summary justice is being dealt out, however, clandestine activity likely to
                        decline for next week or so, while both sides devise new strategies.</p>
                    <p>3. Some observers view purge in terms of hardliner versus moderate struggle.
                        We have no evidence that leads us to believe that seven killed were any less
                        dedicated than those remaining to carrying out national democratic
                        revolution program, although in proposing one more attempt to bring <gloss
                            target="#t_EPRP_1">EPRP</gloss> back into fold, they may have been
                        casting about for more pragmatic solutions to current Dirg problems. Purge
                        may also have removed some of brakes on decision-making process, but we
                        doubt that <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> course will be radically
                        changed as result. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s first
                        public statements imply that pace of revolution to accelerate, but we do not
                        see national political party emerging any faster for example, and <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> has no greater means this week than last
                        to step up offensive against its military enemies, despite its brave talk
                        about arming masses and tributes to men in uniform. One likelihood is that
                        Politburo will regain influence it appeared to have lost as result Dec 29

                        Rumors have always abounded of strong animosity between him and <persName

                        potentially dangerous opponent, but he is not known as ambitious man, and he
                        has served useful purpose of organizing peasants’ militia throughout
                        country, a program <pb n="4" facs="0039" xml:id="pg_4"/>which appears to
                        figure largely in <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s

                        heretofore. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s statement
                        that “except for <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, Mother Ethiopia
                        does not have a single revolutionary friend in the region” adopts
                        belligerent stance towards all neighboring countries, including Kenya. This
                        stance, coupled with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> site problem and
                            <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>’s failure to tend to its fences
                        with Sub-Saharan Africa in general, would tend to weaken Ethiopia’s
                        negotiating position. It is also not clear why both <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> in his Feb 4 speech and media
                        since have almost entirely eliminated derogatory reference to Somalia and

                        simply mean recognition on <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                        >Mengistu</persName>’s part that Ethiopia has enough immediate troubles in
                        country and to north, without picking yet another fight with Somalia, this
                        aspect nevertheless bears watching, given growing indications that Soviets
                        may have decided to try to play more active role in Ethiopia without
                        disrupting their close ongoing relationship with Somalia. Some Addis
                        observers are already speculating that apparent downplay of relations with
                        Somalia indicates Soviets are doing just that.</p>
                    <p>6. Craven procession of Soviet, Cuban, and other East European Ambassadors to

                        support for rump government indicates greater degree of commitment by

                        than to collective leadership of past. Ambassadors may also have been in

                            >Mengistu</persName>’s mind that they may have had close past contacts

                        pro-Soviet Ethiopia. From this perspective it is surprising that Soviet

                    <p>2. QTE Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I consider it to have been fortunate that our meeting in Zanzibar provided an
                        opportunity for contact between our two governments so soon after the
                        installation of the new U.S. administration. I appreciate your willingness
                        to give me the benefit of your forthright views on Somali policy, the
                        situation in the Horn of Africa, and the factors affecting relations between
                        our two nations.</p>
                    <p>3. I am confident that you will find that the new U.S. administration will
                        not approach African problems with pre-conceived ideas of how they should be
                        solved but will, instead, make an effort to seek out the views of African
                        leaders in the first instance and to give those views full weight in
                        developing U.S. attitudes and policies toward those problems. We recognize
                        fully that solutions imposed by extra-continental powers can have no lasting
                        beneficial effect, and that a proper American role is to support peaceful
                        solutions to African problems acceptable to Africans.</p>
                    <p>4. In the light of your desire for improved relations with the United States,
                        I want to assure you that friendship between our two nations and peoples
                        need not be obstructed by honest differences of views between us, or by our
                        respective adoption of differing ideologies. It remains our policy to
                        maintain good relations with non-aligned countries, and our friendly
                        relations with a number of non-aligned states bears witness to this fact.
                        Somalia’s friendship with the Soviet Union need not in itself be a bar to
                        improved U.S.-Somali relations. However, you acknowledged to me your
                        recognition of the fact that the U.S. has international responsibilities. In
                        gauging the extent to which an improvement can be achieved in U.S.-Somali
                        relations, which the U.S. administration desires, you will surely understand
                        that we have to take into account the degree to which the relationship
                        enjoyed by the Soviet Union with Somalia impinges upon U.S. international
                        strategic responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>5. I am confused by your mention that the U.S. refused to help Somalia during
                        a serious drought. On my return to the United States, I asked for an
                        investigation of this matter, and I find that, in response to an appeal to
                        our Ambassador by Vice President Kulmiye on December 7, 1974, the United
                        States promptly diverted a vessel bearing 1500 tons of biscuits to
                        Mogadiscio, where it arrived on December 25. The total value of U.S. drought
                        relief aid to Somalia in 1974 and 1975 was almost dols 10 million. In
                        response to your government’s request last year, the U.S. shipped another
                        10,000 tons of drought relief grain at a cost of over dols 2.5 million. The
                        United States Government remains prepared to assist in the relief of natural
                        catastrophes should they reoccur in Somalia or elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>6. In closing, I should like to thank you again for the time you spent with
                        me in Zanzibar. I hope that our exchange there and through <pb n="7"
                            facs="0042" xml:id="pg_7"/>this letter will be followed by an
                        intensified dialogue between our two governments which will result in better
                        relations between our two countries. Fortunately, an opportunity for a
                        continuation of this dialogue will present itself on March 1 and 2 when

                        the Department of Defense. All US dependents were withdrawn early in 1976
                        after two US personnel were killed by a land mine and five others were
                        kidnapped by the insurgents, and for over a year US personnel there have
                        lived under the severe curfew imposed by the government in Asmara.<note

                    <p>(S) The Eritrean insurgency has intensified in recent months, with some
                        attacks occurring close to Kagnew. Public statements by the Government of
                        Sudan promising support for the Eritrean liberation movement have added to
                        the tension, as has the sharply negative reaction of the Ethiopian
                        government to our termination of materiel military assistance and our
                        criticism of violations by the Ethiopians of basic human rights.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d5fn3">In congressional testimony on February 24, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> announced that
                            military assistance to several countries, including Ethiopia, would be
                            reduced because of human rights violations. See the Department of State
                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 14, 1977, pp. 236–241.</note>
                        The Department of Defense believes that the situation <pb n="10" facs="0045"
                            xml:id="pg_10"/>in Asmara has become unpredictable and, therefore, that
                        the security of our military and contract personnel there can no longer be
                        assured.</p>
                    <p>(S) In December 1976 the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> recommended
                        closure of <gloss target="#t_NAVCOMMU_1">NAVCOMMU</gloss>, Asmara subject to
                        establishment of a MYSTIC STAR (Presidential communications support)
                        facility at Tehran, Iran, or another suitable location. This recommendation
                        was made to Secretary Kissinger, who agreed in principle, but the decision
                        on where to relocate the facility was never made.<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4"

                    <p>(S) The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> now recommend that the
                        requirement to establish an alternate, fixed MYSTIC STAR site prior to the
                        closure of <gloss target="#t_NAVCOMMU_1">NAVCOMMU</gloss>, Asmara be
                        rescinded for the following reasons:</p>
                    <p>a. The sole remaining requirement for <gloss target="#t_NAVCOMMU_1"
                            >NAVCOMMU</gloss>, Asmara, is MYSTIC STAR mission support.</p>
                    <p>b. Political instability in Ethiopia has increased to the extent that
                        continued operation of <gloss target="#t_NAVCOMMU_1">NAVCOMMU</gloss>,
                        Asmara solely in support of MYSTIC STAR requirements is no longer
                        warranted.</p>
                    <p>c. The MYSTIC STAR functions now provided by the Asmara site can be assumed
                        by other <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> communications facilities to
                        provide interim, although degraded, support and coverage.</p>
                    <p>d. Diplomatic negotiations with Iran for a permanent alternative MYSTIC STAR
                        site as a precondition to closure of <gloss target="#t_NAVCOMMU_1"
                            >NAVCOMMU</gloss>, Asmara could cause further unwarranted delay.</p>
                    <p>(S) I am fully in accord with the recommendations I have received from the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> and propose to close <gloss
                            target="#t_NAVCOMMU_1">NAVCOMMU</gloss>, Asmara as soon as the Defense
                        Department is relieved of the requirement imposed on it at an earlier date
                        by the White House communications staff.</p>

                    <p>I agree with the views expressed in your memorandum of March 21, 1977, that
                        the Naval Communications Unit, Asmara, be closed.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2"
                            >See <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note> It is my view, and the
                        White House Communications Agency concurs, that the risk to the safety of US
                        personnel created by the situation in Ethiopia outweighs the degradation of
                        communications capability which would accompany the closure of the Kagnew
                        site.</p>
                    <p>Our final withdrawal from Kagnew Station is bound to have political impact
                        upon the Ethiopian military regime which has just suffered a psychologically
                        debilitating defeat in the surrender of Nacfa to Eritrean insurgents. The
                        whole U.S.-Ethiopian relationship has been deteriorating rapidly and there
                        are further pending actions, such as the downgrading of the <gloss
                            target="#t_MAAG_1">MAAG</gloss> group in Ethiopia, of which we will need
                        to inform the Addis Ababa government soon. Since PRM–21 on Ethiopia and the
                        Horn of Africa is nearing completion,<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note> I believe it would be best
                        to defer informing the Addis government of these steps, including the
                        closing of Kagnew, until the policy review process is completed.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, I recommend you take all preparatory measures necessary to
                        implement the closing of Kagnew.</p>

                    <p>The pace of events in the Horn of Africa has accelerated greatly during the
                        past few weeks. Fortunately, we have a PRM exercise on this area nearing
                            completion.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">See <ref target="#d10">Document

                        way things seem to look:</p>
                    <p>• Somalia is upset about Soviet support for the Ethiopian military regime,
                        feels it may be left in the lurch and is looking for ways to lessen its
                        dependence on the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s
                        effort to get the Ethiopians and Somalis together seems to have failed and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> ended up more favorably
                        impressed by the Ethiopians. He found the Somalis, who pressed their
                        longstanding territorial demands on Ethiopia, more irredentist than
                        socialist. The Soviets probably encouraged this <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> reconciliation venture, but unless they do something
                        to assuage Somali feelings, they will lose by it.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3"

                    <p>• An interesting measure of whether things have really changed in Somalia
                        will be what happens to the Cubans there, some of whom have been helping the
                        Somalis mount guerrilla operations into Ethiopia.</p>

                        we believe they may have offered the Somalis up to $300,000,000 to break

                            Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D770056–0825)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>• The Somalis are concerned about how to replace the large-scale aid the
                        Soviets have been giving them. With Saudi money, they would have little
                        difficulty on the economic side, for they could hire European and American
                        technicians. Replacing military aid is much more of a problem, since they
                        are totally Soviet-equipped. While we could probably justify some economic
                        aid ourselves and get Congress to go along, I am skeptical about justifying
                        military aid. We intend to look at this in the PRM.</p>
                    <p>• Even if we find the Somalis warming up to us rapidly, we will have to
                        exercise some caution, for the situation in Ethiopia is very fluid, and we
                        haven’t reached the point where we feel we should give up Ethiopia in
                        exchange for Somalia. We should get as many of our friends and allies to
                        help as possible, not only the Saudis but perhaps the Iranians, the
                        Italians, Germans, Israelis and others.</p>
                    <p>• Finally, there is the fact that Somali irredentism is very deep-seated and
                        affects not only Ethiopia but Kenya. We cannot let the Somalis think we will
                        support their extensive territorial claims against their neighbors,
                        including the <gloss target="#t_TFAI_1">TFAI</gloss> which is slated to
                        become independent in June.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will participate in the discussion which the PRM will
                        generate.</p>

                    <p rend="center">THE ETHIOPIAN REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS</p>
                    <p rend="center">INTRODUCTION AND PRINCIPAL POINTS</p>
                    <p>Since World War II, Ethiopia has been the centerpiece of US policy in the
                        Horn of Africa. The Ethiopian revolution that began in early 1974 as an army
                        mutiny has moved, stage by stage, through a period of “moderate reform,” a
                        period of dispute between revolutionaries over how radical change should be
                        carried out and who should do it, and a period of collegial military rule,
                        to the present essentially one-man-with-advisers regime of Lt. Col.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu Haile-Mariam</persName>. In the
                        process, the Ethiopian government has been transformed from a difficult,
                        occasionally embarrassing, but relatively reliable client of the US into a
                        radical socialist regime struggling to keep control of the country and
                        looking to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Eastern Europe, Cuba,
                        and China for help.</p>
                    <p>The analysis that follows has no specific time frame, but generally the
                        analysts have not tried to look beyond the next two years. The memorandum
                        was requested initially by the Department of State, but has been completed
                        with an eye to the Presidential Review Memorandum/<gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss>–21: The Horn of Africa,<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.</note> which was issued while this
                        paper was in preparation.</p>
                    <p>The principal points of this paper are as follows:</p>
                    <p>—The Ethiopian revolution has produced a serious degradation of political
                        authority throughout the country, but we do not believe that internal
                        resistance in itself will lead to a breakup of the Ethiopian state.</p>
                    <p>—At the same time, the revolution has made it more possible—we think
                        likely—that Eritrea will have de facto independence within the next 12
                        months because of the inadequacy of the military means available to the
                        revolutionary leadership and its unwillingness to compromise its unitary
                        political outlook. We think that some territory in the Ogaden would be lost
                        if and when the Ethiopians take military action to preserve their interests
                        in the French Territory of the Afars and Issas (FTAI).</p>
                    <pb n="15" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_15"/>
                    <p>—With regard to the Afars and Issas, we believe that the odds on a war
                        between Ethiopia and Somalia over this issue are still better than even,
                        despite changes in French policy which appear designed to satisfy Somali
                        demands. The Ethiopians object to these changes, and we think they will make
                        some military demonstration if the postindependence arrangements in the FTAI
                        do not promise to keep the Somalis out.</p>
                    <p>—Internally in Ethiopia, <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        controls the revolutionary council and is accepted by much of the military,
                        but his personal position is not yet stable. He holds this position now
                        primarily because he has physically eliminated rivals; he could himself be
                        similarly removed. The elimination of <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>, however, while it would probably produce some
                        changes in tone and rhetoric, would be followed by a military government
                        with generally similar objectives and basic outlook.</p>
                    <p>—The present leaders, especially <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>, believe that the US Government is unsympathetic,
                        and very possibly hostile, to the Ethiopian revolution. They look to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and China
                        for the specialized help they need in keeping Somalia at bay, securing the
                        revolution, and organizing their internal support, even while they try to
                        maintain a supply line of military materiel from the US. This attitude will
                        persist at least as long as <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        heads the government, and US influence on Ethiopia’s actions is likely to be
                        minimal.</p>
                    <p>—The full extent to which the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will be
                        able to capitalize directly on this situation is not easy to forecast.
                        Fundamentally, the Soviets are certainly attracted by the prospect of
                        developing a new relationship with the largest and potentially most powerful
                        country in the Horn region. But this involves careful management of their
                        relationship with Somalia, and we think that this latter, with the
                        facilities Somalia has provided the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                        will continue to be the focus of Soviet policy in the region.</p>
                    <p>—The Ethiopian leaders are also reaching out to new relationships beyond the
                        Horn—to South Yemen and Libya, for example—and while these particular
                        relationships may well be emphemeral there is a good chance that, in a
                        somewhat longer term, the Ethiopians will be able and will wish to cultivate
                        understandings with the more radical Arab and Third World governments. Over
                        time, this is likely to shrink the relations between Ethiopia and
                        Israel.</p>

                    <p rend="center">ETHIOPIA: A MILITARY ASSESSMENT OF THE ERITREAN INSURGENCY
                        (U)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>(S) The insurgents have seized the initiative in the 15-year-old secessionist
                        war in Ethiopia’s Eritrea Province. Guerrilla sieges of government garrisons
                        have resulted in the abandonment of remote outposts and isolation of others.
                        Moreover, morale among Ethiopian troops in the area has deteriorated
                        seriously. The military government’s response to these challenges has been
                        to increase the size of its force in Eritrea to more than 25,000.</p>
                    <p>(S) Insurgent forces are divided into three movements whose combined strength
                        is about 12,000 to 15,000 armed regulars. These groups have grown rapidly
                        during the past two years, due largely to the government’s harsh policies.
                        Both internal and external backing appear sufficient to support the growing
                        insurrection, although there are some indications of instability in the flow
                        of resources—funds, small arms, and training—from the major benefactors in
                        the Arab world. In response to Arab pressures, the three insurgent groups
                        are now engaged in unification efforts which, if successful, will enhance
                        their military capabilities.</p>
                    <p>(S) The outlook for the foreseeable future is for continued deterioration of
                        Addis Ababa’s military posture in Eritrea. However, Ethiopia’s capacity to
                        defend the main military centers in the province is formidable, so, barring
                        a psychological blow that precipitates a chain reaction among government
                        troops, a sudden insurgent victory is unlikely. While there is appreciable
                        potential for sharp shifts in Ethiopia’s political situation, the most
                        probable near-future pattern in Eritrea is a continuation of present trends.
                        The guerrillas are expected to consolidate their hold on the countryside and
                        peripheral towns, and the government forces will concentrate in the larger
                        centers.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this study is to examine policy options open to the U.S. to
                        advance or protect our interests in the Horn of Africa/Red Sea area. Due to
                        the rapid pace of developments in Ethiopia and the need for early decisions
                        concerning that country, this study will focus primarily on Ethiopia and
                        adjustments in U.S. policy suggested by developments there. The study
                        alludes in general terms to the resultant implications for Sudan, Somalia
                        and other countries in the area, but detailed study of these implications
                        must await decisions on our Ethiopian policy and on our conventional arms

                            >USSR</gloss> for influence in Africa has been superimposed on the
                        welter of ethnic, religious, ideological, and territorial incompatibilities
                        existing between, among and within the African states of the Horn of

                    <p>Our interest in maintaining cooperative relations with and promoting
                        stability among countries in any area of the world has acquired the added
                        dimension in the Horn of Africa of big power competition. Moscow’s efforts
                        to displace the U.S. as the dominant foreign influence in Ethiopia are
                        causing concern among moderate states in the region, notably Sudan and Saudi
                        Arabia, and disenchantment toward the Soviets on the part of Somalia. We
                        accordingly have an opportunity to advance U.S. influence in the region as a
                        whole by consolidating our position in neighboring countries now friendly to
                        us, e.g., Sudan and Kenya, and in advancing our position in Somalia.</p>
                    <pb n="18" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_18"/>
                    <p>Given the unlikelihood that present leftward trends in Ethiopia can be
                        arrested, we must accept over the short term a decreased U.S. influence in
                        that country and adjust our programs accordingly. The instability of the
                        present Ethiopian regime, however, raises the presently remote possibility
                        of its replacement over the medium or longer term by a leadership more
                        amenable to cooperative relations with the U.S. This prospect, plus the fact
                        that Ethiopia is the second-most-populous country in Africa, gives us an
                        interest in so tailoring our policies that we are in a position insofar as
                        possible to capitalize on possible future developments favoring a resumption
                        of closer Ethio-US ties. With that in mind, any improvement in our relations
                        with Somalia and Sudan should stop short of activities perceived as hostile
                        toward Ethiopia as a nation. The same consideration suggests that, while we
                        have no present interest in obstructing Eritrean autonomy or independence,
                        or in opposing dissidents within Ethiopia proper, we equally have no
                        interest in becoming involved with groups in Eritrea or with opposition
                        elements in Ethiopia in ways which would compromise our ability to have a
                        cooperative relationship with a successor regime in Addis Ababa.</p>
                    <p>Militarily the Horn is not of great strategic importance to the U.S.<note

                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> disagrees on this point. It holds
                            that U.S. interests in the Horn are chiefly strategic, reflecting the
                            area’s proximity to Middle East oil fields, the sea oil routes and the
                            Red Sea passage to the Mediterranean. The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> views with concern the continuing expansion of Soviet
                            facilities and presence in Somalia and inroads elsewhere in the Horn.
                            The U.S. seeks regional stability and evolutionary developments in an
                            area environment congenial to U.S. goals. [Footnote is in the
                            original.]</note> The psychological perceptions of area states aside,
                        interdiction of Red Sea and Indian Ocean maritime routes is not likely short
                        of a limited war situation, although an increased Soviet presence can limit
                        our freedom of action. The Indian Ocean <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>
                        occupies a low priority in terms of the global strategic balance.
                        Nonetheless, restriction of Soviet military access to the area would be in
                        our interest as contributing to a reduction of major power military presence
                        there. It could also complicate Soviet ability to use naval power to project
                        political influence in the Indian Ocean littoral. We do have an interest in
                        maximizing U.S. access to ports and airfields in the area.</p>
                    <p>Our concern for human rights gives us an interest in preventing the U.S. from
                        being implicated in human rights violations by recipients of our assistance,
                        which is particularly pertinent in the case of Ethiopia. Our concern for the
                        poor gives us a humanitarian interest in the area. We have an interest in
                        the safety of Americans residing in the area whose welfare could be affected
                        by developments there including actions of ours.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">B.</hi> Soviet Interests:</p>
                    <p>For two years the Soviets hesitated to take advantage of the opportunity
                        which was presented to them by the accession to power of a leftist
                        government in Ethiopia. They had to weigh the risks to their position in
                        Somalia of support for Ethiopia, which offers no military-strategic
                        advantages for their Indian Ocean interests equal to those they derive from
                        their Somali facilities. On the other hand, they had to consider the
                        politico-strategic advantages of replacing the U.S. as the dominant foreign
                        influence in Ethiopia. Hopeful that such a move would be generally perceived
                        as representing a trend of Soviet gains in Africa at U.S. expense, the
                        Soviets might also view it as placing them in a position to exert pressure
                        on Sudan and Kenya. While Soviet pre-eminence in Ethiopia would not
                        substantially enhance their ability to interdict the Red Sea maritime route
                        beyond their Somalia-based capability, it could provide them with some
                        leverage against countries reliant on that route, particularly oil suppliers
                        and consumers.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet agreement in December 1976 to supply Ethiopia with substantial
                        military equipment, and to encourage other European Communist countries to
                        provide arms aid, presumably represented a Soviet conclusion that the risks
                        to their position in Somalia were manageable.<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">In
                            telegram 12584 from Addis Ababa, December 29, 1976, the Embassy reported
                            on the Soviet agreement to provide military assistance to Ethiopia.
                            (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D760474–0980)</note> A token delivery of small arms took place in
                        February, and additional deliveries are reported to have been made in March.
                        However, until significant deliveries have taken place, the Soviets will
                        presumably remain in a position to reverse their course.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet ability to deploy naval and air units into the Indian Ocean for
                        surveillance of U.S., French and other allied shipping, for projecting
                        military influence along the Indian Ocean littoral, and for exerting some
                        psychological pressure on tanker routes from the Persian Gulf is facilitated
                        by the availability of Somali ports and airfields. These goals could be
                        achieved without use of the Somali facilities, but at some expense.
                        Undoubtedly, the Soviets are now watching the Somali reaction closely and
                        will, in the light of that reaction, review the relative importance to them
                        of Ethiopia and Somalia prior to any large-scale deliveries that commit them
                        to the Ethiopian option and risk Somali imposition of restrictions on Soviet
                        use of military facilities in Somalia.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their attempts to mollify the Somali reaction, efforts

                        to choose between Somalia and Ethiopia, the choice of the latter will not
                        leave them committed to a disintegrating asset. East European arms offers to
                        the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> and Cuban expressions of
                        willingness to help arm and train the Peoples’ Militia in Ethiopia and also
                        to be of help in Eritrea are undoubtedly seen by the Soviets as supportive
                        of that option.</p>
                    <p>Soviet and Cuban support for the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>,
                        particularly in Eritrea, could be justified to most African states as an
                        effort to defend the sacred <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> principle
                        of preserving African territorial integrity. Having in mind that the
                        dispatch of Cuban combat troops to Ethiopia could nonetheless cause an
                        adverse reaction in some African and Arab states and in the U.S., could
                        embroil Cuba in another Angola-type situation from which it would be
                        difficult to extricate themselves, and might turn out to be a commitment to
                        a losing cause, the Cubans would probably prefer to confine themselves to an
                        advisory role. However, once involved, they could come under <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> pressure, and possibly Soviet as well,
                        to introduce combat troops as the only way to bolster sagging Ethiopian

                        assassinated in 1974. Since then, indiscriminate and brutal
                        counter-insurgency attacks by Ethiopian troops have embittered the Eritreans
                        and swelled the ranks of the secessionists, who have been receiving support
                        not only from Iraq and Syria but also from more moderate Arab states,
                        including Saudi Arabia. Secessionists now control the countryside and
                        Ethiopian forces, confined to the main towns, are forced to rely on air
                        drops and heavily armed convoys to maintain the flow of supplies. Although
                        divided into three different groups, the secessionists’ bitterness toward
                        Ethiopia, their battlefield gains, and their widening support are making
                        them less and less inclined to accept a settlement short of independence.
                        While the tide of battle now favors them, leading to the U.S. intelligence

                    <p>Somalia depends on the Soviets for virtually all its military supplies and
                        equipment. It also relies on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for
                        some economic aid. Given the unrest and tensions in the Horn, Somalia is
                        loath to take any step which might weaken it militarily. Somalia’s
                        bureaucracy and its military/security apparatus are permeated with Soviet
                        advisors. Like the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>, Somalia’s
                        leadership has a legitimacy problem, having overthrown an elected
                        government, and has sought a similar method of solving it by espousing
                        “scientific socialism” as the best path for realizing the people’s will for
                        a better life. A Leninist-style party apparatus has been created in Somalia,
                        formal links have been established between it and the Soviet Communist
                        Party, a Soviet-Somali Friendship Treaty has been concluded, and Somali
                        President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has gone out of his
                        way to praise the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and to parrot
                        Soviet policy lines.</p>
                    <p>All of this would make it difficult for Somalia to effect a dramatic
                        reduction of the Soviet presence there should it wish to do so. However, the
                        prospect of a major Soviet military supply relationship with their Ethiopian
                        foe has caused the Somalis to consider whether it might be in their national
                        interest to readjust their relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, and with the U.S., if that can be accomplished without

                        leadership position and is otherwise made worth their while.</p>
                    <p>No Somali leader can disavow the dream of a Greater Somalia—an area including
                        Djibouti, the northeastern portion of Kenya and the Ogaden of Ethiopia, all
                        of which are inhabited by ethnic Somalis. However, particularly since the
                        present Somali Government derives its power not from demonstrated popular
                        consent but from its control of an extensive security apparatus, the
                        survival of the Somali leadership does not require it to work actively, let
                        alone take risks, for the achievement of that dream. Nonetheless, failure to
                        seize opportunities to advance that goal or to retaliate against those seen
                        to be conniving against it could be costly to a Somali leader.</p>

                    <p>While the threat of Somali military moves against Djibouti <hi rend="italic"
                            >per se</hi> has thus diminished, there is still a possibility that
                        Somalia will attempt to capitalize on Ethiopia’s state of confusion to
                        encroach further into the Ethiopian Ogaden. That region supplies a vital
                        link in the annual transhumance life-pattern of many Somali nomads whose
                        home areas are in Somalia. The Ogaden thus represents a socio-economic prize
                        for Mogadiscio that transcends mere ethnic sentiment. Additionally, it is
                        the home area for President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s
                        Merrehan clan. A Somali feint towards Djibouti to draw off Ethiopian forces
                        and thus facilitate a move into the Ogaden, where Somalia-backed guerrillas
                        are already active, cannot be ruled out.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of Ethiopian-Somali conflict over Djibouti can be lessened to
                        some extent by international focus on the territory. Continued UN and <gloss

                        respect, as will official representation in Djibouti by Egypt, Saudi Arabia
                        and the U.S. If current bickerings among the Djibouti political groups and
                        with the French can be resolved and elections successfully held on May 8,
                        the June 27 independence date may be met. Rapid admission to the <gloss

                        will help the independent government gain legitimacy, as will prompt
                        admission to the UN and the Arab League, the opening of foreign embassies in
                        Djibouti, and the start of foreign aid programs (e.g., by the U.S. and Saudi
                        Arabia) to supplement French aid efforts. While the Soviets retain their use
                        of Somali military facilities and are advancing their position in Ethiopia,
                        it will be in their interest to counsel both these countries against
                        conflict over Djibouti or the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>Over the short term, the most effective deterrent to Somali or Ethiopian
                        overt aggression in Djibouti will be a substantial French military presence.
                        Pressure for the removal of French troops will undoubtedly increase after
                        independence. While the French may be able to withstand external pressures,
                        since their continued military presence will be based on the request of the
                        new Republic of Djibouti, domestic pressure in France would mount if French
                        troops suffered casualties either in repelling aggression or, more likely,
                        in terrorist attacks.</p>
                    <p>It is not certain that an independent Djibouti will want to become part of
                        Greater Somalia, which would risk a violent Ethiopian reaction. The Afars
                        would clearly not be interested in such a move. The Issas, a clan of
                        Somalis, has maintained a degree of aloofness from other Somali clans and
                        might therefore be less inclined than others to respond to the call for
                        ethnic unity. Djibouti’s leaders recognize the territory’s dependence on the
                        Ethiopian transit trade, may not be attracted by Somalia’s “scientific
                        socialism”, and might be disinclined to forego the perquisites of office in
                        an independent Djibouti government. Saudi <pb n="25" facs="0060"

                    <p>Following a period of flirtation with the Soviets which ended in 1971 as a
                        result of a short-lived takeover of the government by the Sudanese Communist
                        Party, the Sudanese have sought friendship and cooperation with the West and
                        with neighboring and moderate Arab states, notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
                        These latter look upon Sudan, with its immense agricultural potential, as
                        the future breadbasket of the Middle East and also as a buffer against
                        hostile advances by Soviet-supported regimes, e.g., Ethiopia and Libya.</p>
                    <p>Sudan, Yemen Arab Republic, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are all alarmed at the
                        potential threat to their security and to the security of the Red Sea posed
                        by Soviet advances in the Horn of Africa. To contain that threat, they are
                        undertaking initiatives designed to facilitate self-determination—preferably
                        independence—in an Eritrea which would be induced to hew to an
                        anti-Communist path by Saudi money. They are also attempting to use
                        Somalia’s disenchantment with Soviet military supplies to Ethiopia, plus the
                        carrot of substantial Saudi financial aid, to woo Somalia away from the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Sudanese-US relations, previously cool, have improved markedly in the past
                        year. The U.S. has agreed to provide <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                            >PL–480</gloss> food aid and to resume an economic aid program. In the
                        security field, the U.S. has agreed to provide equipment and training to
                        give Sudan a secure communications net and monitoring capability, Sudan has
                        been declared eligible for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>, Sudanese
                        military personnel have been accepted for training in the U.S., and a

                        advance notice given to the Congress on January 19. A decision on the
                        C–130’s has not yet been taken by the present Administration.</p>
                    <p>The Sudan’s major internal problem, the struggle between the Arab/Moslem
                        north and black African/Christian south, has abated. The north-south
                        division is still, however, susceptible to occasional flare-ups, and the
                        regime’s stability is further threatened from within by tribal, ideological
                        and religious dissidence, notably from members of the banned Communist party
                        and the Ansar religious sect, many of whose members were driven into exile
                        primarily in Ethiopia following an uprising in 1971.</p>
                    <p>Libyan hostility to the Sudan, stemming from a complex of motivations ranging
                        from Qadafi’s personal dislike of Nimeiri to his desire to put pressure on
                        Egypt through the Sudan, has taken the form of aiding and abetting
                        dissidents within and exiled from the Sudan, nota<pb n="26" facs="0061"
                            xml:id="pg_26"/>bly the Ansars. In his efforts to unseat Nimeiri, Qadafi
                        has enlisted Ethiopian help for the arming and training of Sudanese in exile
                        there. Ethiopia’s willingness to cooperate with Libya derives both from a
                        desire to halt Libyan aid to the Eritrean insurgents and from anger at
                        Nimeiri for permitting Ethiopian exiles and Eritrean secessionists to mount
                        operations against Ethiopia from Sudanese territory. At the turn of the
                        year, the deterioration of Ethio-Sudanese relations erupted into mutual
                        public denunciations by the two countries’ leaders. This led Nimeiri to
                        abandon his previous public neutrality on the Eritrean question, which had
                        placed him in a position to moderate between the Eritreans and the
                        Ethiopians, and he publicly announced Sudan’s support for the cause of
                        Eritrean independence.</p>
                    <p>Given its internal opponents and, especially, its hostile neighbors, Sudan’s
                        concern for its security is well founded.</p>
                    <pb n="27" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_27"/>
                    <p>In these circumstances, Sudan finds it difficult to reconcile U.S. assurances
                        of friendship and support for the Sudan with the continuation of U.S. arms
                        supplies to Ethiopia, and difficult to understand U.S. hesitation to act
                        favorably on Sudan’s request for C–130 aircraft and unwillingness to give
                        consideration to other Sudanese military requests. These views are shared by
                        the Egyptians and by the Saudis, the latter being prepared to finance
                        military purchases to enhance Sudanese security.</p>

                    <p>The immediate Kenyan concern with respect to the Horn of Africa is the effect
                        developments there may have on Kenya’s Somali-inhabited Northeast Province.
                        It is in Kenya’s interest for Somalia’s irredentism to remain focussed on
                        the Ogaden and Djibouti, since the Kenyans believe that Somali eyes will
                        turn toward Kenya if the Ogaden and Djibouti issues were to be settled to
                        Somali satisfaction. The perceived Somali threat induced Kenya in 1963 to
                        enter into a still valid mutual defense treaty with Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the territorial threat from Somalia, the Kenyans must also worry
                        about post-<persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName> threats to the
                        very character of their society and its moderate foreign policy orientation.
                        While all of the likely successors have a stake in the continuation of
                        Kenya’s current domestic and foreign policies, virtually all of its
                        neighbors, and the Soviets, hope to see those policies changed. A protracted
                        struggle over <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName>’s succession
                        will present an opportunity to external elements desirous of altering
                        Kenya’s policies. Indeed, realization of this possibility by the Kenyan
                        contenders may well facilitate a smooth transition. But even if the
                        succession issue is resolved quickly and smoothly, any successor government
                        will initially have less self-confidence and authority than the redoubtable
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName> and will thus be more
                        vulnerable to outside influence.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, the discomfort Kenya has felt since Haile Selassie’s
                        overthrow regarding its association with leftist Ethiopia can only grow as
                        the Soviet position there strengthens and <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss>-Cuban ties increase. The worst case for Kenya would be a
                        successful effort by the Soviets to achieve dominance in Ethiopia while
                        retaining their position in Somalia. Probably the best Kenya can hope for as
                        matters are now moving is that a reduction of Soviet influence in Somalia
                        might make Somalia more amenable to reaching some form of accommodation with
                        Kenya.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">I.</hi> Israeli Interests:</p>
                    <p>The Israelis are seriously concerned about developments in the Horn of
                        Africa—specifically in Ethiopia and Djibouti. Their primary interest is to
                        prevent an alignment of Arab strength in this area that could further
                        isolate Israel and place it at a geopolitical disadvantage. They also seek
                        to limit Soviet influence in that area, which they perceive as increasing in
                        strength. Diplomatic relations between Ethiopia and Israel have remained
                        broken since 1973, but an informal link exists in the form of Israeli
                        training for Ethiopian elite divisions and Israeli support for Somali exile
                        groups opposed to the <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>
                        government. The Israeli interest in maintaining this link derives from the
                        centuries-old antipathy between Ethiopia and Arabs in general and Israel’s
                        desire for influence with at least one country having Red Sea frontage.</p>
                    <p>In our view, interdiction of the Red Sea maritime route does not, of course,
                        require control of the entire littoral. Nor, in the absence of an Israeli
                        base in the southern portion of the Red Sea, does a position of some
                        influence in Ethiopia materially enhance Israeli capability to counter a
                        blockade. Furthermore, Israeli oil reserves are sufficient to withstand the
                        effects of a blockade for six months, beyond which a blockade is unlikely to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, the prospect of further hostile influence in the Red Sea area,
                        whether Arab or Soviet, increases the potential threat of a blockade of a
                        route on which Israel depends heavily not only for its Iranian oil supplies
                        but for its important trade and communications with Asia and Africa.
                        Anything which threatens to increase Israeli isolation is of genuine concern
                        to them, and in the context of our relations with Israel and our objectives
                        in the Middle East, to us as well.</p>
                    <p>Growing Soviet, Cuban and Libyan ties with the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss> make the Israelis increasingly uncomfortable with the
                        situation in Ethiopia and might force them to alter their estimate of Lt.
                        Col. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> as being a nationalist
                        rather than a dedicated Marxist. They will nonetheless probably still be
                        desirous of keeping a minimal tie with Ethiopia on the theory that an enemy
                        of the Arabs can be an Israeli friend, and will probably continue to urge
                        the U.S. to maintain its ties and assistance <pb n="28" facs="0063"

                        They will also urge the exercise of U.S. influence to lessen the possibility

                        Communist donor of economic aid to Ethiopia and, although unable to compete

                        demonstrating commonality with the Africans on major North-South issues and

                        option would entail:</p>
                    <p>—approval of the full $47 million ammunition purchase request outstanding
                        from the Ethiopians;</p>
                    <p>—renewal of our offer of a $10 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                        credit using <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1977 funds;</p>
                    <p>—continue our grant <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> training
                        program;</p>
                    <p>—delivery of all military items in the pipeline for delivery in 1977 and 1978
                        (these include 14 M–60 tanks, 49 armored personnel carriers, 20 106mm
                        jeep-mounted recoilless rifles, 8 F–5E aircraft, 6 patrol boats, and radar
                        equipment);</p>
                    <p>—continued readiness to consider <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cash
                        and commercial requests for defense articles, consistent with our overall
                        arms transfer policy;</p>
                    <p>—reiteration of our economic aid project proposals to which the <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> has not yet responded as an earnest of
                        our willingness to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>
                        efforts to reach their social reform goals;</p>
                    <p>—maintaining our information service activities.</p>
                    <p>This option would put us in the best position either to capitalize on any
                        small changes in the situation operating to our advantage or to place the
                        blame for any further deterioration on the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss>. Our continued substantial presence might help to sustain
                        the morale of Ethiopians who are oriented toward the West and who oppose the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> regime. It would enable
                        us to claim that we had, for our part, gone as far as we could to maintain
                        our old supportive relationship with Ethiopia despite revolutionary changes
                        and unfounded provocations, thereby demonstrating that we are prepared to
                        work with Socialist regimes in Africa. It could inhibit a completely free
                        hand for the <pb n="30" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_30"/>Soviets and could
                        prevent those opposed to the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> from
                        feeling abandoned by the U.S. to a Communist fate. It would continue some
                        Ethiopian dependence on the U.S. for arms and give us, particularly with the
                        option of phasing deliveries against good behavior, some potential leverage
                        on <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> performance. The Kenyans might see
                        it as mitigating the pressure which might otherwise be exerted on their
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName> situation and the
                        Israelis would applaud it.</p>
                    <p>Choice of this option would not have the effect of maintaining our presence
                        at its present level. Whether or not this option is chosen, we have already
                        pulled out our Peace Corps volunteers and have announced an end to grant
                        materiel military aid, in part because of Ethiopian human rights violations.
                        We are proceeding with plans to close our communications facility at Kagnew
                        Station, reduce our <gloss target="#t_MAAG_1">MAAG</gloss> from 46 to 21,
                        replace the present Brigadier General <gloss target="#t_MAAG_1">MAAG</gloss>
                        chief with a Colonel, and move the <gloss target="#t_MAAG_1">MAAG</gloss>
                        from its present quarters to smaller offices in the Embassy compound. All of
                        these pending actions can be explained as dictated by extra-Ethiopian
                        considerations but will still be interpreted as signalling a downgrading of
                        our interest in Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>On the negative side, continued U.S. arms sales to the <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> would be judged by the Sudanese, other
                        moderate Arabs, Ethiopian opponents of the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss>, and the Eritreans as misguided if not unfriendly support
                        to their Ethiopian adversaries. The Somalis would view it in the same light
                        and would question whether an improvement in their relations with the U.S.
                        was in their interest. Its major effect on the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss> would be to minimize any degradation in their military
                        strength and, consequently, their ability to maintain themselves in power
                        while they were in the process of converting from U.S. to Communist arms
                        suppliers. We might well find that the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss>, after we had approved their full request, would reduce it
                        by those elements they were able to secure from Communist sources, accepting
                        from the U.S. only those items not obtainable elsewhere. It would convince
                        the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> that they can with impunity
                        ignore U.S. concerns and still get from the U.S. all they want. The <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> could continue to ignore our economic
                        aid proposals, leaving us in the position of spurned suitor. Our arms
                        supplies would continue our association with a government which we have
                        publicly identified as a violator of basic human rights and provide them
                        with the wherewithal to continue those violations.</p>
                    <p>This option may not, in fact, be available to us in this form. Not only may
                        the Ethiopians turn down part or all of our offer because of having found
                        other sources of supply, but also this option is incompatible with stated
                        Administration desires to reduce the worldwide arms traffic and could well
                        meet stiff Congressional opposition.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">B.</hi> Option 2: Terminate our military relationship.</p>
                    <p>We could inform the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> that, as a result
                        of our review of our world-wide arms transfer policy, we are unable
                        hereafter to provide military supplies, equipment or training to Ethiopia.
                        This would best be done after we had established and publicized the criteria
                        which will henceforth govern our willingness to provide arms to foreign
                        countries, enabling us to emphasize those factors which make Ethiopia as
                        well as other countries no longer eligible to receive U.S. arms. If
                        completion of our arms transfer policy review is likely to be protracted
                        beyond the point when we feel action one way or the other must be taken on
                        the year-old Ethiopian ammunition request, we could inform the <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> that, while our arms transfer policy is
                        still under review, the trend of the review makes it most unlikely that
                        Ethiopia will henceforth be found eligible to receive U.S. arms supplies and
                        they should accordingly make other arrangements for all military supplies,
                        equipment and training which they have expected from us.</p>
                    <p>—Full implementation of this option would entail reimbursing the <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> for progress payments already made on
                        pipeline items, cancellation of commercial sales arrangements for which
                        delivery has not been effected, and termination of training already in
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>—We could indicate that, while our military relationship with Ethiopia is
                        thus coming to an end, we are still hopeful of being able to contribute to
                        Ethiopia’s social reforms and economic development through our <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>—We could indicate our desire to continue our cultural interchange with the
                        Ethiopian people through our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>This option would cause a hostile <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>
                        reaction. It could lead to a virulent propaganda campaign which might
                        trigger a wave of violent anti-Americanism in Addis Ababa and other urban
                        centers, endangering the approximately 1,000 American citizens living in
                        Ethiopia, particularly those connected with the U.S. military and other
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> activities. It would, accordingly,
                        be prudent to reduce the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> official
                        presence prior to such an announcement.</p>
                    <p>This option would also be likely to result in the termination by the <gloss
                            target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> of other <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> programs, possibly even stimulating them to break relations
                        with us. This latter eventuality would deprive us of access to the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and ECA headquarters in Addis Ababa. This
                        option would deprive us of useful contact that we now enjoy in such sectors
                        as the military, the academic community and elsewhere. It would cause the
                            <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> to press the Soviets and other
                        Communist suppliers to accelerate arms deliveries and possibly to undertake
                        other measures to bolster Ethiopian security.</p>
                    <p>All of Ethiopia’s neighbors, with the possible exception of Kenya, would
                        applaud this decision. The Sudan, in particular, would be <pb n="32"
                            facs="0067" xml:id="pg_32"/>pleased. However, once significant Soviet
                        arms had arrived in Ethiopia, the Sudanese would argue that this enhanced
                        the danger to their security and would redouble their efforts to secure from
                        us not only the already formally requested C–130 aircraft but also F–5’s,
                        armored personnel carriers and other arms. Kenya might also seek additional
                        arms from us. The Somalis would be encouraged to believe that a sharp
                        reduction by them of Soviet activities in Somalia would merit military and
                        economic rewards for them arranged or blessed by the U.S. The Somalis might
                        also be tempted by such a U.S. decision to move on Djibouti and/or the
                        Ogaden although their assumptions about the extent of Ethiopia’s existing
                        arms stocks, their knowledge of their own short supply situation and
                        dependence on the Soviets for logistics and resupply would give them pause.
                        Also, the Somalis know that they can probably dominate Djibouti politically
                        in any case.</p>
                    <p>Internally, this option would embolden the Eritrean secessionists and further
                        demoralize the Ethiopian troops in that province, possibly leading to, at
                        least temporarily, a successful break-away of Eritrea. It might stimulate
                        additional defections of Ethiopian military personnel to the <gloss

                        It could conceivably stimulate conflict between rival factions in the
                        Ethiopian military and could lead to <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>’s overthrow and replacement by individuals more
                        inclined to cooperate with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>This option would help to disassociate us from <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"

                    <p>This option would essentially maintain our present military supply
                        relationship but respond only partially to the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                            >EPMG</gloss> ammunition request. It would buy us time to proceed with
                        an orderly reduction of American citizens resident in Ethiopia in an
                        atmosphere less inclined than Option 2 to generate anti-American violence.
                        It could provide us with some potential leverage on the <gloss

                        failure on their part to take account of U.S. interests will not be without
                        cost to them. The Somalis, Sudanese and other advocates of an end to our

                        might be prevailed upon to see it as a measured response moving in the

                        nothing more than a continuation of past patterns, and the message and
                        leverage would thereby be lost. It would in any case provide the <gloss

                        their conversion to Communist suppliers.</p>
                    <p>Opposition in Congress to this option might be lessened if it were presented
                        as a further step toward reducing our military relationship with Ethiopia
                        and facilitating an orderly phase-down of our operations in that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>This option would lessen but not end charges of U.S. implication in <gloss

                        Relationship</p>
                    <p>We should finally consider an option aimed at bringing to an end our arms
                        supply relationship but in a manner less abrupt than Option 2. Under this
                        option, we would acknowledge to the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>
                        our awareness of their desire to diversify their sources of arms and their
                        progress toward that goal. We would state that this goal accords with our
                        own desire to phase down our military relationship with Ethiopia, a desire
                        based on our human rights concerns and our distaste at the degree of our
                        association with their efforts to solve the Eritrean problem by force rather
                        than negotiations. We would indicate our hope that our future relationship
                        with Ethiopia will henceforth concentrate on economic development. We would
                        inform them that, to this end, we will:</p>

                        though on a reduced scale;</p>
                    <p>—no longer be able to supply them with major defense equipment items,
                        including those now in the pipeline, for which we will reimburse them for
                        progress payments with interest (this will be likely to entail serious legal
                        problems and financial penalties for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss>);</p>
                    <p>—be willing to continue on-going <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                        projects, to rapidly implement project proposals already presented to but
                        not yet approved by the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>, and be
                        prepared to expand our <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program even
                        further;</p>
                    <p>—maintain our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>This option would reduce our military relationship to the lowest level
                        susceptible of acceptance by the <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>,
                        given the likelihood that some of the ammunition items would be extremely
                        difficult if not impossible to find substitutes for elsewhere. It would
                        lessen the punitive impact of Option 2 by indicating a willingness on our
                        part to cooperate with and facilitate <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>
                        efforts to shift to more ideologically compatible arms suppliers, without
                        leaving them bereft at a time of difficulty.</p>
                    <p>This option would, like Option 3, give us time for an orderly reduction of
                        the resident American population. It would lessen the risk in the Option 2
                        approach of a break in relations, but would, if accepted, leave us with at
                        least a skeleton military aid presence and a substantial economic aid
                        mission. It would be welcomed by the Sudan and Somalia as a substantial step
                        away from a U.S. arms relationship with their Ethiopian foe but would be
                        less likely than Option 2 to stimulate the destabilizing perception of an
                        arms imbalance in the area. It would be less likely than Option 2 to give
                        the Somalis the impression that we are eager to transfer virtually all of
                        our Ethiopian eggs into the Somali basket, giving them an undesirable degree
                        of leverage in the process of readjusting our relationship. It would be
                        welcomed by the Kenyans and the Israelis as designed to maintain a U.S.
                        presence in Ethiopia. It would demonstrate to others dependent on U.S. arms
                        supplies a measure of U.S. reliability despite considerable provocation. It
                        would significantly ease our degree of association with Ethiopian human
                        rights violations and would encourage internal opponents of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> regime.</p>
                    <p>Our refusal to deliver major equipment items already contracted and partially
                        paid for would subject us to the charge of bad faith and <pb n="35"
                            facs="0070" xml:id="pg_35"/>would carry the risk, if reduced, of a break
                        in relations and danger to American citizens. It seems unlikely that the
                            <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>, denied what they most want from
                        us, the major military items, will be any more amenable than in the past to
                        a continued let alone enhanced role for us in their economic development
                        plans. It would be likely to result in the cessation of our <gloss

                        <hi rend="roman">IV.</hi> U.S. Policy in Other Countries in the Region</p>
                    <p>Since we have to assume that the U.S. position in Ethiopia will continue to
                        decline over the short term and that our choice among the above options will
                        only either slow or accelerate that process, our actions toward other
                        countries in the regions will be only marginally affected by that choice.
                        However, if the inevitable reduction of our position in Ethiopia is to be
                        turned to a net U.S. advantage in the Horn region, we must consider actions
                        available to us to consolidate and advance our position in neighboring
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Sudan’s concern for its security (shared by Egypt and Saudi Arabia) will
                        remain high whatever we do in Ethiopia. Our willingness to proceed with the
                        C–130 sale, to go beyond that in the military field and to provide the kind
                        of social and economic development aid which will broaden the support base
                        for the Nimeiri regime could all contribute to the stability of the regime,
                        the confidence of the Sudanese, Egyptians and Saudis, and our position in
                        the area. We will have to decide which of these elements of support, and to
                        what extent, are compatible with our arms transfer concerns and with
                        Congressional and Israeli tolerance, or whether our interests in the Sudan
                        override those concerns and merit a major U.S. commitment of support.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Somalia, we have to decide whether a relationship with us
                        close enough to end or drastically restrict Soviet operations from Somali
                        military facilities is (a) possible, in view of the degree of Somali
                        entanglement with the Soviets, and (b) important enough to us and likely to
                        be sufficiently durable to warrant a positive response from us to Somali
                        military and economic aid requests.</p>
                    <p>If convinced that the Somalis are genuinely prepared to reduce their Soviet
                        ties significantly, the Saudis have indicated that they are prepared to make
                        such a move financially worth the Somalis’ while. We should consult with the
                        Saudis to determine what specific changes in behavior towards, on the one
                        hand, the Soviets, and, on the other, Western and pro-Western countries, are
                        deserving of what degree of Saudi financial reward. If the Somalis are
                        prepared to move to a point where a cut-off of Soviet military support seems
                        likely, at which point the Saudis would presumably be willing to be generous
                        with finances, we must then determine whether Somali replacement of Soviet
                        by American arms is sufficiently worth our while for a Presidential deter<pb
                            n="36" facs="0071" xml:id="pg_36"/>mination to be made that Somalia is
                        eligible for the Foreign Military Sales program or for us to agree to permit
                        commercial arms purchases by Somalia.</p>
                    <p>If it is determined that the politico-military strategic considerations with
                        respect to Somalia are not sufficiently important to warrant a breach of the
                        Administration’s policy of limiting U.S. arms transfers, we would have to
                        decide if the use of our good offices on Somalia’s behalf with other Western
                        arms suppliers would satisfy the Somali security requirements. In any case,
                        we are preparing an offer of economic aid and we should actively study other
                        ways of improving relations with Somalia.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Djibouti, in addition to continuing to counsel restraint in
                        both Mogadiscio and Addis Ababa and urging the Soviets to do likewise, we
                        should approach other African states, particularly in Francophone Africa, to
                        suggest that they undertake more active measures to defuse the situation,
                        including considering the possibility of establishing resident diplomatic
                        missions.</p>
                    <p>While Option 2 could stimulate the Kenyans to seek additional military aid,
                        Kenya’s absorptive capacity for such aid is likely to be close to its upward
                        limit with current <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> efforts to upgrade
                        Kenya’s ground force capability and U.S. provision of F–5 aircraft and
                        related training. It may be more pertinent to consider what U.S. action
                        might be most appropriate and effective in facilitating a smooth succession,
                        thereby reducing the opportunities for Soviet or other mischief, and to
                        enhance Kenyan confidence in the post-<persName corresp="#p_KJ_1"
                            >Kenyatta</persName> period.</p>
                    <p>We should keep in mind the fact that all of the present contenders are people
                        we can work with comfortably, they all have an interest in a smooth, rapid
                        transition, and the Kenya military is probably the least politicized armed
                        force in Africa and has a stake in the country’s stability and prosperity.
                        We should also bear in mind that the major vulnerability of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName> regime has been the charge of
                        corruption: such charges against a successor to <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1"
                            >Kenyatta</persName> could have politically fatal consequences. Under
                        the circumstances, it would seem desirable for us to avoid political action
                        which, if revealed, would increase the vulnerability of our chosen
                        candidates and add to pressures for repudiation or a reduction of the
                        US-Kenya tie. We should consider whether the most useful action for us under
                        the circumstances might not be assurances to all the Kenyan contenders that
                        we are prepared to be at least as forthcoming with our support for the new
                        Kenya leadership which succeeds <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1"
                            >Kenyatta</persName> as we have been towards his government.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Current Situation:</hi> The meeting reviewed current
                        intelligence on the area which indicates that the military regime in
                        Ethiopia is becoming more brutal and more beleaguered. Ethiopian forces are
                        losing ground steadily to the Eritreans in the north and in the northwest to
                        an exile movement called the Ethiopian Democratic Union. Both elements enjoy
                        Sudanese support. The intelligence community continues to estimate that the
                        military regime can maintain itself in Addis Ababa for an indefinite period
                        of time, but an assassination or coup is always possible. There is some
                        disagreement as to what kind of a government would follow the overthrow of
                        the present military regime.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Where do we go in Ethiopia?</hi> It was agreed that we
                        should not pull out of Ethiopia entirely, because we wish to be in a
                        position to reassert ourselves there if a friendlier and more humane
                        government comes to power. But it was also agreed that we cannot justify
                        further significant support to the present government in view of its moves
                        toward the Soviets, its ineffectiveness in governing its own country and its
                        brutalization of its people. Non-lethal military aid that is in the current
                        pipeline—5T and 2½T trucks and jeeps—will be delivered and military training
                        of Ethiopians in the United States will be continued. All other military
                        aid—ammunition, APCs, F–5 aircraft—even when it has been on order and paid
                        for by the Ethiopians—will be subject to delaying action. We will not tell
                        the Ethiopians we are delaying; we will simply wait and see. Meanwhile,
                        economic aid will continue. This situation will naturally need to be
                        reassessed every few weeks in the light of new developments in
                            Ethiopia.<note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3">In an April 11 memorandum to

                            after he returned to Mogadiscio. He reported on his meeting in telegram
                            826 from Mogadiscio, May 23. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign
                            Policy File, D770183–0097)</note> We will also send an exploratory aid
                        mission to Somalia to see what we might be able to do economically. For the
                        time being we will let the Saudis take the lead in offering money for
                        military aid. No conclusion was reached on the possibility of sending a U.S.
                        vessel on a port call. The discussion highlighted some of the problems in
                        rushing into too close a relationship with the Somalis too soon, including
                        the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> may be
                        trying to play both us and the Soviets at the same time. More specific are
                        the danger of frightening Kenya and of encouraging Somali territorial
                        ambitions toward Ethiopia and Djibouti.</p>

                        was pointed out that Kenya feels endangered these days not only by Somalia
                        and the growing Soviet orientation of Ethiopia, but by Soviet aid to
                        Tanzania and Uganda.</p>

                        The consensus was that this leaves the situation more open and is less
                        likely to drive Ethiopia into the hands of the Soviets. My own view, for
                        whatever it is worth, is that that approach is still correct but I will wait
                        to hear from you before raising the issue with the President.</p>

                    <p>We had an earlier hint from the Minister of Defense that the Ethiopian

                        shut off the remaining non-lethal items in the pipeline and, when we have
                        safely withdrawn our people and decreased the size of our staff, inform the

                        for departure (“time will be no problem”), but did not say how much time.
                        With regard to both Addis and Asmara, the Charge raised the issues of

                        that he will relay the Charge’s request for a meeting with the Minister of

                    <p>100279. Subject: Somali Ambassador’s Call on Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. In half-hour conversation with Secretary May 3, Somali Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> sought assurances that US
                        would be prepared in principle to provide Somalia with economic and military
                        aid. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> stressed that he was
                        acting under personal instructions from President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> delivered to him in private meetings
                        and of which only Security Chief General Suleiman might be aware. He
                        emphasized the importance of preventing any leak, noting specifically that
                            <gloss target="#t_MOFA_1">MOFA</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_DirGen_1">DirGen</gloss> Abdul Rahman Jama Barre would not
                        be privy to these instructions.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> said <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> was increasingly concerned at the
                        growing ties between Ethiopia and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                        >USSR</gloss>, particularly the latter’s supply of arms to Ethiopia.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> does not believe that
                        Somalia and Ethiopia can be in the same camp at the same time. However, he
                        noted, the depth of Somalia’s relationship with the Soviets makes it very
                        difficult for Somalia to make a change. The Soviets have been pushing hard
                        for Somalia to submerge its differences with Ethiopia in the interests of
                        their common espousal of socialism and had even urged that Somalia join with
                        Ethiopia, Aden and eventually Djibouti in a socialist federation. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> said that the Somalis see socialism
                        as a pragmatic way of developing economically and socially, but they are
                        also very strong <pb n="47" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_47"/>nationalists and
                        deeply religious and have no interest in international socialism. Their
                        talks with the Soviets have been very tough, including those with Podgorny,
                        and the discussions had deadlocked with the Somalis rejecting any compromise
                        of Somali national interests.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> said that in order to resist
                        Soviet pressures, Somalia had to look for alternatives. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> had asked him to seek from the
                        Secretary and the President a response to Somalia’s request for economic and
                        military assistance. The Somali need for assurances particularly on the
                        military side had gained urgency because of the Soviet deliveries of
                        military equipment to Ethiopia which raised the possibility that Ethiopian
                        leader <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>, now in Moscow
                        obviously to discuss military matters with the Soviets, might start
                        something which would jeopardize Somali security. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> noted that fifteen years ago Somalia
                        had sought military assistance from the United States and European
                        countries, and only when these efforts failed had they accepted a Russian
                        offer. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> noted that Somali
                        flexibility and the ability to withstand Soviet pressure depended on whether
                        the US response was negative or positive. He added that Somalia was not now
                        asking for a huge supply of arms from the US but did need to know if the US
                        was in principle prepared to supply arms and would be willing to send an
                        initial token shipment.</p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary said that on the economic side we are prepared to send a
                        group very promptly to Somalia to discuss possible projects, and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> could so report. The US is
                        also prepared to encourage others to provide economic aid. With respect to
                        arms, the Secretary noted that we have been trying to formulate our arms
                        transfer policy and hope to have that review completed in a couple of weeks.
                        He suggested that meanwhile Somalia should look at alternative sources. Once
                        we have decided on our overall policy, the US will be in a better position
                        to respond one way or the other.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> accepted Secretary’s offer
                        to send <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> team and expressed hope for
                        earliest possible positive response to military aid request.</p>

                            >May 5.</note> They had tried to find space on the President’s calendar
                        for <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> but preparations for the
                        trip to Europe, press conferences and other commitments have made it
                        impossible. The Secretary offered, however, to arrange an appointment for
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> with the Vice
                        President in the next couple of days.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">See <ref

                        the importance <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> attaches to his

                    <p>Somali Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> called on me
                        May 11, at his request. He also met last week with <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy Vance</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d17">Document 17</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> began by describing Soviet
                        pressures on Somalia to accept Ethiopia’s existing borders. According to
                            <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName>, the Soviets have as their
                        objective the creation of a cluster of states, including Ethiopia, Somalia,
                        Aden, and Djibouti, under Moscow’s influence. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"
                            >Addou</persName> stated that Somalia’s national interests dictate
                        otherwise: Somalia seeks the self-determination of Somali people throughout
                        the Horn. Because of this divergence, Somalia is turning to us for economic
                        and military assistance. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName>
                        cautioned that only he and President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> know of this initiative, which is being pursued at
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s request.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> expressed satisfaction that a
                        U.S. economic mission would be traveling to Somalia next week to study
                        specific projects. He is concerned, however, about the vagueness of State’s
                        reply concerning <pb n="49" facs="0084" xml:id="pg_49"/>military assistance.
                        Somalia recognizes our difficulty in supplying large-scale military aid
                        immediately and, since there is no internal military threat in his country,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> noted, the U.S. could
                        begin its military supply at a low level. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"
                            >Addou</persName> insisted, nevertheless, that we give Somalia a formal
                        reply within one month as to whether we will assist with military hardware.
                        Only the U.S. can help Somalia in dealing with the Soviet Union, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> added.</p>
                    <p>I encouraged them, as did <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy Vance</persName>,
                        to buy military equipment elsewhere and that we would be supportive of that
                        effort. He then indicated that they might be able to buy military equipment
                        funneled through North Yemen. I’m not sure what he meant by that. He
                        indicated a desire for armored personnel carriers and mortars as desired
                        items. He indicated receptivity to arms being purchased for Somalia in
                        Europe, but he repeatedly emphasized the need for the symbolism of U.S.
                        military support, even though on a limited basis.</p>
                    <p>In reply to my question, <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> said
                        that military assistance from the U.S. definitely would lead Somalia to
                        reduce the Soviet presence. Somalia would end its military arrangements with
                        the Soviet Union. Somalia only had turned to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> in the first place, he said, following U.S. and Western
                        European refusal to help. I asked what the Somalis would be prepared to do
                        regarding Berbera, and <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName>
                        replied, without specifying a time, that the Soviet use of these
                        installations also might be reconsidered.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3"
                            >Documentation on U.S. concern about Soviet use of the port at Berbera
                            is in <ref target="frus1977-80v18">

                        the Soviets simply have access to the port and airfield at Berbera and that
                        the communications center there is jointly operated by the Soviets and the
                        Somalis. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> observed that the
                        Soviets had infiltrated the entire Somali establishment, including the
                        military, and this all was a very touchy matter. I told <persName
                            corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> that, unlike the Soviets, we have no
                        designs on Somalia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> observed that the Soviets have
                        targeted Ethiopia as a model for communist revolution. Moscow, he noted,
                        never was as certain with Somalia because of Somalia’s strong religious,
                        regional and nationalist commitments.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> that I would discuss our
                        meeting with you. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> also hopes
                        to meet with you personally.</p>

                    <p>In reference to your request for comments on the Vice President’s memo

                                target="#d18">Document 18</ref>.</note> let me say that a good way
                        to initiate a relationship with the Somalis on military matters would be for
                        them to agree to let us have a defense attache in our embassy in Mogadiscio
                        again. We have had none since 1970. A good attache could be a source of
                        judgment about some of the fine points of military matters that we lack
                        now—and his presence would be symbolically important and a good test of
                        Somali intentions.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that, taking explicit note of Ambassador <persName

                        permit the immediate dispatch of a U.S. military attache.<note n="3"

                    <p>The meeting opened with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"
                            >Addou</persName> making a rather extensive statement to the President.
                        He said he appreciated the great honor of being received by the President
                        and wished to convey greetings from President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> and his admiration for the President’s stand on human
                        rights. “There is no political oppression in Somalia,” he declared, “and
                        Somalia’s people are deeply democratic by nature.” He went on to comment
                        that the situation in the region was becoming more complicated: “For social
                        and economic development we need peace and must be able to defend
                        ourselves.” He said that his government was grateful for the U.S. economic
                        mission that had just visited Mogadiscio.<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">The
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> survey mission visited
                            Mogadiscio May 24–June 2. Telegram 894 from Mogadiscio, June 2,
                            transmitted a summary of the mission’s activities. (National Archives,
                            RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D770196–0816)</note> “We also want
                        to be able to count on the U.S. for our defense. The <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is putting enormous pressure on the
                        Somali government to accept its idea of Soviet hegemony in the area.
                        International socialism is supposed to come first and national interests
                        second. Somalia’s national interests must come first and other forms of
                        cooperation come afterward.” The Ambassador added that Somalis value their
                        independence too highly to be willing to consider joining together with
                        Ethiopia or other countries in the area. He described a “problem of human
                        rights” with Ethiopia—two million Somalis in Ethiopia, he said, want to be
                        free of Ethiopian rule. To protect its interests, Somalia needs both
                        economic and military assistance, he said, and President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> will be waiting for an answer. In
                        conclusion he summed up his position: “We must either resist Soviet pressure
                        or succumb. We hope not to <pb n="52" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_52"/>have to
                        succumb, which would be contrary to our national heritage. We appreciate the
                        deep interest you have shown in the Somali people since you came to office.
                        For years we have sought improved relations with the United States, but we
                        were not listened to.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> asked the Ambassador
                        to convey to President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> his
                        strong personal good wishes and thanks for his interest, which parallels
                        ours, in having an increasingly strong friendship with Somalia. The
                        President also asked that his congratulations be conveyed to the
                        Ambassador’s daughter and President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName>’s son who will be married shortly. The President then
                        went on to comment that the United States has been concerned about the
                        closeness between Somalia and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        which had been a reason for doubt on our part that our friendship could be
                        strong but, he said, “I believe that is now changing—we have watched with
                        care the development of Berbera and the calls of Soviet ships there; we also
                        have the impression that Soviet anti-submarine airplanes have been flying
                        from Somalia. Because of the independent nature of the Somali people, we
                        feel you are well able to take care of your own interests. We are eager to
                        understand your needs more clearly. But it is hard for us to understand the
                        military needs. A military attache would be helpful in giving us more
                        understanding of your military needs. We do not want to compete with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> because we want Somalia to be
                        non-aligned and not dominated by anyone. We can move more easily on a
                        unilateral basis to give economic aid than military aid. We are trying to
                        work with the Saudis<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">In telegram 8402 from Cairo,

                        has adequate defense capabilities without relying on the Soviet Union. We
                        want the Somalis to recognize their own destiny. We hope your problems with
                        Ethiopia can be peacefully worked out, and we are pleased that the <gloss

                        by everyone in the area. I hope your own people will see an advantage in
                        seeking progress with multinational friends, not by relying just on us but
                        by relying on European countries, too. We are cooperating carefully with
                        them and with the Saudis. In meetings with some of our European friends we
                        have discussed Somalia and how important it is to have it associated with us
                        as a democratic country. We appreciate your own personal friendship with our
                        country and we recognize you as a spokesman for democratic processes and
                        freedom. There is no doubt that you represent your nation well and <pb
                            n="53" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_53"/>report our views well to your
                        government and that means a great deal to us.”</p>
                    <p>The President continued:</p>
                    <p>“We recognize the strategic importance of your country because of the
                        character and attitude of your people and your insistence on independence of
                        action and thought. You can have a very important influence in your whole
                        region. The degree with which we can communicate freely is important, of
                        course, and we do appreciate the steady but very gratifying trend toward the
                        removal of past doubts and misunderstandings and difficulties. The trends
                        are all in the right direction. We are very hopeful—and the members of the
                        Congress share my hope—that they will culminate in a completely comfortable
                        relationship between our country and yours.”</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador commented briefly on the fact that Somalis are 100% religious
                        people and took his prayer beads out of his pocket to emphasize that he
                        himself prayed five times each day. He went on to say that the Soviets came
                        to Somalia because the Somalis had had no choice—“but now we see in you, Mr.
                        President, hope and inspiration. We hope your human rights drive encourages
                        other people.” The President at this point rose to say that he would like to
                        step out for a moment to get a small gift he would like the Ambassador to
                        take back to President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>.
                        Meanwhile, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked the
                        Ambassador whether President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>
                        had made any public declarations about human rights. The Ambassador noted
                        that <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> had condemned the killings
                        that were taking place in Ethiopia and had taken <persName
                            corresp="#p_AIDO_1">Idi Amin</persName> to task for his cruelty. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked whether
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> had said anything publicly
                        about President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s human
                        rights position. The Ambassador indicated that he had not but that he
                        expected he would. The President returned with a volume of U.S. satellite
                        photography which was examined briefly by the Ambassador and the President
                        and then good-byes and good wishes were exchanged.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he would return from Somalia at the end of August and he
                        hoped there would be good developments by then. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> accompanied the Ambassador to
                        his car.</p>

                        not occur. I find we have these from the Foreign Secretary. I believe that a

                        this approach to the Congress. Recently we reported an Israeli violation in

                        problem minimally acceptable to both is not achieved.</p>
                    <p>Moscow also probably calculates that the survival of the <persName

                        jeopardized by its failure to hang onto Eritrea in some way.</p>
                    <p>Prospects for Soviet success in arranging such an agreement are dim. Efforts
                        to negotiate a compromise last spring by both former President Podgorny and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> were reportedly rejected
                        by the Somalis and Eritreans. These Soviet attempts to mediate foundered on
                        Somali unwillingness to accept anything less than annexation of the Ogaden
                        and on Eritrean demands for total independence. Recent Somali and Eritrean
                        military successes against the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> regime’s hard pressed forces have probably only
                        strengthened Eritrean and Somali determination to reject a compromise.</p>

                        for these items. The Somalis say that after this initial delivery, the US
                        could send a military attache, preferably a General, to discuss Somalia’s
                        more sophisticated requirements. <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"

                        (small arms and ammunition to equip, respectively, 80,000 and 100,000 men),
                        the request to us is relatively modest. It is nonetheless a canard to
                        describe the items listed, as did <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"
                            >Addou</persName>, as the “minimum needed to fill existing gaps in
                        Somalia’s defensive structure:” for instance, the 70,785 semi-automatic
                        rifles requested would give each one of Somalia’s 30,000 soldiers two such
                        rifles apiece, with 10,785 to spare.</p>
                    <p>The Somalis have recently received $8 million of small arms and ammunition
                        from the Saudis and $13 million from the Egyptians. In addition, the French
                        have agreed to provide 10% of the request which they have from Somalia, if
                        financing can be arranged. The British have not yet responded. The Iranians
                        are planning to send a military survey mission to Mogadiscio next week and
                        have asked us if we would be willing to permit them to transfer US-supplied
                        arms to Somalia.</p>

                    <p>The Somali effort to accumulate new arms not subject to Soviet control,
                        coupled with increased activity by Somali “irregulars” in the Ogaden, along

                    <p>Quote. On 23 July 1977 at 0300 hours <gloss target="#t_GMT_1">GMT</gloss>
                        Somalia’s armed forces, supported by tanks and aircraft, have crossed the
                        common boundary into Ethiopian territory and have started full scale war of
                        aggression against Ethiopia. These forces are now carrying out military
                        operations at Deghabur, Kebredehar, Warder and Gode inside Ethiopia. The
                        situation which is a serious threat to international peace and security, is
                        a culmination of Somalia’s expansionist policy which has as its goal the
                        annexation of Ethiopian territory.</p>
                    <p>Quote. Over the last several months the Government of the Democratic Republic
                        of Somalia has been infiltrating its regular troops into Ethiopia for the
                        deliberate purpose of committing aggression against Ethiopia short of
                        launching a full scale conventional war. These troops which are heavily
                        armed with sophisticated weapons such as missiles, anti-tank and
                        anti-aircraft weapons have thus far carried out systematic and extensive
                        terror and sabotage in eastern and southern Ethiopia. Furthermore, these
                        heavily armed Somali troops had attacked Ethiopian outposts in the vicinity
                        of Dogob, Togochale, Elgersele, Alaibede, Eneguhan, Debeguriale, Ferfer,
                        Elkoren and Dudub. Although such attacks by the Somali armed forces
                        constitute flagrant violations of Ethiopia’s territorial integrity, the
                        Government of Ethiopia, exercising utmost self-restraint and having no
                        desire to escalate the situation into direct military confrontation between
                        the armed forces of the two countries, has taken every precaution to limit
                        the defence of its territory within the confines of its international
                        boundary and had been successful in repelling the infiltrating Somali
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>Quote. As the aggressive actions it has taken so far by infiltrating troops
                        have thus failed to achieve its expansionist objectives, the Government of
                        Somalia has now resorted to direct armed aggression using its combined
                        ground and air forces.</p>
                    <p>Quote. In view of the above, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the PMG of
                        socialist Ethiopia requests Their Excellencies the chiefs of diplomatic
                        missions to inform urgently their respective government of these grave
                        developments. Unquote.</p>

                        all elements are there.” Finally Ethiopia did not plan to break relations
                        with Somalia “for now.”</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The Situation in the Ogaden</hi>. The Somalis now appear
                        to control about two-thirds of the Ogaden. Given existing Somali military
                        deployments, the three major garrison towns remaining in Ethiopian hands are
                        in no imminent danger, although Somali insurgent forces continue their
                        efforts to cut off communications among them. However, should regular troops
                        based in northern Somalia move in force across the border with the objective
                        of taking the towns, all three would probably fall after a period.</p>
                    <p>The loss of the three towns would not preclude an eventual Ethiopian
                        countermove, but it would delay it and make it more difficult. Politically,
                        it could provide an occasion for a political move by the Somalis, such as
                        the formal declaration of an “Ogaden Republic” by the insurgents or even an
                        annexation by Somalia. The fall of the towns probably would not in itself be
                        likely to cause the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>; it would weaken his authority, but his rivals
                        appear fully as committed to try to hold the Ogaden as is he.</p>

                        from their friendship with the Soviets during the very period when they were
                        putting the finishing touches on their plans for invading Ethiopia and
                        seizing nearly a third of its territory.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The Somali operation into Ethiopia is one of the most

                        built up internal insurgent movements (Galla<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2"
                            >Galla refers to the Oromo people of Ethiopia.</note> as well as
                        Somali-based) so that they could be credible as freedom fighters. Then they
                        added their own military forces—efficiently deployed and with clear military
                        objectives. They cloaked the whole operation in a barrage of propaganda and
                        diplomatic maneuvering, alleging Ethiopian atrocities against the Somali
                        population and the presence of large numbers of Cubans and other
                        mercenaries. The camouflage of their invasion has worn thin, but they stick
                        to their cover story and defy the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and
                        everyone else. Their propaganda would be admired by Goebbels. They would
                        have had a more difficult time if the Ethiopian forces in the Ogaden had not
                        already been <hi rend="italic">demoralized</hi> and they would have a
                        tougher time diplomatically if <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"

                    <p>But we should not lose sight of the fact that the Somalis invaded Ethiopia
                        with Soviet equipment and defeated the Ethiopians, who have been using
                        primarily U.S.-supplied equipment; in the process the Soma<pb n="62"
                            facs="0097" xml:id="pg_62"/>lis have probably already captured more U.S.
                        equipment and supplies than we could have delivered to them in a year if we
                        had undertaken to support them.</p>
                    <p>Even if the Somalis take Diredawa, Harar and Jijiga and even if they link up
                        with the Afars and Eritreans and cut off the last remaining Ethiopian
                        lifeline from the port of Assab, <hi rend="italic">they will be in a
                            precarious position.</hi> To maintain themselves in Ethiopia they must
                        have military support. They cannot now expect to get it from the West—so
                        they must rely on what the Soviets can supply. Even if the Soviets should
                        cut them off while the Iraqis and other remaining friends continue to
                        provide what they can, the Somalis may have to shift to a position of
                        gradual military withdrawal to the purely Somali-populated parts of Ethiopia
                        they can justify some claim to.</p>
                    <p>Ethiopia, though close to being militarily defeated both in the Southeast and
                        in Eritrea, can never reconcile itself to major Somali territorial gains. A
                        more humane and representative Ethiopian government—if this is what follows
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>—is likely to be able to
                        attract much more sympathy and support from the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                            >OAU</gloss> and from countries outside Africa. <hi rend="italic">It is
                            difficult to envision any circumstances where the Somalis can secure any
                            significant measure of endorsement for their territorial claims against
                            Ethiopia, let alone for the manner in which they have asserted
                            them.</hi> Thus the Ethiopia-Somalia quarrel is likely to fester for
                        years to come. A resurgent Ethiopia, much stronger in terms of population
                        and resources than Somalia can ever be, is bound to reassert itself against
                        Somalia when it has mustered the strength to do so. This will be especially
                        true if the Somalis succeed in capturing Diredawa and Harar, which have
                        great emotional and patriotic significance for Ethiopia. Ethiopians born in
                        Harar or derived from the Harari Amhara ruling group are still prominent in
                        the Ethiopian leadership and are likely to be even more influential in a
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> government than
                        they are now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">So where do we go with Somalia?</hi> We should aim to show
                        as much skill as they have in playing all sides against all sides. We want
                        to continue to maintain friendly relations and, thus, some basis for
                        dialogue and influence. We may want to continue to develop an economic aid
                        program for the same purpose.</p>
                    <p>Somalia, internally, remains <hi rend="italic">essentially a police state.
                            Political strains</hi> are likely to develop once the rejoicing over the
                        victories in Ethiopia subsides. The Somalis in the territories taken over
                        from Ethiopia may prove harder to digest than the leadership in Mogadiscio
                        anticipates. There is a great potential for tribal/clan strains. Somalia is
                        a very poor country; it is questionable whether it can offer a standard of
                        life equivalent to the low standard prevailing in the territories it has
                        seized. It will have a difficult time keeping up economic activity in Harar
                        and Diredawa if it seizes and holds this relatively rich area and Djibouti,

                        will have plenty of problems and will need help and advice. And there will
                        be many ways in which Somalia can be subjected to pressure.</p>

                        without encountering objections from the Soviets—if they follow a policy of
                        relative coolness to the Somalis. Iran and Saudi Arabia have a tradition of
                        being relatively pro-Ethiopian and are likely to revert to this position if
                        a rational government replaces <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>. Somalia has always been relatively isolated in
                        Africa. It cannot win <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> support for its
                        territorial claims. It can win no friends by threatening Kenya.</p>
                    <p>Somalia may, in the end, have no recourse but to return to the Soviet
                        embrace. It is far from clear yet that the Somalis have firmly committed
                        themselves to become extricated from dependence on the Soviets. We cannot
                        condone their recent behavior or support their ultimate
                        political/territorial aims. Neither should we push them back into the laps
                        of the Soviets. Instead, we should attempt to exploit the basic weaknesses
                        in their position to persuade and push them into a settlement in the Horn
                        that could ultimately benefit all the countries there. As an ultimate aim,
                        some sort of regional federation makes sense . . .</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The meeting reviewed the situation of each of the five Horn countries in
                        light of the tensions created by Somali and Eritrean insurgent advances in
                        Ethiopia and the increasing evidence of deterioration of <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s regime. It was decided:</p>
                    <p>• to accelerate our efforts to provide support to Sudan</p>
                    <p>• to take steps to reassure and strengthen Kenya</p>
                    <p>• to try to get as many African leaders as possible to participate in a call
                        to all outside powers to refrain from supplying arms to fuel the
                        Ethiopian-Somali confrontation so that there can be a cease-fire and an
                        effort at mediation.</p>
                    <p>It was concluded that since the U.S. does not want to supply arms to either
                        Ethiopia or Somalia now but the Soviets are supplying to both, an appeal for
                        an arms embargo would dramatize the destructive role the Soviets are playing
                        in the area.</p>
                    <p>It was also decided that we should keep up dialogue with the Somalis, even
                        though we do not want to supply arms, and that we should reciprocate the
                        Ethiopians’ desire to talk to us about their present predicament, though
                        there is no case for meeting their request that <pb n="65" facs="0100"
                            xml:id="pg_65"/>we send an Ambassador.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">After

                            the Embassy until <persName corresp="#p_CFL_1">Chapin</persName> arrived
                            at post on July 21, 1978.</note> To send an Ambassador to Ethiopia now
                        might lead the Somalis to conclude that we were tilting decisively against
                        them. We will go ahead too with two small aid projects in Ethiopia to show
                        our concern for its people and we will look for opportunities to provide
                        modest economic assistance to Djibouti. We will look into the possibility of
                        some medical aid for both Ethiopia and Somalia.</p>
                    <p>It was concluded that we want to enhance our longer-range chances for
                        increasing our influence in both Ethiopia and Somalia while doing what we
                        can to ensure that the Soviets gain as little as possible—or in fact,
                        lose—from their current involvement. Meanwhile we want to try to persuade
                        other Africans to feel a sense of responsibility for what is happening
                        between Ethiopia and Somalia.</p>

                    <p>Since we do not want to supply arms to either Ethiopia or Somalia now but the
                        Soviets are supplying them to both, an appeal for an arms embargo will
                        dramatize the destructive role the Soviets are playing in the area.</p>
                    <p>We also decided that we should keep up dialogue with the Somalis, even though
                        we do not want to supply arms, and that we should reciprocate the
                        Ethiopians’ desire to talk to us about their present predicament, though
                        there is no case for meeting their request that we send an Ambassador. We
                        will go ahead too with two small aid projects in Ethiopia to show our
                        concern for its people and we will look for opportunities to provide modest
                        economic assistance to Djibouti. We will look into the possibility of some
                        medical aid for both Ethiopia and Somalia.</p>
                    <p>It is my feeling that these decisions represent most of the sensible steps we
                        can take at the moment. We cannot intervene in the conflict between Ethiopia
                        and Somalia and we have to let the Eritrean situation take its course.<note

                        possible—or in fact, lose—from their involvement. We will probably have to
                        reassess the situation again in a few weeks if conditions in the Horn do not
                        stabilize, which seems very unlikely.</p>

                        plane and whispered into my ear an appeal for release of the eight F–5E’s
                        the U.S. had originally scheduled to supply to Ethiopia this year. “Our Air
                        Force will consider these more valuable than a hundred MIG’s and they will
                        not forget the United States if you supply them—I assure you,” he said;
                        “there are people in our Air Force who understand the political factors here
                        very well.” I did not have time to ask him what he was really trying to say,
                        but I interpret it as a possible hint that the Ethiopian Air Force might
                        take the lead in pushing <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        aside if they could be assured of subsequent American military support.
                        During the early phase of the revolution the Air Force was opposed to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and his fellow
                        extremists. We might have an option here that we could use in the future,

                        influence of publicity about the Sudan’s rosy long-term economic development
                        prospects, is largely unaware that the Sudanese government has used up all
                        its working cash and is suffering an acute balance-of-payments problem
                        which, if a solution is not found, could undermine the enormous development

                        the problems between Ethiopia and Somalia which pose dilemmas for the Sudan.
                        The Sudan cannot support the Somali incursion into the Ogaden, because it is
                        still concerned about its own territorial integrity and sympathizes with
                        Kenya. They do not trust <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>,
                        however, and find the Eritrean problem (which they feel <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> has exacerbated) awkward from
                        every point of view. In the final analysis, <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                            >Deng</persName> made clear, they would like to see the Eritrean
                        question settled by negotiation which would reestablish some form of
                        federation between Eritrea and Ethiopia. I told <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                            >Deng</persName> that I hoped they might be able to encourage a
                        negotiated settlement, drawing other Africans into the effort, even though
                        the process would be slow. He indicated little hope of an Eritrean
                        settlement while <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> remains in
                        power.</p>
                    <p>I had a good talk with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] in Khartoum who are in touch with both <hi
                            rend="italic">Eritreans and <gloss target="#t_EDU_1">EDU</gloss>
                        </hi> people [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].
                        They are inclined to feel that factionalism among Eritreans will worsen and
                        may even be exploited by the Ethiopians. They had heard that the <gloss
                            target="#t_EPLF_1">EPLF</gloss> was splitting (Marxists vs
                        traditionalists) which would make four Eritrean factions! <hi rend="italic"
                            >The <gloss target="#t_EDU_1">EDU</gloss>
                        </hi>, they said, while beset by disagreements among its top leadership, is
                        rather well organized at medium and lower levels and has people going in and
                        out of Ethiopia, deep into the interior, all the time. If <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> begins to falter, the <gloss
                            target="#t_EDU_1">EDU</gloss> will in all likelihood assert itself
                        rapidly. But for the moment, the <gloss target="#t_EDU_1">EDU</gloss> has a
                        problem: in view of the Somali attack, it does not want to appear to be
                        stabbing Ethiopia (as opposed to <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>) in the back. It is wavering, therefore, on its
                        plans for an early offensive.</p>
                    <p>I left the <hi rend="italic">Sudan</hi> with the impression that it is going
                        to remain an inward-looking country which wishes to concentrate on its own
                        economic development and be involved in foreign affairs only with the
                        purpose of defending its own territorial integrity and freedom of action.
                        The Sudan will pay lip service to Arab causes only to the extent this is
                        absolutely necessary to keep Arab money flowing in for economic development.
                        The Sudanese are still preoccupied with reintegrating their South and are
                        serious in trying to draw the Ansars back into the <pb n="69" facs="0104"
                            xml:id="pg_69"/>main stream of national development. This will not
                        necessarily be an easy task. They want and deserve both economic and
                        military support from us, but we must not overestimate the extent to which
                        they can play an active role in the politics of the area. They are likely to
                        remain strongly anti-Soviet.</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="italic">London</hi> we met with the Foreign Office official in
                        charge of Horn and Kenyan affairs, Peter Rosling, and found that our
                        perceptions of problems and prospects are very similar.<note n="4"

                        support and following inside the country and capable of playing a role in
                        northern Ethiopia and perhaps even in Addis if <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> falls or if there is further political
                        deterioration in the country.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I would like to note a few things about the Horn I have not
                        otherwise commented upon in my reports so far:</p>
                    <p>• The Chinese are unimportant as a factor in the area and have no capability
                        for competing with the Soviets. To the extent that they have influence, it
                        tends to be favorable to our (and to general western) interests.</p>
                    <p>• Djibouti, about which we were so concerned a few months ago, has been
                        eclipsed as a problem by the larger spectacle of Somali-Ethiopian clash and
                        the involvement of the Soviets with both protagonists.</p>
                    <p>• The Soviets could end up increasing their influence in the area, but they
                        are winning neither love nor respect. Their aims are seen everywhere as
                        self-serving and narrowly materialistic and contrasted unfavorably with our
                        own approach. The large African diplomatic/UN community in Ethiopia, almost
                        to a man, sees the Soviets as crass and opportunistic. Thus, in the longer
                        run, their adventures in the <pb n="70" facs="0105" xml:id="pg_70"/>Horn are
                        not likely to increase their prestige or attractiveness elsewhere in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>• With the flight of the ideologues from <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"

                        felt to be most likely to come from within the Dirg or from the Ethiopian

                    <p>• The Horn is an area where everything that happens involves interactions
                        between Africa and the Middle East. The more complex issues in the Horn
                        become, however, the more the moderate states in both Africa and the Middle
                        East are inclined to try to sit on the sidelines. This is not advantageous
                        to our interests, for if the problems of this area are to be settled, there
                        have to be compromises and careful negotiation encouraged by moderate
                        governments with their own interests in stability in the area.</p>
                    <p>I will prepare a brief summary of conclusions from my entire trip for passing
                        on to the President if you wish.</p>

                            greet President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> since we
                            were aware of the long struggle he had been involved in so intimately
                            which culminated in Djibouti’s independence.<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4"
                                >Djibouti gained its independence on July 27, 1977.</note> This must
                            be a source of pride and satisfaction to you. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said that the United
                            States would do all it could to help Djibouti. He expressed his pleasure
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> would be
                            visiting Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>
                            on whom the President relies heavily for a variety of matters, foreign
                            and domestic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>
                            expressed the hope that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> will be able to say hello during President
                                <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName>’s call on the Vice
                            President, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                            schedule is very full and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> wanted to emphasize the importance the US
                            attaches to the meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1"
                                >Gouled</persName> and Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1"
                                >Mondale</persName>. He expressed his concern over the fighting in
                            the Ogaden which was causing instability in the area and difficulties
                            for Djibouti at the outset of its independent life. He noted that the US
                            has tried to follow a neutral role by not supplying either party,
                            instead giving support to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> in
                            its efforts to reach a solution.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> expressed his
                            pleasure at being in Washington to greet the leaders and people of the
                            city and looked forward to his meeting with Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>, with whom he hoped to discuss
                            a number of problems. He said that it would be an added pleasure to meet
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> if only very
                            briefly. With reference to the long <pb n="72" facs="0107"
                                xml:id="pg_72"/>period of struggle for Djibouti’s independence. He
                            noted that it is certain that Djibouti will advocate peace in the region
                            and in the world. While the Republic of Djibouti is small and young, it
                            does not lack a certain importance potentially especially with regard to
                            the Bab-e-Mandeb<note n="5" xml:id="d30fn5">The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait
                                connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.</note> visit. Djibouti
                            hoped to contribute to equilibrium in the area through neutrality.</p>
                        <p>However, the Republic of Djibouti is like a new child unable to walk. It
                            needs the material means and support to progress. As for the conflict in
                            the area, Djibouti is certainly concerned, having some 10,000 refugees
                            from the conflict, with the railroad cut off for over three months, and
                            with the port not having been functioning all that time—all of this
                            gives Djibouti social and economic problems in great proportions. For
                            humanitarian reasons, Djibouti cannot refuse access to its territory for
                            the elderly and for children.</p>
                        <p>As for the Ogaden conflict, President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1"
                                >Gouled</persName> said that the conflict is serious as Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> is aware. It’s a
                            problem which must be solved by the great powers. Djibouti did not have
                            the means for solving it, being able to [have] only a moral influence
                            towards equilibrium. On moral grounds, nobody likes war, but certain
                            great powers are fueling the fires by supplying defensive and offensive
                            arms. That he described as the popular opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> reiterated the US
                            position of neutrality and restraint from supplying arms. He also
                            underscored US support for the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> in
                            its mediation efforts. He expressed understanding that the most Djibouti
                            could do is provide an example of peace. He asked where the refugees
                            were coming from.</p>
                        <p>Turning first to the question of neutrality towards the conflict,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> said that the
                            arms involved come from the big powers. There is of course no neutrality
                            among Djibouti’s neighbors, and all of Africa has been corrupted by
                            supplies of arms. There is therefore no reason to seek mediation from
                            Africans. He noted that many of the weapons used in Africa come from the
                            West. He asserted that there [are] too many arms in Africa. Therefore
                            there is a need for a high level decision to cut the flow of arms to
                            Africa. He expressed his awareness that the United States is not
                            supplying arms in the conflict in the Ogaden, but rather the Soviets are
                            to both sides. He expressed a conviction that big power intervention to
                            end the conflict was more likely to succeed than efforts by the <gloss

                        <p>As to the refugees, most came by rail from the area between Djibouti and
                            Dire Dawa. When he left Djibouti he understood the number to be 6,500.
                            The day before yesterday he telephoned to Djibouti and <pb n="73"

                            Somali side, President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName>
                            said that Djibouti would not have accepted them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said the mention
                            of the refugees called to mind Djibouti’s need for economic aid. He
                            noted US awareness of Djibouti’s historic ties to France. He said that
                            the US understands that a number of Arab states are interested in
                            helping. He said that the US also wants to be of assistance. He said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> people in Washington are
                            considering the matter and the Food for Peace people have recently
                            visited Djibouti. Concerning refugees, the US will work through the

                            burden the refugees place on Djibouti.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> expressed his
                            thanks and added that the Djibouti delegation had several formulations
                            to present on refugees, on the country’s agricultural potential and
                            sub-soil potential, rather than being just a service-oriented country as
                            in the past. President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName>
                            observed that the fact that Djibouti has French and Arab friends and has
                            chosen neutrality and has signed agreements with France leaves no doubt
                            as to Djibouti’s orientation. He thanked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> for US willingness to
                            share in the friendship that Djibouti offers to all.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister, Kamil, who is also Minister of Cooperation,
                            produced some papers on the problem of refugees and development needs of
                            Djibouti and said that Djibouti’s needs were urgent. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> noted that it would be
                            most appropriate to discuss these matters in detail with Mr. Gilligan.
                            Minister Kamil noted that their presentation did not go into any detail
                            as to what mechanism should be used to meet their needs, that is <gloss

                        <p>I share your deep concern about the present large-scale supply of foreign
                            arms to Ethiopia, and the implication for your country. In this respect,

                            you cooperate with their initiative. We will, when appropriate, give

                            defensive weapons to Somalia when the conflict in Ogaden has been
                            resolved.</p>

                    <p>Ethiopia’s overall military situation has deteriorated. In Eritrea, we have
                        clandestine reports that the Ethiopian government’s position has worsened,
                        and that Asmara is wracked by severe supply problems that gravely affect the
                        daily life of the civilian population. We also have reports of indiscipline
                        in the Ethiopian military forces there. In the Ogaden, we cannot confirm
                        Somali claims that Harar has fallen, but it appears that the city is
                        besieged on three sides by mixed Somali <pb n="80" facs="0115"
                            xml:id="pg_80"/>insurgent and regular forces. We think the Somalis have
                        an even chance of taking the town. If they do, the nearby town of Diredawa
                        will probably fall to the Somalis and its fall would delay Ethiopian plans
                        for an early December counterattack against Somali forces in the eastern
                        Ogaden and northern Somalia.</p>

                        overflight/transit routes (Tab B), and a summary of regional attitudes

                    <p>My comments are:</p>
                    <p>(1) Tab A does not analyze consequences. If any of the more militant ideas
                        have threshold merit—which I doubt—a lot more analysis will be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>(2) The idea that we should directly confront the Soviets/Cubans over
                        Ethiopia is misbegotten: (1) The Horn is a poor part of the world in which
                        to operate; (2) Direct confrontation ignores the logical preliminary step of
                        establishing a military supply relationship with Somalia in an effort to
                        keep the confrontation on a proxy basis; (3) It is difficult to perceive a
                        degree of US interest in the area sufficient to gain support of the US
                        public for direct action; (4) Quite possibly, Ethiopia will turn out to be a
                        quagmire for the Soviets; in short, it may be in our interest to let them
                        wallow.</p>

                        <p>This memo addresses hypothetical courses of action to further our
                            policies on the Horn, including the full range of military options to
                            serve our objectives. It only <hi rend="italic">lists
                                possibilities;</hi> it does not purport to discuss feasibility,
                            risks, or advisability.</p>
                        <p>We assume US policy continues to be to promote an end to fighting and a
                            peaceful resolution of the dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia, i.e.,
                            to remain neutral in the dispute and not support either Ethiopia or
                            Somalia. (We would need to assess the continued validity and viability
                            of maintaining this neutrality at the same time we greatly activized our
                            resistance to Soviet efforts.) At the same time we seek to end Soviet
                            and Cuban military support—arms and personnel—to Ethiopia. Moreover, we
                            assume that direct use of Soviet or Cuba personnel in a combat role is
                            something we especially want to prevent.</p>
                        <p>We further assume we would continue (and expand) our diplomatic efforts
                            with other African states rallying their active support to resolve the
                            conflict and oppose Soviet counter intervention either individually or
                            collectively as part of the Organization of African Unity. However, the
                            receptivity of key nations to those appeals has been limited so far, and
                            their ability directly to stop either the fighting or Soviet
                            intervention is limited. It is therefore further assumed that these
                            “African” initiatives fail.</p>

                            particularly if Cuban or Soviet combat forces were introduced. The US
                            could go so far as to threaten to terminate ongoing arms control
                            negotiations (<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, Indian Ocean,
                                <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>); to restrict further
                            Soviet-American trade, etc. We could also threaten to abandon our
                            neutrality and support Somalia militarily unless the Soviets stop their
                            aid to Ethiopia.</p>

                        <p>In each case, we could stress that direct Soviet or Cuban combat

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">With the “overflight states</hi>,” the US could go
                            beyond our previous relatively low-key, factual presentations and seek
                            to put strong pressure on the countries over which the Soviets must fly
                            to refuse overflight rights, notably Yugoslavia and Turkey. In that
                            context, we would want to seek Arab support for similar pressures on
                            Syria and Iraq. To block the cross-Africa route, we would need to be
                            prepared to use similar pressure methods on African states, notably
                            Zaire, Kenya (most likely to resist), and Tanzania. Our pressure
                            resources obviously vary greatly from case-to-case. The Egyptians,
                            Saudis and Iranians would presumably back us up. Turkey is a difficult
                            case, given their dependence on Bulgaria for overflight rights, since
                            their dispute with Greece.</p>

                        <p>Generally, the US could move naval forces into the Red Sea and Indian
                            Ocean to demonstrate the seriousness of US interest in the resolution of
                            the conflict and the end of Soviet and Cuban support—and to provide
                            forces in the area for later actions. Moving air or ground forces would
                            require land bases not immediately available, except perhaps for the
                            3000 man Marine Amphibious Unit embarked with the Sixth Fleet.</p>
                        <p>—We could also or alternatively expand the scope of the problem for the
                            Soviets and Cubans, e.g., by actively backing <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"

                    <p>The meeting was devoted entirely to discussion of the current situation in
                        the Horn of Africa and its implications for U.S. policy. During the first 25
                        minutes <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representatives summarized
                        currently available intelligence on the Soviet Airlift, the military
                        situation in Ethiopia, Ethiopian and Somali military capabilities and the
                        Ethiopian political situation. At the end of this presentation, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> directed the
                        intelligence community to give high priority to collection of information on
                        all these subjects and to analysis deriving from it—in particular Somali
                        capabilities and foreign support.</p>
                    <p>The next 40 minutes were devoted to discussion of the implications of Horn
                        developments for U.S. policy, their potential impact on larger issues in
                        U.S.-Soviet relations, and possible courses of action the United States
                        could consider to keep the situation from deteriorating further and cause
                        developments to move in directions more favorable to our basic interests. In
                        anticipation of a more focused meeting on these subjects in January with,
                        hopefully, more information available, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> suggested that several subjects be further
                        studied, with discussions meanwhile at Working Group level if necessary:</p>
                    <p>• the stability of the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        government and the character of alternate leadership groups.</p>
                    <pb n="85" facs="0120" xml:id="pg_85"/>
                    <p>• the current and projected military balance between the Ethiopians and the
                        Somalis.</p>
                    <p>• the role of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> and ways of influencing
                        it.</p>
                    <p>• possibilities for promoting serious negotiations between the Ethiopians and
                        the Somalis.</p>
                    <p>• new diplomatic initiatives in Africa and Europe.</p>
                    <p>• means of denying the Soviets an opportunity to consolidate their position
                        in Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>• possibilities for direct, frank talks with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>During the final ten minutes of the meeting, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss> paper on “Proposed Covert Action Regarding Ethiopia”<note

                        aid relationship with Ethiopia but will have to proceed carefully, since
                        there will be opposition in the Congress to providing assistance to the
                        Ethiopians. As soon as the Congress reconvenes, we will begin

                        little could be done now. Somalia is the aggressor and the French are
                        refraining from sending arms. We should continue to press the Ethiopians and
                        the Soviets not to move into Somalia and we should speak to the Somalians to
                        persuade them to negotiate. Perhaps they could agree to something like
                        self-determination or just consultation with the population of Ogaden. De
                        Guiringaud did not think the Nigerian effort would amount to anything.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> thought it would be useful for the

                        </hi> said that was only one half of the problem, i.e. how to get some
                        negotiations started; the other half of the problem is what happens if the
                        Cubans and Soviets remain in Ethiopia and use it as a base of operations.
                        Perhaps it would be better to show the Soviets that their continued presence
                        there would be costly by making some effort to get other States in the
                        Middle East and Africa to aid Somalia.</p>

                        help with the second problem but we certainly have to keep in our minds that
                        our objectives are to dislodge Soviet and Cuban influence from the area.</p>

                        </hi> then gave a rather general and philosophical statement of his concern
                        about Africa similar to the one he had made in <pb n="88" facs="0123"
                            xml:id="pg_88"/>London.<note n="5" xml:id="d39fn5">See <ref
                                target="#d34fn2">footnote 2, Document 34</ref>.</note> He said we
                        need to have a general view of the African situation. He believes it to be a
                        zone of danger. He said that we must convince the Soviets that some things
                        which they would like to pursue with us, such as defense and disarmament
                        matters, could be menaced if the situation to the south becomes difficult.
                        By and large, these countries in Africa are unstable and conflict there
                        could lead to difficulties in the whole world. Basically, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> does not believe that
                        the Soviets really desire to intervene in Africa but they tend to be called
                        in by the more radical States and then they cannot resist the temptation to
                        take advantage of a favorable situation. We must convince the Soviets that
                        this kind of irresponsible behavior on their part is not compatible with
                        detente.</p>
                    <p>He continued that there is also a problem of the psychology of African
                        leaders. They now see a situation where they can get arms easily from the
                        Soviets but all they get from us are rather vague statements of problems but
                        no immediate response. Therefore, these African leaders, even the moderate
                        ones, begin to feel that they have no support from the West in the face of
                        very real dangers, particularly with the activity of as many as 25,000
                        Cubans in various places. It was for this reason that <persName
                            corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> decided to intervene in Zaire—to
                        show moderate African leadership that they could resist these Soviet
                        inspired efforts. He also said that Algeria gets what it wants but
                        Mauritania has difficulty in getting support from us. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> said that he understands why it is
                        difficult for us to countenance intervention—it is also difficult for the
                        French—but we must find a way to restrain the Soviets and to give aid, not
                        just military aid, but economic and political support. Otherwise, we will
                        not be able to change the mental attitude.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Horn, <hi rend="italic">President <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>
                        </hi> said that Somalia is a very unstable place—a few years ago they told
                        us they were not getting aid from the Soviets and that there was no base at
                        Berbera. Now they admit it. Ethiopia is a perfectly horrible place—if one
                        talks about human rights they don’t exist there. If the conflict goes on for
                        a long time, eventually Ethiopia will win because they have 40 million
                        people but Somalia is basically on our side. But if we support Somalia we
                        are probably supporting an aggressor and a loser. If we do nothing there
                        will probably be a bad result as well so we need some initiative to try and
                        get peace and some fair solution to the Ogaden problem. We must avoid a
                        crushing defeat for Somalia. We need a diplomatic move. The Saudis are
                        giving some limited support but we have refrained while hinting to the
                        Soviets that we may have to act in time.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> asked whether France had discussed this
                        with the Soviets because he felt French interests, particularly in Djibouti,
                        were important. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        mentioned in this connection that he had heard from Sadat that <persName

                        </hi> replied that he felt there was mainly weakness in the African
                        States—in Morocco, in Algeria and in Egypt and, therefore, he couldn’t
                        really see that Egypt would be a very powerful force there. He thought it
                        more profitable to examine what the next steps should be diplomatically, not
                        militarily. He thought it hopeful that <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> had indicated he wished to have better relations with

                        they would have to act and we know from our intelligence that the Saudis are

                        on the problems in the Horn of Africa but eventually the French would want

                        problem. He thought if that was their objective the United States would have
                        to use its leverage because of all the things the Soviets want from us; but
                        perhaps this was not a good idea.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that it would still be useful for

                        Shah Discusses Horn of Africa in Aswan and Riyadh.</p>
                    <p>1. Upon his return from visits to Aswan and Riyadh, Shah told me he had
                        discussed Horn of Africa in both places. He said he found both Egyptians and
                        Saudis gravely concerned by Soviet activity there, and considered Saudis
                        “petrified” by prospect of Soviet presence across Red Sea.</p>
                    <p>2. Sadat told him that Numeiry had undertaken to send Sudanese brigade to
                        Berbera. Troops would be picked up by Egyptian ships and entire expedition
                        would be funded by Saudis. Sadat also said that Egypt would send crews to
                        Somalia to man <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> II missile sites, which
                        Somalis were unable to handle.</p>
                    <p>3. Shah got impression that Sadat is very preoccupied with idea that Soviets
                        are seeking to retaliate against him by seizing control of territory of
                        vital interest to Egypt. He mused on thought that Sadat might have been
                        impelled to his dramatic overtures in the Middle East and his generous
                        offers to Israel because he wishes to tidy up his eastern front in order to
                        concentrate on more pernicious dangers elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>I spent an hour with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AM_3">Ayalew</persName>
                        this morning. He had sought the meeting, he said, because he feared that
                        events in the Horn could take a fatally wrong turn <hi rend="italic">by
                            default</hi>. He wanted to think out loud with me to see if we could
                        find a way of preventing this. I found him serious, highly articulate and
                        seemingly entirely sincere.</p>
                    <p>He expounded Ethiopia’s view of the current conflict, stressing territorial
                        integrity, and argued that the U.S. position seemed equivocal to <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and negative to pro-Russian
                        extremists in the Derg. As long as U.S. condemnation of Somalia’s aggression
                        was done “whisperingly” (his word), he said <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> could not take any risks against these extremists
                        who wanted Ethiopia to sell itself totally to the Soviets. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> he characterized as an intense
                        and dedicated nationalist who sooner or later was bound to clash with the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>I took time to stress that our position was not and never had been
                        anti-Ethiopian and then read your message to <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> to him while he took notes on it.<note n="2"

                        was to know whether there was any real possibility of talking intelligently
                        with <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>. Did he realize the
                        danger of tieing Ethiopia so closely to the Russians that the United States
                        would have no choice—because of pressures from important friends in the area
                        such as Iran and Saudi Arabia—but to back the Somalis against Ethiopia?
                        Could we discuss this dilemma honestly with <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>? Was he prepared to accept the truth: that we had
                        given the Somalis neither encouragement nor any support of any kind and that
                        we did want good relations with Ethiopia and always have?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_AM_3">Ayalew</persName> was clearly moved by your
                        message and said he had something else very important to discuss with me
                        which he had told no one: he had just been recalled to Addis Ababa for
                        consultation and was debating whether to delay or not go at all. He said he
                        feared <pb n="93" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_93"/>something was afoot in Addis
                        because the ambassadors to the UN and to France had also been recalled. He
                        made clear he feared for his life and recounted an attempt on his life that
                        was made just before he departed for Washington. His car was machine-gunned
                        as he drove up to the Foreign Ministry. This was done by pro-Russian
                        elements who had pressured <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        to remove him as Minister of Defense but who resented his being sent to the
                        U.S. as Ambassador. He asked whether he could have a written text of your
                        letter to take back with him if he went. I said I would get him an answer as
                        soon as possible; he said he could leave early next week.</p>

                        relations with Ethiopia. He looks upon our initiative as protection—he can
                        risk returning to Addis. He is obviously a courageous man and says he has a

                        we should rely on the Ethiopians themselves to publicize it. If there is a

                        United States has never wavered from its long-standing position of support
                        for the territorial integrity of all African countries and condemnation of
                        use of force as a means of settling differences between nations. This has
                        always been and continues to be the basis of our policy toward Ethiopia. We
                        neither encouraged nor approved of the Somalis’ incursion into the Ogaden,
                        and we have told the Somalis that they can expect no military support from
                        the United States as long as they are in Ethiopian territory.<note n="3"

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName> has asked that a series
                        of ideas for covert action in respect to Ethiopia be passed to you for
                        initiative. These ideas would support certain overt initiatives which we are
                        now developing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Within</hi> Ethiopia we would like to build and exacerbate
                        tension between the Soviets and Cubans and the Ethiopians. We would like to
                        enhance <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s doubts about the
                        totality of the Soviets’ commitment to him and to feed suspicions, which he
                        reportedly already has, that they are grooming men more amenable to doing
                        their bidding with whom they could replace him. There may be other members
                        of the <gloss target="#t_PMGE_1">PMGE</gloss> and the Derg whose suspicions
                        of the Soviets and Cubans might also be enhanced.</p>
                    <p>On a broader scale, we would like to exacerbate tensions between
                        Russians/Cubans and Ethiopians at all levels of government and society.
                        Russians always have difficulty relating to foreign cultures. Ethiopians are
                        perhaps the proudest and most culture-conscious of all Africans. Strains
                        with Russians seem inevitable. As their numbers increase and their direct
                        intervention in military operations becomes more frequent, Soviets and
                        Cubans would seem especially likely to develop strained relations with
                        enlisted men and officers in the Ethiopian armed forces.</p>
                    <p>We are primarily interested in impact in Ethiopia as far as the kinds of
                        action mentioned above are concerned, but the actions themselves could be
                        initiated abroad as well as within the country.</p>
                    <p>As another facet of this effort, we would like to see greater covert
                        exploitation abroad of the problems the Soviet/Cuban involvement is causing
                        in Ethiopia and more negative analysis of the Soviet actions. Suggested
                        themes include:</p>
                    <p>• The Soviets are recreating Mussolini’s African Empire, in the wake of
                        already having taken over the Portuguese Empire; in other words, the Soviets
                        are the only colonial power left in Africa.</p>
                    <pb n="96" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_96"/>
                    <p>• Disdain for African sensitivities is shown by the Soviets’ crassly setting
                        the Somalis against the Ethiopians and their encouragement of the genocidal
                        policies of the Derg in Eritrea.</p>
                    <p>• The Soviets are encouraging <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> and extremists who are even more radical than he is
                        to brutalize their own people and fan tribal and regional hatreds which will
                        cause problems for years to come.</p>
                    <p>• The cost of Soviet intervention to the Ethiopians is high—and includes not
                        only the bill for the arms which they are expected to pay for, but economic
                        disruption and the destruction of normal life.</p>
                    <p>• The Soviets are pouring in weapons but show much less interest in providing
                        economic aid. Instead, the effort to pay for the weapons will bankrupt
                        Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>It may be that some aspects of this effort could be accommodated under
                        existing Presidential Findings. If the effort as a whole requires a new
                        Presidential Finding, it should be prepared as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>Since an <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting on the Horn of Africa
                        is scheduled for 25 January,<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">The meeting actually

                        centers on circular discussion of negotiations (how diplomats love to

                        preconditions for negotiation. There was also no discussion about Eritrea
                        (again I raised it but get no credit in this cable) and its important
                        relationship to the Ogaden conflict and the problem of Soviet and Cuban

                        <p>18370. Subject: Five Power Meeting on the Horn of Africa.</p>
                        <p>1. Begin summary: Representatives of five Western states met in
                            Washington on January 21, 1978 to discuss the conflict in the Horn of
                            Africa. The senior participants were Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Richard Moose</persName> for the United States,
                            Assistant Under Secretary Philip Mansfield for the United Kingdom,
                            Director of African and Malagasy Affairs Guy Georgy for France, Deputy
                            Assistant Secretary Helmut Mueller for the Federal Republic of Germany,
                            and Counselor of Embassy Giancarlo Carrara-Cagni for Italy. Group
                            concluded that time had come to press for a negotiated solution based on
                            an autonomous Ogaden to reflect interests of inhabitants, combined with
                            Somali Government withdrawal from Ethiopian territory. Group noted
                            recent Soviet approach to French along these lines, and participants
                            agreed to explore this possibility with concerned states. British
                            expressed interest in pursuing <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss>
                            resolution. Consensus was that peaceful resolution of crisis depended on
                            departure of <gloss target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss> forces from Ogaden.
                            End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Present military situation: It was agreed that during the present
                            relative battlefield lull the Somalis were preparing for at least one
                            more attack on Harar and perhaps Dire Dawa. The Somalis were credited
                            with high morale, but their air defense capability was weak. They had
                            probably less than a fifty percent chance of success. While it was
                            believed that Government of the Somali Democratic Republic (<gloss
                                target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss>) had had some success in arranging
                            for light arms, no participant believed <gloss target="#t_GSDR_1"
                                >GSDR</gloss> had been able to obtain quantities of heavy or
                            sophisticated weapons needed to counterbalance longer term Soviet
                            supplies to Ethiopian Provisional Military Government (<gloss
                                target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> has established general air
                            superiority and succeeded in carrying out air raids on Hargeisa and
                            Berbera, but troop morale remains low and discipline and command/control
                            structures are weak. According to US analysis, Ethiopian Air Force, with
                            Cuban and Soviet support and possibly some degree of participation, will
                            be able to <pb n="99" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_99"/>launch an expanded air
                            offensive by early February, and launch counterattacks of less than full
                            scale between now and May. It is unlikely <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1"
                                >EPMG</gloss> can launch a successful general counterattack before
                            June. (Mueller pointed out that air attacks against Somali population
                            centers might have a serious effect on President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s position. Germans have been
                            told that a number of young Somali military officers had opposed
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s anti-Soviet
                            moves.)</p>
                        <p>4. Probable objectives of an Ethiopian counter-offensive: US
                            representatives have been assured by <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                                >Mengistu</persName> that <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>
                            does not consider Somali territory to be a military objective and
                            Soviets have said that <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> has
                            pledged not to use Soviet equipment outside of Ethiopia. Although these
                            assurances might be worth little in the heat of battle, <gloss
                                target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> might be deterred from crossing into
                            Somalia by knowledge that such a move would cost them the diplomatic
                            advantage gained as defenders of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            principle of territorial integrity, and might, in addition, bring other
                            countries (such as Iran) to reverse their present position of holding
                            back moral and material support from <gloss target="#t_GSDR_1"
                                >GSDR</gloss>. However, it was also noted that difficulty of
                            retaking Ogaden might bring <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss>
                            nonetheless to strike into northern Somalia in order to bargain for
                            Somali withdrawal from Ogaden. Concern was also expressed over
                            possibility that <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> might carry out
                            grave reprisals against Ogaden population during reconquest.</p>
                        <p>5. Status of current mediation efforts: Somalis are publicly pledged to
                            negotiate in any suitable place (i.e. anywhere but Addis Ababa or
                            Moscow), and without preconditions, but we have no indication that they
                            have begun seriously to think about the outlines of a negotiated
                            solution. It was agreed that the Ethiopian position remains that
                            negotiations must be preceded by withdrawal of all <gloss
                                target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss> forces from Ethiopian territory.
                            However, <gloss target="#t_EPMG_1">EPMG</gloss> representative has said
                            his government was studying ways to implement the policy of autonomy for
                            the various “nationalities”.</p>
                        <p>6. While Nigerian/<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> effort has made no
                            progress, Nigerians are now canvassing the eight nation <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> commission to see if there is
                            agreement on inviting Somalia and Ethiopia to meet in Lagos in February.
                            The Madagascar negotiation initiative seems to have foundered, although
                            Ethiopian and Somali delegations have both (separately) visited
                            Antananarivo. The French representative said that Ratsiraka had
                            reportedly succeeded in arranging a meeting between <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                                >Mengistu</persName>, but that the meeting had failed because of
                            Soviet opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>7. Elements of a possible negotiated solution: While admitting that the
                            prospects for a negotiated solution were not good, it was agreed that a
                            basis for compromise might be found between the Ethiopian stated policy
                            promising the various Ethiopian “nationalities” the right <pb n="100"
                                facs="0135" xml:id="pg_100"/>to self-determination and
                            self-government in autonomous regions, and the Somali Government’s
                            assertion that all it seeks is self-determination of the Ogadeni-Somali
                            people. The establishment of a largely autonomous government of the
                            region of the Ogaden which maintained a continuing link with the Addis
                            regime might satisfy the Ethiopian desire to preserve its sovereignty
                            over the area while providing the Ogadenis sufficient control over their
                            affairs to induce Somalia to abandon its goal of incorporating the
                            Ogaden. The arrangement would presumably require some form of guarantee,
                            whether by the UN, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> or a joint
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>/Arab League undertaking. Before
                            any negotiation of the form of government could take place, the fighting
                            would have to be stopped, by ceasefire or perhaps by recognition of a
                            stalemate. Ethiopia would not agree to a simple ceasefire in place, but
                            insists that Somalia’s forces be withdrawn. Somalia would not agree to
                            withdrawal of its forces, at least until it was confident that the
                            members of the Western Somali Liberation Front and, indeed, the
                            non-combatant Somali inhabitants of the Ogaden would be protected from
                            Ethiopian reprisals. It would therefore appear necessary for a neutral
                            peacekeeping force supplemented by a neutral administrative body to
                            monitor the withdrawal of Somali Government forces and to administer the
                            Ogaden until a negotiated settlement had been reached.<note n="5"

                            Ambassador and Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> during which <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"

                            settlement might be achieved. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> proposed 4-point approach:</p>
                        <p>(A) Somali Government to announce its willingness to withdraw troops from
                            Ogaden in two weeks;</p>
                        <p>(B) Ethiopia and Somalia undertake thereafter to sit down to work out a
                            settlement;</p>
                        <p>(C) Settlement would affirm respect for existing borders;</p>
                        <p>(D) Settlement would provide for an autonomous state for the population
                            of the Ogaden in “confederation” with Ethiopia. In response to question,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> did not rule out
                            possibility that a neutral peacekeeping force such as UN could be
                            inserted between contending sides to ensure against Ethiopian reprisal
                            attacks on Ogadeni population. Meeting noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> intervention obviously
                            planned with quinquepartite meeting next day in mind and might be a ruse
                            to keep West off balance, but was nonetheless worth probing, since under
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> formulation Somali
                            troop withdrawal would take place only following an Ethiopian

                            the problem of the Horn was primarily a geopolitical one—Soviet
                            penetration of an area of importance to the West and to the Arab world
                            from which the Soviets have been almost entirely excluded. Soviet
                            military supplies are being furnished Ethiopia in amounts in excess of
                            what would be needed for the Ogaden war, and will serve Soviet strategic
                            advantage in consolidating a position first in an Ethiopia where the old
                            elites—the Westernized intellectuals, the clergy, and the

                        discussed and opportunities for improvement in collection were considered.

                        that the U.S. Government should be cautious about taking actions that would
                        in themselves encourage a sense of crisis or confrontation with the Soviets
                        or that would commit us prematurely to positions that could limit our
                        flexibility. It was agreed that the following principles should guide
                        actions during the next few weeks:</p>
                    <p>• We will continue efforts to impress upon the Soviets the seriousness with
                        which we look upon their involvement in the Horn and the political problems
                        which it causes for us.</p>
                    <p>• We will endeavor to broaden contact and dialogue with the Ethiopians in
                        hope of encouraging them to reserve some freedom of action.</p>
                    <p>• We will continue to seek advice from our allies and other friendly
                        governments to enlist their aid in impressing upon the Soviets &amp;
                            Cubans<note n="5" xml:id="d46fn5">

                        encouraging those who are inclined to help the Somalis to make commitments
                        that they would expect us to back up.</p>
                    <p>• We will accelerate study of our own capabilities and those of other
                        governments to intervene in the situation in ways that could complicate or
                        make more costly the Soviet/Cuba intervention, but we will underwrite no
                        action at this time.</p>
                    <p>• We will consider underscoring our concern by military movements designed to
                        have psychological and political impact.</p>
                    <p>The following specific requirements were set for study/action with results to
                        be reported back as soon as possible:</p>

                            >Obasanjo</persName>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Thank you very much for your letter of January 16 on the death of Senator
                        Humphrey. I have conveyed your gracious sentiments to Mrs. Humphrey; we
                        mourn his loss, but we will remain buoyed by his spirit and his example.</p>
                    <p>We are disturbed about the continuation of the conflict in the Horn and
                        particularly about the implications of present Soviet and Cuban action in
                        Ethiopia. Information has reached us that heavy shipments of weapons and
                        military personnel are being sent to Ethiopia and that large numbers of
                        additional Cuban troops are expected soon and may enter active fighting.</p>
                    <p>As you and I discussed in Washington,<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> visited Washington
                            October 10–13, 1977. Documentation on the visit is printed in <ref

                                2, Sub-Saharan Africa</ref>.</note> the United States supports the
                        principle of territorial integrity, and I have so stated publicly. We do not
                        question the right of Ethiopia to call for assistance in self-defense
                        against an attack on its soil, but Soviet and Cuban support, which seems
                        excessive, is not being provided in a way that encourages settlement of
                        underlying issues; instead it exacerbates them. This is especially true in
                        Eritrea, where the prospect of full Soviet backing discourages <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> from seeking a negotiated
                        settlement that could preserve Ethiopian sovereignty and bring this long,
                        bloody conflict to an end. Not only are we concerned that Soviet and Cuban
                        involvement is encouraging Africans to go on killing Africans; we fear that
                        the Soviets and Cubans are trying to establish themselves permanently in
                        Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>The United States is prepared to support a significant political initiative
                        to find a just and peaceful solution to the problems of the Horn. I
                        understand that you may soon be in direct contact with Ethiopia concerning a
                        possible settlement, and that you also will make more <pb n="110"

                        or negotiation. Your efforts have been and will be valuable in establishing
                        a climate for peace. I have publicly urged negotiations under <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> auspices and will continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>We consider it highly desirable for this conflict in Africa to be resolved by
                        African procedures and principles, and not by the actions of outside
                        governments, particularly the superpowers. There are pressures on us from
                        many quarters to be more active. We do not want to act in any way that is
                        not in harmony with basic African interests and perceptions. We will exert
                        ourselves to support your initiative.</p>
                    <p>I regard your initiative and leadership as crucial. I very much look forward
                        to my forthcoming trip to Lagos when we can discuss these matters at length.
                        In the meantime, please let me have your personal advice and counsel.</p>

                        want to ask the President to consider:</p>
                    <p>a. When we keep attacking the Cubans and Soviets for sending more troops into
                        Ethiopia—especially when we do so in <hi rend="italic">official</hi>
                        statements and declarations of <hi rend="italic">high-level U.S.
                            officials</hi>—we make it possible for the Ethiopians who want to think
                        the worst of us and the Soviets who are advising them to claim that we are
                        against Ethiopia’s defending its own territorial integrity. We also give
                        them reason to suspect that <pb n="111" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_111"/>we are
                        utilizing our presence in the embassy in Addis primarily to gather
                        intelligence which we then immediately use against them—this fortifies the
                        argument that it would be best to kick us out entirely.</p>
                    <p>b. Furthermore, on the concrete topic of source protection—our sources, when
                        they hear their information coming back so directly get wary and concerned
                        about giving us more.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> suggests that we could be more
                        effective publicizing such information covertly from various places
                        abroad—it calls attention to the same problem without implicating the U.S.
                        Government directly in the action. State would like to see the publicizing
                        of this information stretched out over a longer period of time but also
                        points out that statements such as this seem to go contrary to the
                        conclusions reached in last Thursday’s <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>

                        about not giving each increase in numbers of Cubans or Soviets so much
                        publicity that the press continually concentrates on this subject and
                        dramatizes the problem of the Horn in ways that can generate pressures on
                        the Administration that may eventually become very uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p>As you know, I am not normally inclined toward passivity on topics such as
                        this, but here I think both <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and State
                        have a point and the President’s tendency to want to see this sort of thing
                        publicized needs to be tempered by more careful consideration of the
                        unintended consequences as well as the longer-range results we wish to
                        achieve . . .</p>

                    <p>Two of the specific requirements set forth for action in your memorandum of
                        27 January 1978,<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">See <ref target="#d46">Document
                                46</ref>.</note> subject as above, differ somewhat from my
                        recollection of what it was decided to do. The first has to do with planning
                        for deployment of a naval task force to the Red Sea as soon as possible. I
                        believe we were talking about the Indian Ocean and not the Red Sea.
                        Additionally, I reported that we had a naval task force about to deploy on a
                        normal routine deployment to the Indian Ocean. That deployment is currently
                        scheduled for the period 20 February to 18 April. The task force will be
                        made up of one cruiser, two frigates, and one oiler. I suggest for the time
                        being that is all we will want to do in the way of actual deployment of a
                        naval task force in the area, though we will continue to examine further
                        options for possible later use.</p>
                    <p>The second concern I have is of lesser importance. It calls for going through
                        military [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to sound
                        out the Iranian, Saudi, Egyptian and Sudanese governments on the support of
                        Somalia. It should, I assume, read military intelligence channels. I propose
                        to carry out this action through defense attaches, although I am not
                        optimistic that they will obtain much useful information.</p>

                    <p>The record of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting shows that we
                        talked about naval movements in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Indian Ocean
                        and the Red Sea. It was noted that there were already plans for naval
                        movements into the northwestern sector of the Indian Ocean in the next few
                        weeks. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">George Brown</persName> also stated that
                        it would be relatively easy to move some vessels from the Mediterranean down
                        the Red Sea. I think we should <hi rend="italic">study</hi> movements we
                        could make both in the Indian Ocean (especially the Gulf of Aden) and the
                        Red Sea. We do not want to decide now, however, what to do—we simply want to
                        know what is feasible and how much time it would take.</p>

                        where the Agency stands in its efforts to provide covert action support on
                        issues relating to Soviet-Cuban intervention in the Horn of Africa. As you
                        know, this matter was discussed at the Special Coordination Committee
                            (<gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>) meeting on 26 January 1978<note

                        in regard to a draft “Perspectives” dealing with the situation in
                            Ethiopia.<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">The draft Perspectives detailed
                            ideas for exploiting low morale in the Ethiopian Armed Forces,
                            exacerbating tensions between Ethiopians and the Soviets/Cubans, and
                            advertising Soviet interventionism. (National Security Council, Carter

                    <p>2. As you know the Department of Justice (<gloss target="#t_DOJ_1"
                            >DOJ</gloss>) has questioned the legal sufficiency of “Perspectives”
                        under the Hughes/Ryan amendment<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">The Hughes/Ryan
                            Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 (P.L. 93–559) requires

                                >CIA</gloss> covert operations within a set time period. It also
                            stipulates that appropriated funds may not be used for covert operations
                            without a Presidential Finding.</note> and has recommended that
                        henceforth “Perspectives” be approved by the President. Our past practice
                        has been to coordinate these guidelines with the Department of State only.
                        In order to remedy this problem the Agency has prepared and submitted to
                        you, for approval by the President, two new Presidential findings covering
                        our international covert action infrastructure and the “Perspectives”

                    <p>3. Under the <gloss target="#t_DOJ_1">DOJ</gloss> opinion we are now in a
                        period of legal limbo insofar as current tasking of the <pb n="115"

                        procedure. Briefly, the situation now is that we may only task the
                        infrastructure under “Perspectives” guidelines previously approved under the
                        old procedure.</p>
                    <p>4. In this regard, there are aspects of the Ethiopia/Horn situation which we
                        are exploiting in the interim under policy authority contained in two
                        currently valid “Perspectives”: (1) “Drawing Attention to Soviet Activity in
                        the Horn of Africa” (approved 20 September 1977)<note n="6" xml:id="d52fn6"
                            >This Perspectives deals with publicizing the Soviet role in arming both
                            Somalia and Ethiopia and fueling the conflict in the Horn of Africa.

                            Box 27, Folder 13: Covert Action)</note> These “Perspectives” allow us
                        to pursue two of the five objectives stated in the draft endorsed by the
                            <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>, namely:</p>
                    <p>a. “Mobilize international criticism against the interventionist role of the
                        Soviet Union and Cuba in the Horn of Africa, particularly citing problems
                        this is creating in Ethiopia,” and</p>
                    <p>b. “Encourage states, particularly in Africa, to pursue energetically a
                        ceasefire and mediation of the Ethiopian/Somali dispute.”</p>
                    <p>5. Even here, however, the covert action authority is cramped because the two
                        valid “Perspectives” were written before events in Ethiopia loomed so large.
                        For example, we can discuss Ethiopia only in connection with earlier
                        developments in Somalia. We have no policy authority for covert action
                        involving the other three external objectives cited in the draft Ethiopia
                        “Perspectives,” namely:</p>
                    <p>a. “Support the U.S. role of impartial but concerned party who is seeking to
                        establish a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement,”</p>
                    <p>b. “Stimulate foreign governments to deny use of local facilities and passage
                        privileges to the Soviet Union and other powers engaged in transferring
                        military equipment and troops to the Horn region,” and</p>
                    <p>c. “Promote a greater public awareness in Cuba of the political and economic
                        consequences of Cuba’s African adventures.”</p>
                    <p>5. In addition to the currently valid “Perspectives” guidelines on issues in
                        the Horn, we also have a Presidential finding covering covert action on the
                        issue of Soviet-Cuban military intervention in Angola in response to which
                        our infrastructure assets have been very active since November 1977.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>In this memorandum we review briefly the capabilities (not the intentions) of
                        Egypt, Iran, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia to provide combat assistance to Somalia
                        and give some indication as to the impact that various levels of assistance
                        would have on the military balance in the Horn.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Capabilities</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Egyptians</hi> undoubtedly have the best troops
                        available for an expeditionary force. Egypt’s Army is combat seasoned and
                        displayed unexpected flexibility in moving from its normal Suez Canal
                        positions to the Western Military District in the fighting against Libya
                        last July. It is also large enough to spare a few brigades without
                        jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Iranian</hi> Army is well-equipped and trained but has
                        had less combat experience than the Egyptian. Iran is, however, in a far
                        better position than any other state in the area to provide a wide range of
                        air support. It would need, however, to use its American equipment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sudanese</hi> forces are less capable in all aspects than
                        either the Egyptians or the Iranians. The small Sudanese forces are poorly
                        trained and marginally equipped.</p>
                    <pb n="117" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_117"/>
                    <p>Any <hi rend="italic">Saudi Arabian</hi> forces would be strictly symbolic.
                        Saudi support would probably be restricted to political, financial, and
                        material assistance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact of Advisors and Technical Assistance</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">A few hundred technical and military advisors from Iran
                            and/or Egypt with special emphasis on air defenses, communications, and
                            security.</hi> Such a force would be mainly symbolic, with little
                        military impact.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">A specific, well-qualified technical support package from
                            the same states to perform tasks such as defending Berbera from air
                            attacks or providing air defenses for several important
                            installations.</hi> Such a force would require possibly as many as a
                        thousand advisors.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">A larger number of technical and military advisors
                            covering a wide spectrum of activity, such as training and assisting the
                            Somalis in using air defense weapons.</hi> Together, Egypt and Iran have
                        significant numbers of trained, reasonably qualified personnel. The
                        Egyptians would be best in areas such as air defenses and defensive tactics.
                        The Iranians would probably perform better in supply, communications, and
                        other non-combat roles. An advisory group of such a magnitude would release
                        Somali troops for front-line service, raise the quality of training
                        throughout the Somali armed forces, and provide a timely psychological
                        boost.</p>

                        could protect Somalia, they would not provide air security for their forces

                        units could make Ethiopian/Cuban air attacks so costly that they would no
                        longer play a significant role in the fighting.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">A similar <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> force, but
                            backed up by a few squadrons of combat aircraft.</hi> This would give
                        the Somalis air superiority. Egypt, Iran, and possibly Saudi Arabia could
                        embark on such a venture. However, the deployment of even two-three
                        squadrons would seriously erode Egyptian air defenses and have serious
                        logistics and support restraints. Iran could provide a squadron or two of
                        highly effective combat aircraft for operations in Somalia and has had
                        experience in limited deployment operations. Saudi Arabia could provide
                        aircraft for operations in Somalia but only a dozen or so because of its
                        limited support infrastructure.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact of Ground Combat Units</p>

                        brigades that would be well-suited to such a task. Egyptian forces have
                        significant combat experience and would probably at least match an
                        equivalent number of Cuban forces—and be clearly superior to Ethiopian
                        forces. It would require 5,000 men to support a combat brigade
                        adequately.</p>

                            from Iran—totaling about 20,000 men.</hi> Support and logistics for such
                        a large force would be a nightmare and would require enormous investments.
                        If these problems could be solved, the well-equipped Iranians and the
                        experienced Egyptians would give the Somalis clear superiority over their
                        opponents for some months, even if Ethiopian mobilization and re-equipment
                        continued at the current high pace, and of course assuming that the Cuban
                        build-up does not go beyond 5,000–10,000 men.</p>

                    <p>Both Egypt and Iran have adequate transport aircraft to ferry men and
                        equipment to Somalia and could start deployments very quickly. Sudan has no
                        real airlift ability, and if it were to participate would require airlift
                        assistance. Airlift assets available to the Egyptian, Iranian, and Saudi Air

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Personally, I am quite willing to let events take their course as
                            regards the Soviet role in the region. I think they will gain little
                            from their efforts in the short run and probably be heavy losers in the
                            not distant future (i.e., less than five years). As long as <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> is not desperate, he is not
                            going to be a Soviet toady. Also, I dispute the idea that the Horn is of
                            notable strategic value unless you are going to fight World War II over
                            again. I do not believe that any likely US policy course will result in
                            the Finlandization of Saudi Arabia, and think that we have quite a bit
                            to gain internationally by standing above the battle.</p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_126"/>
                        <p>2. These views may not be universally held (although they find
                            substantial support among those of us involved in North-South matters).
                            Whether or not they are accepted may not matter all that much; the
                            constraints imposed by our capabilities to act decisively may lead us to
                            much the same courses of action as would a relaxed attitude.</p>
                        <p>3. We do not have domestic support for a dramatic involvement in the
                            Horn. Most of those who would berate us for our weakness vis-a-vis the
                            Soviets will quickly get under the table if the question of personnel or
                            large-scale military assistance arises. The <hi rend="italic">worst</hi>
                            thing that can happen to this administration, abroad and at home, is to
                            be seen as ineffective—i.e., talking big and not being able to follow
                            up.</p>
                        <p>4. We seem to have two principal goals:</p>
                        <p>—Increase the cost the Soviets and Cubans will have to pay to enhance
                            their position, and keep them from enhancing it to the extent
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>—Prevent a Somali collapse, either through invasion or subversion. Note
                            that a Somali victory is not among our interests.</p>
                        <p>5. We need to define a rhetorical and political position that will help
                            us achieve these ends with minimum involvement on our part. We should
                            stake out the high ground clearly by saying:</p>
                        <p>—We do not and have never supported Somali territorial aspirations.</p>
                        <p>—We stand by the principle of inviolability of African borders—and this
                            includes the Somalis’ own border.</p>
                        <p>—We urge great power restraint; preferably this means non-involvement.
                            When there is involvement it must be proportionate. We reluctantly
                            accept the fact of the Soviets helping the Ethiopians. We do not accept,
                            however, the massive scale of the involvement which raises questions as
                            to ultimate Soviet intentions.</p>
                        <p>—We should emphasize the role of regional responsibility; in the first
                            instance the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> mediation
                            responsibility; in the second instance, the role of neighboring states
                            to assist Somalia if it is attacked.</p>
                        <p>6. A prerequisite to any effective action along the above lines is the
                            withdrawal of Somali forces from Ethiopia, or at least a general
                            perception that withdrawal is about to be effected by one means or the
                            other.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactics</p>
                        <p>7. A major difficulty in pursuing our propaganda line will be to convey
                            an adequate picture of Soviet involvement without creating unnecessary
                            pressures here at home or among allies. The matter should be approached
                            with calm and dignity—more sorrow than anger. The danger is not to us or
                            to our interests but to Africa, to the states of the <pb n="127"
                                facs="0162" xml:id="pg_127"/>general region and to world stability.
                            For domestic consumption we point out that the President is determined
                            not to get us bogged down.</p>
                        <p>8. While we have an interest in raising the cost of involvement to the
                            Soviets, this should not entail attempts to prolong the fighting in the
                            hope of getting the Soviets enmired in a mini-Vietnam. The main cost of
                            such a policy would be in terms of the lives of Ethiopians and Somalis,
                            and there is no US interest at stake that would permit us to do that in
                            good conscience.</p>
                        <p>9. In addressing the international audience, the cost to the Soviets can
                            be raised by a vigorous propaganda campaign. For example, we should be
                            getting pictures of Soviet ships ferrying troops to Ethiopia and
                            flooding the European and Third World media with them. We would
                            emphasize not the threat to the US but the disproportionate and
                            dangerous nature of the Soviet response. There will be unhelpful
                            playback at home, but this can be attenuated by the same themes. (We
                            need not respond as forcefully to Soviet bad behavior if it is not a
                            direct threat to us.)</p>
                        <p>10. Overall, our tactics should be aimed for maximum effect when our
                            political position will be strongest—i.e., when the Somalis are out of
                            Ethiopia, which is likely to be sooner rather than later.</p>
                        <p>11. We should be very receptive to the idea of going to the UN Security
                            Council. Our hands are clean and the Soviets’ are not. Even the Somalis
                            will look good once they have pulled back. (There is a certain
                            similarity to the role of North Korea before and after it was driven
                            back behind the 38th Parallel.) There is a threat to the peace and this
                            is just the kind of thing that the Security Council should be
                            discussing. Obviously it should look to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> as its instrument <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> could be effective. “Meddling” by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> plus a Somali withdrawal
                            might provide the context to galvanize the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. If we are going to help the Somalis, it should be through third
                            country transfers. Indeed, the current situation raises questions as to
                            whether our self-imposed limitations on third country transfers make
                            sense. There are certain things that we should help other people to do
                            that we would not be willing to do ourselves. We should not unduly tie
                            their (and our own) hands. Quite aside from the immediate situation,
                            this is a policy that we should review.</p>
                        <p>13. Finally, we should design policies that will give Ethiopia a maximum
                            amount of incentive and flexibility in the short and mid-term to shift
                            away from the Soviets. Pressure is one aspect of this, but it must be
                            accompanied by clear indications that we are not unalterably opposed to
                            vital Ethiopian interests. In other words, we must not become totally
                            identified with the Somali cause. (The Arabs were able to diversify only
                            after it became clear to them that we were not committed to Israel 150
                            percent.)</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> came in at our
                        request February 14. The discussion covered the following matters:</p>

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi>. The Secretary spoke of the mounting US
                        concern over the course of events, and the need for prompt movement toward a
                        ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. He expressed the belief that the time
                        had come to work through the UN Security Council, and reported that he had
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andrew Young</persName> to talk about
                        this with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TOA_1">Troyanovsky</persName> in

                        response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        about the results expected from a Security Council discussion, the Secretary
                        listed the following: ceasefire; recognition of international boundaries;
                        withdrawal of the Somalis from the Ogaden; withdrawal of all foreign troops,
                        including Soviet and Cuban, from Ethiopia and Somalia; and the beginning of
                        steps leading toward a negotiated solution. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> expressed the view that there should be an
                        immediate appeal for a Somali withdrawal, since this was, in the Soviet
                        view, a precondition for the other steps. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> asked who should take the initiatives in calling
                        for an SC meeting. The Secretary said it would be best if Nigeria or Gabon
                        did so, since an African initiative would not make it appear that the UN was
                        taking matters out of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> hands, but that
                        we would do so if necessary. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> said it should not appear to be a Soviet-American
                        confrontation, and the Secretary agreed that an African initiative would be
                        better from this point of view as well.</p>
                    <pb n="129" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_129"/>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized the importance of a firm commitment that the
                        Ethiopians and the Cubans would not cross into Somali territory, and the
                        serious consequences that would follow if they did. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated the assurances of the
                        Ethiopians on this point, and added that Raul Castro had also made it clear
                        during his visit to Moscow that the Cuban forces had no intention of moving
                        into Somali territory. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> did
                        not dispute the assertion that the Cubans were participating in the
                        fighting, but insisted that Soviet personnel were not doing so.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would transmit the
                        message to Moscow, and could not anticipate what its reaction would be to
                        the Security Council move.<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">In a meeting with

                        of Somali intention to withdraw might suffice to start the process, if it
                        were given without conditions, and if the withdrawal were to be completed
                        within a definite time period, such as two weeks.</p>

                        but familiar and not particularly vindictive in tone. My responses were
                        direct as planned. The concluding portion of the meeting was clearly upbeat
                        and positive.</p>
                    <p>2. Main highlights: <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> asked
                        that I personally convey to President his assurances that Ethiopia has no
                        intention of crossing Somalia’s borders, nor has Ethiopia any intention of
                        interfering in other countries’ affairs, that Cuban and Soviet forces had
                        come only to help Ethiopia and Ethiopia would not permit them to use
                        Ethiopia as a base for intervention in neighboring countries.</p>
                    <p>3. In response to my strong characterization of destabilizing effect of Cuban
                        and Soviet combat forces remaining in region and my stress on fact that this
                        caused deep concern to US and other countries of the area, he said he
                        understood this concern and wished to reassure US that Ethiopia did not
                        regard these forces as a permanent feature of the area, but as temporary
                        though necessary forces to enable Ethiopia to overcome the effects of Somali
                        aggression. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s purpose was
                        clearly not to further strain relations but to keep open channels of
                        communication and to balance Soviets to some extent. Key at this point is
                        clearly to get Somalis out of Ogaden. Otherwise <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> determined to push them out despite risks of wider
                        conflict. He appreciated clarification that our approach is ceasefire linked
                        with withdrawal and negotiation aimed not at leaving Somali forces in place
                        but at stabilizing situation after withdrawal. From his reactions, there may
                        be some possibility of negotiation along these lines.</p>

                        and had maintained communication with the Ethiopian Government. His
                        conversations had been very frank yet cordial. The Ethiopian strategic
                        objective in receiving him had been to hold open a channel of communications
                        and to work both sides (the United States and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>). Their tactical objective was to keep the United States
                        from supporting Somalia in the Ogaden. Also, he believed the Ethiopians were
                        reluctant to see the Soviets regain their position in Somalia and noted that
                        the Ethiopians had in the recent past rejected a regional confederation

                        First, depending upon the agreements, our bilateral agreements would need to

                        the Saudis and make the following points:</p>
                    <p>—To provide evidence that U.S. origin arms have been provided by Saudi Arabia
                        to Somalia and to express our concern about such transfers which are
                        contrary to our bilateral agreements.</p>
                    <p>—To emphasize that such transfers could have a seriously adverse impact on
                        F–15s for Saudi Arabia.</p>
                    <p>—To explain that we have no objection to supplying non-U.S. origin equipment
                        to Somalia (particularly anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons).</p>
                    <p>—To advise that if Somalia is threatened with invasion after withdrawal from
                        the Ogaden, the Administration would initiate action to provide third
                        country arms transfers.</p>

                        </hi> observed that the F–15s give us leverage with the Saudis. We should
                        enlist their help in getting Somalia to withdraw, after which we would
                        arrange arms transfers. He added, however, that all of this must happen very

                        victory will be difficult for them. Saudi money for arms will help in this
                        regard.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>
                        </hi> said the task force could attack them but that he did not favor
                        attacking forces crossing the border with the U.S. task force. He suggested
                        that one alternative would be to go to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and
                        suggest that they put a force into Somalia to deter Ethiopia from crossing
                        the border and to support <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad-Barre</persName>
                        politically. We would send a task force to keep the Russians from attacking
                        arms transfers shipments. He added, however, that there are two problems. If
                        the countries in the region put forces into Somalia and then the Ethiopians
                        come across the border and “kick the shit out of those forces,” what do we
                        do? Also, we will be asked about equipment. Do we authorize the use of U.S.
                        equipment? The Secretary indicated that he would have said yes, until Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> spelled out how
                        complicated that is. He would, however, favor replacement of equipment sent
                        to Somalia but this would require the permission of Congress. He concluded
                        that as long as Somalia is in the Ogaden there will be no support. With this
                        truth, no one will send help.</p>

                        </hi> said that a task force would have two purposes. The first would be to
                        help Arab forces in Somalia but he added that this would appear to be a
                        non-starter. Second, we could encourage Saudi Arabia to provide equipment,
                        emphasizing that we are concerned and share their interest in not having
                        Somalia overrun. They and others might deter the Ethiopians, once victorious
                        in the Ogaden, from spilling over into Somalia. In these circumstances, a
                        task force could be a <pb n="139" facs="0174" xml:id="pg_139"/>confidence
                        building measure, encouraging countries in the region that the U.S. is
                        present, stands with them, will protect the flow of arms, and will provide
                        protection from the Russians.</p>

                        with the air threat, that is, the Cuban-flown MIGs. Thus, we might consider
                        a carrier in the context of asking <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"

                        country from the border. In this event, we would move a carrier into the

                        that we would guarantee his territorial integrity and fight the Cubans.</p>

                        In the latter case, the task force would make no difference; the former was
                        politically indefensible.</p>

                        </hi> said the task force should be there for political reasons, to make
                        clear the serious consequences of an invasion. Also, it would provide
                        military support if the Iranians or other outsiders provide air cover for
                        Somalia. We should not engage the Ethiopians or Cubans directly. This would
                        give confidence of U.S. support.</p>

                    <p>—We should approach the Saudis, Iranians, and Pakistanis to point out that
                        arms transfers of U.S. origin are illegal, that such illegal assistance
                        could have a serious impact on future U.S. arms sales, that we do not object
                        to their providing non-U.S. origin equipment to Somalia and that we would

                        with invasion after withdrawing from the Ogaden.</p>

                        powers; and</p>

                    <p>Soviet General <persName corresp="#p_PVI_1">Petrov</persName> is “almost
                        entirely” in control of military planning for Ethiopian and Cuban forces in

                        military planning group (Soviets, Cubans and Ethiopians) and does not have
                        to coordinate his decisions with, or seek approval from, Addis Ababa.
                        According to the source, <persName corresp="#p_PVI_1">Petrov</persName>

                        military operations in the Third World heretofore was in Egypt during the
                        1969–1970 War of Attrition. At that time, Soviet air units operated under
                        Soviet command against Israeli deep penetration raids, but there was no real
                        question of Soviet control over Egyptian ground forces. Nor in Angola was
                        there evidence that Soviet military personnel played more than an advisory

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Horn</hi>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"
                            >Addou</persName> of Somalia called on me this afternoon with a
                        “critical” message from <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad Barre</persName>.
                        He said that a majority of Somali military officers had called upon
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad Barre</persName> to open a dialogue
                        with the Soviet Union in view of the military situation. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad Barre</persName> had refused and said this would
                        never happen while he was President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> made two requests: One, that
                        the United States authorize third country transfer of U.S. arms urgently to
                        Somalia. Second, that President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad
                            Barre</persName> be invited to the U.S. in order to show he had some
                        moral support. I asked if <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad Barre</persName>
                        was prepared to withdraw his troops into Somalia or to state that he was
                        going to do so in conjunction with requesting arms. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> replied indirectly that the arms
                        request was without reference to a Somali withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> said a senior Minister and the
                        Somali Ambassador to the U.S. had been dispatched to Lagos to request that
                            <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> urge <persName

                        delegation was authorized to enter into talks with an Ethiopian delegation
                        also expected in Lagos.</p>

                        conveyed to you his assurances that Ethiopia does not intend to cross the
                        Somali frontier.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"

                                57</ref>.</note> Such assurances would appear to be fairly strong;
                        however, there have been several recent clandestine reports which refer to
                        joint Ethiopian-Soviet planning of military operations that would involve
                        incursions into Somali territory, including the occupation of areas of
                        northern Somalia. One such report in particular, from a source with
                        reportedly excellent access, has informed us that if the Somalis <pb n="146"
                            facs="0181" xml:id="pg_146"/>do not withdraw from all Ethiopian
                        territory the Ethiopians are prepared to move into Somali territory, with
                        Soviet concurrence.</p>
                    <p>There are several possible explanations for such reports of Ethiopian
                        planning for a frontier crossing. They could be, but are not necessarily, in
                        conflict with <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s assurances,
                        for various reasons. Moreover, the phraseology “with Soviet concurrence” may
                        not necessarily mean that the Soviets have already given their agreement to
                        an Ethiopian move into Somalia, but rather “provided that the Soviets gave
                        their concurrence”.</p>
                    <p>At this time, our judgment is that <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> would prefer not to cross the Somali border if he
                        could achieve the withdrawal of the Somalis from Ethiopian territory by some
                        other means. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                        >Mengistu</persName>’s decision will probably depend on whether or not he
                        believes such a move would be necessary to get Somali forces out of <hi
                            rend="italic">all</hi> of the Ogaden. If there appeared to be no other
                        way to achieve this objective, we believe that he probably would be prepared
                        to cross the border.</p>

                    <p>(1) Ethiopians would seek to limit their concessions to granting a measure of

                    <p>Addis prefers Outcome A—military solution achieved within Ethiopian borders.
                        Given the increasing levels of Soviet and Cuban aid, this outcome appears
                        probable. Ethiopia would maintain its sovereign right as a nation seeking to
                        repel invaders and inviting Soviet/Cuban aid to achieve that goal. Should
                        Ethiopian forces cross the border, however, this argument by Addis would be
                        less defensible.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Outcome C(2) is probably the only solution acceptable to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, who would prefer a military defeat
                        (e.g., a “retreat” under military pressure) and the expulsion of Somali
                        forces from the Ogaden (which he can pin on Soviet/Cuban intervention)
                        rather than any concession to continued Ethiopian domination of the Ogaden
                        Somalia, whether or not they were granted greater local autonomy. Any
                        negotiated solution other than C(2) would be viewed as a political defeat
                        for Somalia and for <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> personally,
                        who would then be vulnerable to the charge of leading Somalia into a war
                        which led to a formal surrender to Ethiopia of Somali claims in the
                        Ogaden.</p>

                    <p>Outcome A—a military solution achieved within Ethiopian boundaries, would be
                        the most advantageous to the Soviets, who could con<pb n="148" facs="0183"

                        legitimized by military tactics or not, would turn African opinion against
                        Moscow and could bring Arab and Iranian intervention, escalating the
                        conflict and possibly sanctioning UN intervention. If the majority of
                        African states were opposed to the Soviets’ role in any Ethiopian invasion
                        of Somalia, then the Soviets would not want to risk UN consideration of the

                    </p>
                    <p>Outcome C(1)—a negotiated solution, which reconciles the competing principles
                        of “territorial integrity”—supported unequivocally by the <gloss

                        nation)—with our less vigorous support for the right of self-determination
                        under the UN Charter, is the solution sought by the United States, first in
                        its backing of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> initiative led by
                        Nigeria, and more recently, the UN initiative. Our recent UN initiative
                        seeking UN sanction for a negotiated solution has been resisted by the
                        principal actors for a number of reasons:</p>
                    <p>(1) The African nations are opposed because (a) they are not convinced that
                        their <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> effort has failed; and (b)
                        because such an initiative might show African divisiveness (i.e., a
                        pro-Western <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. pro-Soviet alignment) at the UN.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Ethiopians have resisted because (a) such an initiative might result
                        in a call for a cease-fire before their military victories are secure; and
                        (b) might focus world attention on the rights of the Ogaden peoples for
                        self-determination.</p>
                    <p>(3) The Soviets are opposed because (a) they might have to veto a resolution
                        which calls for a peaceful resolution to the dispute and the withdrawal of
                        all foreign troops from the Ogaden (including Soviet and Cuban); and (b)
                        would inhibit the consolidation of their position in Ethiopia, which at
                        present is based upon their military commitment to help Ethiopia regain its
                        Ogaden territory by force of arms.</p>
                    <p>(4) The Somalis appear to be opposed because a UN Resolution might call for
                        the withdrawal of their troops from the Ogaden and the renunciation of
                        Somali claims to the territory.</p>

                    <p>At the President’s request, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1"
                            >Turner</persName> began the meeting with an intelligence briefing on
                        the military situation in the Horn.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Not
                            found.</note> [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] there is
                        no Ethiopian military activity in the southern Ogaden now. [<hi

                            rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] advance was slowed
                        in the last ten days, and the Somalis have executed a reasonably organized
                        withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> inquired why the Ethiopian advance had
                        slowed, and <hi rend="italic">Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1"
                                >Turner</persName>
                        </hi> replied that the Ethiopians had outrun their logistics and that the
                        Somalis were better organized than expected. The Admiral continued that the
                        main battle now is developing around Jijiga [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                            declassified</hi>]. He advised that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] we can expect a major push within a week to ten
                        days by the Ethiopian forces. Further, the Cubans will be deeply involved.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> said there was no
                        indication that the Somalis have yet made a decision to withdraw and that in
                        fact it was too late for them to withdraw and protect all their forces.
                        Thus, the key question becomes what they will lose in the battle at Jijiga.
                        If the Somalis fight to the death they may be able to withdraw 5,000 of the
                        20,000 men now deployed at Jijiga, <pb n="150" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_150"
                        />but without armor. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>
                        admitted that the chance of a successful defense of Jijiga is slim, as is
                        the chance of withdrawing more than a token force of Somali armor. After the
                        battle for Jijiga and withdrawal of Somali forces, the Somalis may try to
                        build on the present core of defense around Hargeisa, but they will be no
                        match for the Ethiopians if the latter are accompanied by Cubans. The
                        Intelligence Community believes that the Soviets will counsel restraint with
                        respect to crossing the border, but there will be great pressures on the
                        Ethiopian leadership to go into Somalia. Militarily, they may not want to be
                        in a position of facing a Somali army in front of them with Somalia forces
                        at their rear in the Ogaden or in southern Somalia.</p>

                        </hi> inquired about the credibility of clandestine reports that the

                        these reports, but that it is hard to tell what the Ethiopians will do if
                        the Somalis withdraw from the southern Ogaden.</p>

                        would be unwise not to have a plan to invade Somalia and proceed to

                        and the Cubans back and noted that the Intelligence Community believes that
                        the Soviets will pay that price.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> asked whether the Iranians and

                        would do in the Horn and has said he would send help if the border was

                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> asked whether there would be a shift in

                        the Ethiopians, particularly in view of US inaction. He noted that a Soviet
                        General is directing the Ethiopians in battle and that the Ethiopians were
                        even making progress in Eritrea.</p>

                        deploy the carrier and take credit for successfully preventing the invasion.
                        On the other hand, if we don’t <pb n="154" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_154"/>know
                        how the situation will come out, or we do not intend to use the aircraft or
                        the carrier in Somalia, then we should not put it in. There is a great
                        danger that our bluff will be called with serious implications for the

                        </hi> said that while he agreed on the advisability of using a carrier if in
                        fact the Ethiopians were likely to stop at the border, he was also concerned
                        about the larger consequences of such an invasion succeeding and overrunning
                        Somalia. This would be destabilizing for Saudi Arabia and Iran, and would
                        also affect our allies in Europe. He continued, “I am prepared to put in a
                        carrier to use against Cubans participating in an invasion of Somalia if
                        other countries in the region are also prepared to go in.” If the countries
                        in the region will not help, then we certainly should not put in the
                        carrier.</p>

                        is a risk we should not take.”</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> inquired where the aircraft carriers

                        >Vance</persName>’s above stated position, said he had no quarrel with the

                        expressed his concern about the consequences of the Soviet and Cuban role.
                        If we by deploying a carrier could deter the Ethiopians and Cubans from
                        invading, this would retrieve the situation.</p>

                        assurances, and the reality of a very serious situation in the Horn. He

                        respect to arms transfers, the memorandum should state “Should Somalia agree
                        to and announce a decision to withdraw from the Ogaden, the US would be
                        prepared to authorize action for third country transfers.” While this point

                            >Brzezinski</persName> said it should be noted in the minutes that the
                        President was prepared to authorize third country arms transfers if Ethiopia
                        invaded Somalia. He added that a second <pb n="158" facs="0193"
                            xml:id="pg_158"/>point to be made in the consultations would be “If they

                        interference with flights or ship movements bringing aid to Somalia. In such
                        an event, the US would respond.</p>

                        </hi> said he would express it somewhat differently, that the US should take
                        the position that if the Soviets take military action, we will interpose
                        ourselves.</p>

                        if the Soviets take military action we will have to stand by the countries

                        </hi> said that the Soviets were most likely to rely on diplomatic threats
                        to stop aid to Somalia.</p>

                        </hi> suggested that if the Soviets even do this, fundamental decisions will
                        be required of this government.</p>
                    <p>

                        </hi> said that the dividing line is in fact conflict between proxies and

                        a confrontation if the Soviets impose one.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        </hi> said his preference would be to let the situation ride without
                        volunteering to the countries of the region that we would react to the
                        Soviets.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>
                        </hi> disagreed, saying that the President wanted us to do something to make
                        clear to the Soviets, Cubans and Ethiopians what is being invited by their
                        action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        </hi> suggested that this would be an unavoidable question—that the regional
                        leaders have great anxieties about what the Soviets might do, and will
                        certainly ask what we will do. Our answer should be that if the Cubans
                        attack the regional countries they will have to counter it; if the Soviets
                        interfere, we stand by to counter them.</p>

                        </hi> said there was a danger of misunderstanding of this by our friends. He
                        said there is a very real chance that if Saudi <pb n="159" facs="0194"
                            xml:id="pg_159"/>Arabia and Iran get involved and get beaten, they will
                        say they thought we would help them against the Soviet threat.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        </hi> said he agreed that it is important to clarify this point, and that we
                        are not talking about indirect Soviet involvement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        </hi> suggested in this context that we say we would “offset” the Soviets.
                        This could include diplomatic means.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        </hi> said that he would check back with the Secretary of State and the
                        Secretary of Defense on the exact language being sent to the President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName>
                        </hi> said the commitment we are making is actually a modest one because all
                        of this will take place only if the Somalis withdraw from the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>
                        </hi> added that it would also have relevance in the event Somalia is
                        invaded.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName>
                        </hi> agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>,
                        but noted that this would not be mentioned in our consultations with
                        countries in the region. They will be told that our commitment to offset the
                        Soviets applies only if the Somalis withdraw.</p>

                        right, but that it is important to establish a record that we went to the
                        countries in the region and they declined to help. If they do not go in,
                        there will be no US involvement.</p>

                        </hi> suggested that we will have major problems with the Kenyans with
                        respect to third country arms transfers to Somalia. He advised that we be
                        very careful with the Kenyan delegation due in the United States in the near
                        future. He added that their concerns might be alleviated by noting that such
                        arms transfers would be “only for defensive forces within Somalia”.</p>

                        noted that the President favored some additional aid to Savimbi in Angola.
                        Also, we should stop telling other countries not to help Savimbi.</p>

                        He noted, however, to general agreement of the participants, that he would

                        the President wants a positive response. We would like to have a military

                        ceasefire? What happens to the Soviets and Cubans in this process? What

                        the position that he has no forces there. We will have a problem defining

                        we underline our impotence on the Horn. Our remedies are hollow.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I enclose with this memorandum the recommendations of Thursday’s <gloss
                            target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> regarding the African Horn.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d66fn2">Not attached, but see <ref target="#d65">Document
                                65</ref>.</note> In my judgment the recommendations do not go far
                        enough and they are not responsive to the real problem.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment, that problem is the Soviet insistence on defining detente in
                        a purely selective way, retaining for itself the right to use force in order
                        to promote wider political objectives. I do not believe that anyone serious
                        can accept the argument that the Soviet Union is in Ethiopia for the sake of
                        protecting Ethiopia’s frontiers; it is there because it has a larger design
                        in mind. To start thwarting that design, we have to increase the costs to
                        the Soviet Union of its engagement in Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>In the memorandum which follows, let me state as concisely as I can how I see
                        the Soviet motives; how I interpret the possible implications <pb n="178"
                            facs="0213" xml:id="pg_178"/>of Soviet/Cuban success; and what in my
                        judgment should be our response.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Motives</hi>. There are two possible
                        interpretations:</p>
                    <p>(1) Soviet leadership is divided. As a consequence, each bureaucracy does
                        “its own thing.” The diplomats and others are pursuing <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations; the secret police is
                        cracking down on dissidents; and the military-ideological sector exploits
                        any available opportunity to promote Soviet influence. I do not find this
                        interpretation persuasive because a decision of this magnitude, involving
                        such major possible consequences, is not likely to be undertaken simply on
                        the basis of a condition-reflex.</p>
                    <p>(2) The second interpretation is that the Soviet Union is pursuing
                        deliberately a policy on which it embarked some fifteen years ago: to
                        structure a relationship of stability with the United States in those areas
                        that are congenial or convenient to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, while pursuing assertively every opportunity for the
                        promotion of Soviet influence. In promoting that influence the Soviets are
                        becoming bolder. There is thus a striking contrast between the Angolan
                        operation—conducted entirely through proxies—and the Ethiopian affair—in
                        which the proxies still carry the major burden but the Soviet presence is
                        more self-evident (see the attached intercept).<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3"
                            >Not attached and not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>What is even more disturbing is that the Soviets apparently have concluded
                        that they can run such risks and get away with them. Brezhnev has simply
                        brushed aside your earlier and quite frank expression of concern (see
                        attached excerpts).<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">Not attached. For Brezhnev’s
                            letter to <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, see <ref

                        posture, to make noises, and then to do nothing.</p>
                    <p>I believe it is unwise, potentially very dangerous, to reinforce them in this
                        conclusion. This brings me logically to the discussion of the likely
                        consequences of the foregoing.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Implications</hi>. Three different sets of implications
                        should be considered.</p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Regional</hi>. Soviet success in Ethiopia, even if
                        limited to the defeat of the Somalis but not involving the penetration of
                        Somalia as such, will have a significant demonstration effect elsewhere in
                        Africa. It will encourage radical African states to act more assertively; it
                        will also free the Cubans, perhaps even with more overt Soviet support, to
                        become engaged in the struggle against Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p>Our position in the Somalian-Ethiopian conflict is ambivalent enough, because
                        of Somali aggressiveness. Our position regarding Rho<pb n="179" facs="0214"
                            xml:id="pg_179"/>desia would be even more difficult because any
                        opposition to Soviet/Cuban involvement will put us, de facto, on the side of
                        apartheid.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">International</hi>. I fear that the impact on Saudi
                        Arabia and Iran will be significant. It will not be felt immediately but it
                        will contribute to the gradual “finlandization” of their outlook. No one in
                        the region will fail to notice that the Soviet Union acted assertively,
                        energetically, and had its own way. This will have a significant effect on
                        Soviet neighbors; I do not think anyone here appreciates the degree to which
                        the neighbors of the Soviet Union are fearful of the Soviet Union and see
                        themselves as entirely dependent on American resolution.</p>
                    <p>I also do not believe that it is beating the drums of alarm to suggest that
                        in the longer run there will be a ripple-effect in Europe as well.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Domestic</hi>. It is only a question of time before the
                        right wing begins to argue that the above demonstrates our incompetence as
                        well as weakness. This will have a negative impact politically, and it will
                        also complicate any attempt at a reasonable negotiation with the Soviet
                        Union on matters of mutual importance, such as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>. Whether we like it or not, there is thus a linkage. To
                        pretend that it does not exist is simply to evade reality; moreover, the
                        Soviets do want <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and in some respects
                        they may need it even more than we. We can already see from their sensitive
                        reactions to any suggestion of linkage that they are concerned about this
                        aspect. However, the important point domestically is that it will strengthen
                        the right wing, and make the conduct of a reasonable and flexible foreign
                        policy more difficult.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Our Response</hi>. Our response should be comprehensive
                        and should fall into several categories.</p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Strategy for Political Settlement</hi>. I believe this
                        one has advanced the furthest and we do have a good four-point approach:</p>
                    <p>A. Somali withdrawal;</p>
                    <p>B. Some African presence in the Ogaden to prevent retribution as the
                        Ethiopians return;</p>
                    <p>C. Soviet-Cuban withdrawal;</p>
                    <p>D. No further arming of Somalia.</p>
                    <p>The above is likely to be appealing to some African countries and we already
                        have obtained the support of Kenya. We are now working on Nigeria. The above
                        will require, however, considerable pressure on the Somalis to withdraw and
                        greater assurance to the Somalis that, if they withdraw, they will not
                        become vulnerable. (This is where American assurances and even physical
                        presence become pertinent, as per #5 below).</p>
                    <p>We are now in the process of developing more specific proposals regarding the
                        modalities of Somali withdrawal, regarding a ceasefire arrangement during
                        such withdrawal, and post-withdrawal provisions.</p>
                    <pb n="180" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_180"/>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Measures to Convey to the Soviet Union U.S.
                            Concern</hi>. We have been quite weak in this regard and so far
                        essentially passive. I think we should consider suspending a number of
                        bilateral programs, starting with space. <persName corresp="#p_PF_1">Frank
                            Press</persName> has identified transportation and housing as areas in
                        which either not much is happening or as areas in which the Soviets are the
                        greater beneficiaries.</p>
                    <p>We should also continue to reiterate the point that we are not imposing
                        linkages but the Soviets are creating them, including <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The Soviets have already shown
                        sensitivity to this argument, and we should not back down.</p>
                    <p>However, the area of greatest Soviet sensitivity is China. We have neglected
                        this dimension entirely. Developing more cooperation with the Chinese in
                        science and technology will be a useful opener (and we should encourage—not
                        discourage—West European arms sales to China). We also need to develop
                        deliberately political consultations and perhaps even cooperation. The
                        Chinese are worried about the Middle East and the African Horn, and they
                        could even help us more directly (for example, they do have a direct
                        relationship with Mugabe). In any case, the Soviets are willing to operate
                        on several levels in their dealings with us; we should not be unduly
                        sensitive to Soviet concerns and similarly operate on several levels towards
                        them.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I think it would be useful to engage in direct high-level talks
                        with the Soviet Union in which your emissaries would talk both
                        constructively and toughly about their African adventures and their
                        implications for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, etc. If the Soviets
                        do not conclude that we are prepared to stand up to them, you can only
                        anticipate worsening difficulties in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Measures to Convey U.S. Concern to Cuba</hi>. I have
                        proposed at the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> more direct assistance
                        to Savimbi in Angola. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy</persName> has asked
                        for more systematic examination of the specific proposals, and we will be
                        taking this issue up again in the next <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                        meeting. I believe we ought to try to enhance the cost to the Cubans of
                        their involvement anywhere in Africa.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I am developing now proposals designed to put greater pressure
                        on Cuba in the various non-aligned bodies with which Cuba is associated.
                        Non-aligned countries ought to be sensitized to the fact that Cuba fights
                        Soviet wars of intervention.</p>
                    <p>In addition, some of our trilateral friends are lending money to Cuba. Given
                        Cuba’s role, I feel we ought to approach them and ask them to desist from
                        what is tantamount to economic aid to Cuba.</p>
                    <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Relations with Ethiopia</hi>. Here I believe we are now
                        on the right course. We will try to maintain a relationship with <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>, warn him whenever possible of
                        the dangers of his becoming excessively <pb n="181" facs="0216"
                            xml:id="pg_181"/>dependent on the Soviets, and we should in addition
                        take advantage of such neutrals as <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1"
                            >Tito</persName> and Desai to encourage <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> to terminate, as soon as possible, his dependence
                        on the Soviets and Cubans.</p>
                    <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Military Posture</hi>. We have provided assurances to
                        concerned countries that we will not permit the Soviets to interfere with
                        their aid to Somalia. However, do we have the capability to deliver on this
                        promise? I doubt it.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, if Somalia is to withdraw, it has to have a higher sense of
                        assurance that such a withdrawal will not be followed either by invasion or
                        by some internal disruption. Our military presence in the area would provide
                        such assurance. Such military presence is also preferable to further arms
                        supplies to Somalia, because these frighten our friends, the Kenyans. In
                        fact, a proximate U.S. naval presence, especially an aircraft carrier, would
                        have a pacifying effect on the Kenyans, provide reassurance to the
                        Somalians, and some deterrent to the Soviets and the Cubans in Ethiopia. If
                        they do not cross the frontier, we could later assert that it was thanks to
                        our presence and resolution. We should move the carrier into place and
                        announce that it is there to guarantee that the war does not spread after
                        the Somali withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>A final point: The Soviets must be made to realize that detente, to be
                        enduring, has to be both comprehensive and reciprocal. If the Soviets are
                        allowed to feel that they can use military force in one part of the
                        world—and yet maintain cooperative relations in other areas—then they have
                        no incentive to exercise self-restraint. The conclusion to be drawn may be
                        unpleasant and difficult, but I see no other alternative: in brief, our
                        limited actions in regard to the specific conflict must be designed to
                        convey our determination, while our broader response must be designed to
                        make the Soviets weigh to a greater extent the consequences of their
                        assertiveness for detente as a whole.</p>

                        the following assessment of the possible impact in the near term on the
                        attitudes and actions of the principal countries or regional groupings of
                        countries concerned with the Ethiopia/Somalia situation is submitted:</p>
                    <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Saudi Arabia:</hi> The Saudis have expressed the
                        greatest concern with the trend of events. They are the single nation that
                        appears to be willing to continue substantial support to Somalia without a
                        clear US commitment to do so also. Their concern is founded in a basic fear
                        of the radicalization of the Arab world which would endanger their monarchy
                        and in an historic concern with Russian aspirations in the Middle East. [<hi
                            rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>A. [<hi rend="italic">12 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>B. [<hi rend="italic">5 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>C. [<hi rend="italic">14 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Arab Confrontation States with Israel:</hi> Egypt alone
                        feels threatened from a Soviet position in the Horn, through the possible
                        impact on Sudan and the southern access to the Red Sea. In recent weeks,
                        however, the Egyptian position has become much less resolute in supporting
                        Somalia in the absence of a clear US commitment and in view of military
                        developments on the ground. The Egyptian government has little opportunity
                        to distance itself from the US, however. Jordan expresses general concern
                        with US inaction, although the Horn issue does not bulk large there; Lebanon
                        is too preoccupied to be concerned; and Syria is still adjusting its
                        policies to the change of Soviet relationships in the Horn—the Syrians have
                        not yet swung around to support Ethiopia. The reinforcement of the Soviet
                        position in the Horn is unlikely to alter the positions of any of these
                        States any time soon.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Iran:</hi> The Shah’s public warning that Iran
                        supported the territorial integrity of Somalia has been eroded in recent
                        weeks by the lack of US commitment. Iran probably feels too exposed in its
                        contiguous location to challenge the Soviets without firm US backing. At the
                        same time, it is clear that the Shah has never intended to be dependent on
                            <pb n="183" facs="0218" xml:id="pg_183"/>US support in the long run and
                        hence it is unlikely that the US position in this Horn of Africa issue will
                        alter his policies.</p>
                    <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union:</hi> In embarking late last year on
                        greatly expanded support for Ethiopia, the Soviets probably estimated the
                        military risks as negligible and the political costs as modest and
                        manageable. They have probably not substantially revised this estimate. They
                        have seen signs of US concern mount in recent weeks, but probably perceive
                        it as lacking focus, expressing frustration more than a determination to
                        act. They see the US as divided on the extent to which pressures should be
                        brought to bear on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> outside the
                        Horn. They probably believe the US has for several weeks accepted a
                        Soviet/Cuban backed Ethiopian victory as a <hi rend="italic">fait
                            accompli</hi> and that Washington now regards a possible invasion of
                        Somalia as a watershed event. They are almost certainly persuaded the US
                        will not take action itself or mobilize others to act locally if there is no
                        invasion of Somalia, and even if there is an invasion, they probably doubt
                        that the US could put together a countervailing effort in timely
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets probably prefer an outcome which does not include such an
                        invasion, believing that without accepting any additional risks they will
                        have already succeeded in achieving their local objectives and in reviving
                        the credibility of their capacity to act as a global power in distant areas.
                        Should large-scale fighting be ended in the next few weeks without an
                        invasion of Somalia, the Soviet leaders probably think it most likely that
                        there will be no serious further consequences for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> or other major aspects of the bilateral relationship. They
                        will continue, however, to watch carefully the impact of their Horn behavior
                        on the public and Congress and on the correlation of forces inside the US
                        government, which they see as now engaged in internal debate about US-Soviet
                        relations. Meanwhile, they will look upon their Ethiopian achievement as
                        advertising to revolutionary forces in southern Africa their readiness and
                        capability to act, and as providing a springboard from which to seize other
                        opportunities to expand their role in armed struggles should they
                        appear.</p>
                    <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Ethiopia’s Neighbors:</hi> Kenya is driven by its
                        concern about a Somali invasion, though there is clearly an underlying
                        concern at a continuing Soviet presence next door.</p>
                    <p>Sudan’s opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>,
                        expressed in material support for the Eritrean rebels and expressions of
                        intent to support Somalia, has cooled in recent weeks; <persName
                            corresp="#p_NG_1">Nimeiry</persName> has reestablished contact with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>. Having found it
                        necessary in July 1975 to reduce the Soviet presence in Khartoum, Sudan
                        clearly must be apprehensive at the sizeable Soviet presence next door, but
                        is accommodating to the power realities.</p>
                    <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Southern African States:</hi> Very little is heard from
                        these states that would indicate that events in the Horn will influence
                        their policies. <pb n="184" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_184"/>The Soviets,
                        however, have reinforced the example of Angola in demonstrating their
                        readiness and ability to provide effective military support to revolutionary
                        movements.</p>

                            has failed—but, like Hitler, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> realizes that Somalia has
                        almost no chance of halting the Ethiopian offensive. In his view, however,
                        he must be seen to yield only in the face of an overwhelming force of
                        Ethiopians, Cubans, and Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName>’s strategy has thus been to stand and fight. This does
                        not mean that he would allow the Somali army to be destroyed in the Ogaden.
                        He might at some point order a withdrawal, but only when he can justify it
                        as necessary on military grounds.</p>
                    <p>The serious Somali reverses at Jijiga over the weekend may make moot any
                        option of a voluntary Somali withdrawal from the northern <pb n="185"

                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> soon to decide what to do with his
                        forces in the south. He is unlikely to unilaterally withdraw his forces in
                        order to improve Somalia’s legal and political position before international
                        opinion. For <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> to pull his forces
                        out of the Ogaden simply to remove the stigma of aggression from Somalia
                        would be viewed by his governing colleagues and his countrymen as a betrayal
                        of the Ogadeni Somalis and would give <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName>’s potential domestic opponents a strong weapon to use
                        against him.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> ordered a unilateral
                        withdrawal, he would also be vulnerable to charges of tacitly admitting that
                        Somalia had no right to pursue its irredentist claims—an admission no Somali
                        leader can afford to make. The Somalis will be unwilling to renounce
                        permanently the “Greater Somalia” concept or to make a formal commitment not
                        to sponsor future military operations in the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>Fear of domestic political repercussions is therefore likely to prevent
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> from ordering a voluntary
                        withdrawal of Somali forces from the Ogaden. To overcome these fears even
                        partially, and thus make a voluntary pull back possible—but still not
                            certain—<persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> would have to
                        receive assurances on some major points. At a minimum he would demand
                        guarantees, supported by international agreements, of no reprisals against
                        the Ogadeni Somalis. He would also demand—in return for Somali
                        withdrawal—the withdrawal of Ethiopian, Cuban, and Soviet forces from the
                        Ogaden, although he might be satisfied with an ultimate withdrawal rather
                        than an immediate one.</p>
                    <p>Although he would not demand assurances of substantial foreign military
                        support to resupply the Somali army, an offer to do this would be an
                        inducement, since <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> could then
                        present it to his domestic audience as evidence that Somalia would be able
                        to fight another day. He would probably make this argument, at least
                        privately, even if potential foreign donors stipulated that their assistance
                        could be used for defensive purposes only.</p>

                        Addis Ababa 1025.</p>
                    <p>1. French <gloss target="#t_MilAtt_1">MilAtt</gloss> was informed March 5 by
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_MilAtt_1">MilAtt</gloss> that Jijiga had been
                        recaptured that morning. Soviet also confirmed that Kara Mara Pass had
                        fallen to Ethiopians. French <gloss target="#t_MilAtt_1">MilAtt</gloss>
                        believed that major thrust toward Jijiga was from NNW and was combined
                        Ethiopian-Cuban operation. French <gloss target="#t_MilAtt_1">MilAtt</gloss>
                        further stated that Ethiopians took heavy casualties. (This was reflected in
                        original Ethiopian announcement of capture of Jijiga calling on broad masses
                        to be prepared for further recruitment of militia and donations and
                        contributions of blood and revolutionary equipment.) French <gloss
                            target="#t_MilAtt_1">MilAtt</gloss> personally thought Ethiopians would
                        not cross Somali frontier and would turn south toward Gode. He also believed
                        reopening of railroad would be priority military objective.</p>
                    <p>2. Comment: Atmosphere in Addis is one of euphoria following most significant
                        Ethiopian victory in Ogaden since beginning of war. With Jijiga recaptured,
                        it will be particularly significant to note in which direction Ethiopians
                        press their current advantage, especially in light of public assurances that
                        they do not intend to cross Somalia’s frontier. Large public rally had been
                        previously scheduled for March 8 in Addis Ababa to commemorate International
                        Women’s Day. Dirg Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        had also planned to deliver speech at rally. Undoubtedly, he will use
                        occasion to extol Ethiopian victory at Jijiga.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Please seek an immediate appointment with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> to convey to him the following
                        points:</p>
                    <p>1. The United States and Somalia share certain basic objectives concerning
                        the situation in the Horn. It is imperative that we work together to achieve
                        a peaceful resolution of the conflict. We understand your sympathy for the
                        people of the Ogaden and their strong desire for self-determination.
                        However, we believe that this goal cannot be achieved through the use of
                        force. We share your view on the importance of reducing Soviet influence in
                        the region. An Ethiopian/Cuban/Soviet victory in the Ogaden fighting could
                        entrench them in the Horn of Africa. However, we believe such an outcome can
                        only be avoided through a negotiated settlement.</p>
                    <p>2. In the past we have outlined principles which we believed took
                        sufficiently into account the interests of all parties as to be an
                        acceptable basis on which to build a negotiated settlement. These principles
                        called for a Somali withdrawal from the Ogaden, the concurrent withdrawal of
                        all foreign combat forces, the placing of neutral observers in the Ogaden
                        during withdrawal to ensure no reprisals are taken against the inhabitants,
                        and a commitment to begin discussions with regard to the political future of
                        the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States still subscribes to these principles as the best
                        foundation for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. We believe that they
                        are in the interest of Somalia. However, it is clear to the United States
                        that the longer Somalia refuses to accept them as a basis for negotiation,
                        the more difficult it will be for Somalia’s friends to exert their influence
                        on other nations to negotiate on the basis of these principles.</p>
                    <p>4. The best intelligence available to the American Government indicates that
                        the Somali military position in the Ogaden is gravely imperiled in the face
                        of the current Ethiopian offensive. Somali troops now face Ethiopian forces
                        bolstered by well-trained Cuban combat <pb n="188" facs="0223"
                            xml:id="pg_188"/>troops of division strength aided by substantial Soviet
                        logistical support and Cuban and Ethiopian air support of considerable
                        magnitude. It is our assessment that the Somali troops cannot survive this
                        offensive without unacceptable losses of men and materiel. It is also our
                        view that Somalia’s military defeat could force it to negotiate on the basis
                        of principles which are totally detrimental to its interests.</p>
                    <p>5. The President believes that the only way to achieve your objectives and
                        the only way to enlist the active diplomatic support of the United States
                        and other friendly nations in the region is to announce and implement a
                        withdrawal of Somali forces from the Ogaden. This must be done in the very
                        near future if you are to avoid a destruction of your forces and a possible
                        invasion of your homeland. You may say publicly that your announcement was
                        in response to a personal appeal from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> to take action to bring the human suffering to an end
                        now when we appear to be engaged in a new round of violence of a scale
                        unprecedented in the Horn of Africa involving active participation by
                        outside powers.</p>
                    <p>6. With Somalia’s agreement to withdraw, the United States is prepared to
                        initiate a broad diplomatic initiative in support of the above principles
                        designed to marshal the force of world opinion in deterrence of an
                        Ethiopian/Cuban invasion of Somalia.</p>
                    <p>7. Once you have taken the necessary steps to implement your withdrawal, the
                        President will commence consultations with the Congress to seek authority to
                        provide Somalia with some defensive weapons and discuss with other nations
                        the possibility of their also supplying such weapons. You may state publicly
                        that the President is also willing to ask the Congress for additional
                        economic assistance to Somalia under such circumstances. You may also state
                        that the US has indicated that it is prepared to contribute to efforts which
                        might be organized to bring about the recovery of the war-ravaged areas of
                        the Ogaden. But we must repeat that US assistance to Somalia will only be
                        forthcoming after you have publicly announced your intention to withdraw
                        Somali troops from the Ogaden and they have returned to the Somali side of
                        its internationally-recognized frontiers.</p>
                    <p>8. You should be under no illusion that if you do not take the necessary
                        steps to withdraw your forces from the Ogaden, the United States will come
                        to your assistance if you are invaded. As long as Somalia’s forces remain in
                        Ethiopia, American law prohibits the provision of aid to Somalia, even if
                        Somali territory were invaded.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">In telegram 458

                        judgment that the Somali forces in the Ogaden face the prospect of imminent

                        withdrawal, holding out the prospect of humanitarian aid to people of the
                        Ogaden, development assistance for Somalia, and defensive military
                        assistance if he does so. It also promises our diplomatic support for a
                        negotiated settlement, including the placement of international observers in

                        withdraw his forces, U.S. law prohibits our coming to his assistance even if

                    <p>1. The Western Ambassadors were called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at
                        1400Z this afternoon, March 9, where the following statement was read by
                        Director General Mohamed Sharif: Begin text. The Government of the Somali
                        Democratic Republic (<gloss target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss>) would like to
                        communicate to you the latest developments in the Horn of Africa. There has
                        been fierce fighting between the western Somali liberation fronts on the one
                        hand and the Ethiopians and the unholy alliance of the Soviet Union and its
                        foreign allies on the other. The international community has been following
                        with growing dismay the massive deployment of destructive and sophisticated
                        weapons. Friendly countries have proposed on many occasions the withdrawal
                        of our (<gloss target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss>) units in order to create an
                        atmosphere conducive to a negotiated settlement. The <gloss
                            target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss> has decided to effect such a withdrawal.
                        Friendly countries are requested to exert all diplomatic influence in order
                        to realize the following:</p>
                    <p>(1) Withdrawal of all foreign troops,</p>
                    <p>(2) A cease fire,</p>
                    <p>(3) Negotations for a settlement on the basis of self determination,</p>
                    <p>(4) Placement of observers to ensure the avoidance of genocide or reprisals
                        against the Somali people living in the area.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss> hopes that all friendly countries
                        will exert the necessary influence toward finding a just negotiated
                        settlement of the problem. End of text.</p>
                    <p>2. Questioned on the timing of the withdrawal, Sharif said the orders have
                        been issued and it is now taking place. He added that Somali troops were not
                        now engaging in combat. The Director General <pb n="191" facs="0226"
                            xml:id="pg_191"/>said the announcement had not been made public, but was
                        being communicated first to the American, British, French, Italian and West
                        German Ambassadors since their countries had urged withdrawal of Somali
                        forces. He said other chiefs of friendly missions would be informed
                        immediately, but he could not say when a public statement would be made. In
                        the interim, he requested the information be treated as confidential.</p>
                    <p>3. Comment: We cannot believe the <gloss target="#t_GSDR_1">GSDR</gloss> will
                        delay the public announcement much longer. With all friendly mission chiefs
                        informed, the word is bound to leak within hours if it has not done so
                            already.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">

                        <hi rend="italic">SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Discussion focussed around three principal topics:</p>
                    <p>• Problems relating to the ongoing conflict and the Somali withdrawal</p>
                    <p>• Measures to reinforce regional security, stability and self-confidence</p>
                    <p>• Measures and initiatives vis-a-vis the Soviets and Cubans</p>
                    <p>The following decisions relating to current matters were taken:</p>
                    <p>• SR–71 missions will be flown only with permission of the British, and the
                        Somalis and Ethiopians in respect to their own territory, and State will
                        secure the necessary authorizations. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1"
                            >Turner</persName> pointed out that as of now SR–71 missions cannot be
                        justified on the basis of intelligence need. The group recognized this fact
                        but felt that SR–71 flights could be politically advantageous and both
                        Ethiopia and Somalia could be offered briefings on the status of the
                        withdrawal/ceasefire from information derived from them.</p>
                    <p>• Everyone agreed that we should encourage the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                            >OAU</gloss> to take initiative in respect to ceasefire arrangements,
                        observers, measures to protect the civil population and related matters and
                        that we should stay in close contact with the Nigerians and Gabonese. In
                        respect to UN initiatives, it was agreed that this would be desirable but
                        that it would be unlikely to succeed unless it could be done at <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> request or with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                            >OAU</gloss> concurrence.</p>
                    <p>• The President’s 9 March statement, it was noted, conditions future economic
                        and military aid on a Somali commitment to respect its neighbors’
                        territorial integrity.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">For the text of <persName

                        felt that this condition should not be applied to a <gloss
                            target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> agreement about to be signed but that
                        any further economic aid should be reviewed in the light of this condition.
                        The idea of providing economic aid to facilitate rehabilitation to be
                        administered by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> was advanced and
                        will be further investigated.</p>
                    <p>• The group saw too many potential pitfalls in a <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> visit to Washington but felt that a special emissary to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, who could also visit some
                        of the other capitals in the area, would be a very good idea, and a more
                        specific plan will be developed.</p>
                    <pb n="193" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_193"/>
                    <p>• The idea of a regional conference was discussed at length. It was felt that
                        it would have to be very carefully put together to bring in Africans and not
                        appear hostile to the Ethiopians. The idea will be examined further in
                        connection with the special emissary’s mission.</p>
                    <p>• The group agreed that more briefings and consultation with the Congress was
                        desirable. It will be done soon.</p>
                    <p>• Everyone felt it was too early to consider a port call in Somalia.</p>
                    <p>Discussion of measures that could be taken to demonstrate to the Soviets that
                        there is a price to pay for their intervention in Ethiopia brought out one
                        new idea: the possibility of tightening port security regulations as a
                        retaliatory measure against Soviet shipping; but the group tended to feel
                        that no new actions should be taken until Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> took serious soundings with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> on several
                        immediate issues:</p>
                    <p>• Soviet support for a ceasefire and a neutral observer group.</p>
                    <p>• Halt to inflow of Soviet and Cuban combat personnel.</p>
                    <p>• Suggestion that Soviets urge Cubans to begin planning withdrawal of combat
                        presence from Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>• Warning to Soviets against redeployment of Cubans against Eritreans because
                        of the unsettling effect this would have on the Sudanese and other Muslim
                        supporters of the Eritrean insurgency.</p>
                    <p>• Urge Soviets to take other measures and gestures to reduce tension in the
                        area and promote settlement; also urge them to press <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> to do the same.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> will talk to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> as soon as possible on
                        these matters.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> on March 11 to discuss the
                            Horn of Africa. See <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d89">

                    </p>
                    <p>In respect to Cuba, the group felt that the possibility of bringing pressure
                        by limiting economic credits which Cuba is seeking from a great many Western
                        countries should be further examined. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        will do a study. Since the analysis of questions relating to the possibility
                        of support for Savimbi was not completed, this question was deferred to the
                        next <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> Horn meeting.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that we should prod <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> on <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi> for our

                        thank-you letter for his visit and bring up the issue in it.</p>
                    <p>The group was informed of the President’s desire to have the Eritrean problem
                        thoroughly examined. Everyone agreed that this was now likely to become a
                        key issue because of its implications for Ethiopian-Sudanese relations and
                        the interest of key Muslim countries in <pb n="194" facs="0229"

                        produced a consensus that we should make a further effort to develop a
                        defensive military support relationship with <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> but that the letter <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> had given to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                            >Moose</persName> was not an adequate guarantee of Somalia’s acceptance
                        of limitations on use of military aid that might be provided. (The <gloss
                            target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> representative dissented from this
                        consensus, advocating that we restrict our support of Somalia to
                        humanitarian and economic assistance.) Secretary <persName

                            >JCS</gloss> representatives expressed certain cautions which the group
                        endorsed:</p>
                    <p>• We will have to be cautious about offering the Somalis items that would
                        have to be drawn from active units of our own forces or which are already
                        committed to other countries.</p>
                    <p>• We should be cautious about offering items that have a long production
                        lead-time. We will have to emphasize the production lead-time factor where
                        it is applicable so that the Somalis do not get the impression immediate
                        deliveries will be made.</p>
                    <p>• Some items that we are also going to be providing to Kenya should be
                        delivered to Kenya before any deliveries to Somalia take place.</p>
                    <p>• We can be concrete about the 45-day package but we will not discuss
                        specifics until we have a letter of commitment. Progress on a larger program
                        will require a survey and minimally acceptable U.S. military presence.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Eritrea:</p>
                    <p>There was a general feeling that we should not be very active on this issue
                        and a consensus that it would not be desirable to become involved in
                        supporting the rebellion ourselves. It was agreed that the United States
                        Government should take a <hi rend="italic">public stand in favor of a
                            negotiated solution</hi> and that we should continue to speak out
                        against Soviet and Cuban support of an Ethiopian military solution. There
                        was some variation of view among principals on the degree to which the
                        United States should encourage the Saudis and others to continue or increase
                        support for the insurgents. It was agreed that these options should be laid
                        before the President.<note n="5" xml:id="d76fn5">See <ref target="#d78"

                    <p>Following up on your idea that the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> could
                        be used to exert pressure on <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>,
                        I have done some quick preliminary analysis and have concluded that we
                        should pursue this. While <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> has a limited
                        role in developing this option, I recommend that you discuss it with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> at the earliest
                        opportunity. The schedule of <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> meetings
                        dictate rapid consideration on our part.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Objectives</p>
                    <p>We want to make it difficult for <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> to expand his military involvement in Africa. While
                        more precise objectives—deterrence of Cuban involvement in Eritrea or
                        invasion of Somalia—might be desirable, we will miss opportunities if we
                        focus too sharply on the specific situation which exists today. It is also
                        clear that direct means, like military or covert action or economic
                        sanctions, which are necessary for achieving a specific objective, are not
                        viable options domestically. We have been through them on several occasions
                        to no avail. (A summary of all the options that have been considered is
                            attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        We have neither the public support nor the political consensus to engage in
                        such major actions. We must therefore look to the more general objective of
                        lowering <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s propensity for
                        military involvement. One possible way of doing so is to try to make Soviet
                        support of Cuban overseas military involvement conflict with <persName
                            corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s aspirations to leadership of the
                        third world.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">What <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>
                        Wants</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> clearly wants to establish
                        himself as a third world leader. His involvement in wars of national
                        liberation, his heavy commitment of personnel to his African programs, his
                        rhetoric as defender of third world countries against imperialism, his
                        virulent anti-U.S. campaign, and his diplomatic efforts to woo third world
                        countries bear witness to his ambition. While he knows Soviet support in
                        Africa is vital to his success he is very sensitive to the criticism that he
                        is a Soviet stooge. These charges threaten his third world credentials. He
                        must appear to be operating outside of the Soviet orbit.</p>
                    <p>Thus far criticism of Cuba’s role as a Soviet surrogate has been muted, in
                        part because of the causes that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> has supported. Little criticism has come from third
                        world countries and these have been largely ineffective. The <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> will not condemn Cuba so long as the
                        territorial integrity of member states is not threatened. The Arab League,
                        while recently denouncing Cuban military involvement in Ethopia, was only
                        able to do so after its more radical members boycotted the meeting. U.S.
                        charges of late have been very mild and have had little impact. In the
                        absence of strong third world criticism, <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> has concluded, and will continue to conclude, that
                        military involvement in Africa, far from jeopardizing his drive for
                        leadership of the third world, has actually enhanced his position.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> has been silent. However, there are
                        rumblings of dissatisfaction within the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                        >NAM</gloss>; this undercurrent may form a basis for a real setback for
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Preparations have begun for the 1979 <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>
                        Summit Meeting. The Non-Aligned Coordinating Committee (NACC) will meet in
                        Kabul, Afghanistan, 6–10 May 1978, to develop a preliminary agenda. The
                        foreign ministers will convene 25–29 July 1978 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and
                        the Summit Meeting is scheduled for some time in 1979 (traditionally August)
                        in Havana, Cuba. The Cubans are putting great effort into this meeting.</p>
                    <p>In recent discussions between Afghan President Daoud and Yugoslavia’s
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName> an important segment dealt
                        with Cuba’s overseas military role and the need to see that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> remains truly non-aligned. The two leaders
                        are bothered by Cuban behavior. <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1"
                        >Tito</persName>, who has historically enjoyed a strong position in the
                            <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>, is particularly concerned. He may
                        also be concerned that his own leadership role in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> may be jeopardized by Cuban strength.
                        Nevertheless he knows that a viable non-aligned movement requires more
                        internal unity than exists today and surfacing the Cuban problem would not
                        help in this regard. He is thus in a quandary. He must promote unity; he
                        needs to deal with <pb n="203" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_203"/>the potentially
                        divisive issue of Cuban credentials. Other <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                            >NAM</gloss> members are aware that the issue of Cuba’s credentials will
                        have to be either addressed or deftly swept under the rug. The Afghans seem
                        to be leaning toward the latter. Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah departed
                        24 March for a three-week visit to a number of <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                            >NAM</gloss> member capitals. Apparently he is trying to ensure a NACC
                        meeting free of confrontation. Cuba’s role in the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                            >NAM</gloss> is one of the issues he would like to settle before the
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>We would like to see the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> address the
                        issue and Cuba’s credentials as a non-aligned state be brought under
                        concerted attack. Indeed failure to address this issue would be a setback
                        for us. <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> would likely take such
                        failure as an implied endorsement of his military involvement in Africa.
                        Since Cuba hosts the 1979 Summit and the host exercises control over both
                        procedure and substance, <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> will
                        probably be able to turn the meeting to his favor.</p>
                    <p>We do not know whether the current concern within the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> over Cuba’s role is sufficiently strong to
                        achieve what we want. We are also not sure that U.S. involvement in the
                        issue will help our cause or be counterproductive. These points will have to
                        be addressed by State in consultation with our embassies abroad. We do
                        believe, however, that what happens at the 1979 <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                            >NAM</gloss> Summit and its preparatory meeting can have a significant
                        impact on <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s future plans in
                        Africa. This issue is also one we have a strong common interest with the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Their relations with Havana are
                        virtually non-existent and they have attacked Cuban intervention in Africa.
                        There may be an opportunity for common action with China.</p>

                        equipment may form an important component of the non-lethal package. We will
                        also tell <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> that we will not

                        friendly countries disposed to help. Care will be taken to supply the

                        general-purpose military survey team which might generate extensive Somali
                        expectations and requests, it was decided that a survey group should confine
                        itself to areas in which we would be likely to supply material, such as the
                        communications field.</p>

                        violence and foreign military involvement. Let any foreign assistance to

                        implementation of these instructions the group agreed on the following
                        actions:</p>
                    <p>• Ambassadorial demarches in capitals of countries significant in the
                        non-aligned movement pointing out the fact that all-out Cuban support for a
                        military solution in Eritrea is contrary to non-aligned principles.</p>
                    <p>• Consultation with the Yugoslavs, Algerians, Indians, Indonesians and
                        Libyans on Eritrea with an aim to bringing pressure on the Cubans to desist
                        from involvement (as inconsistent with their status in the non-aligned
                        movement) and perhaps to develop a mediation effort to promote a negotiated
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>• Periodic statements by U.S. government spokesmen expressing concern for
                        continued bloodshed in Eritrea and hope that Africans might exert themselves
                        to bring about a negotiated solution.</p>
                    <p>• Consultation with the Egyptians, Saudis and Sudanese on their support for
                        the Eritrean insurgents and their perceptions of how negotiations can be
                            encouraged.<note n="4" xml:id="d79fn4">

                    <p>What appears to be a downturn in our relations with the Ethiopian government
                        was discussed briefly. The group agreed with the Secretary of State’s view
                        that for the immediate future we should avoid aggravating actions deriving
                        from human rights complaints and compensation for nationalized property so
                        as to keep open the possibility of an aid program and acceptance of an
                        ambassador. The Chairman suggested that covert efforts might be made to
                        encourage <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> to worry about
                        Soviet support for rivals. It was agreed that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"

                    <p>1. It appears now that <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has been
                        successful in countering the attempted coup against him this morning. The
                        attempt seems to have been started by some low-ranking officers at a camp
                        north of the city. They attempted to seize control of key points in
                        Mogadiscio but were routed by forces loyal to <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName>. Embassy observer reports it is now quiet west of
                        Mogadiscio on the Afgoi road where earlier there was fighting and a number
                        of casualties.</p>
                    <p>2. Egyptian military attache just returned (0800Z) from a circuit of the
                        military camps and Ministry of Defense hqtrs north of the city and reported
                        remnants of the mutinous units are now being mopped up by loyal forces.
                        Halim also told us he saw the Soviet Ambassador this morning coming from a
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> and looking very

                    <p>3. Presidential aide Omar Salim phoned DCM at 0830Z and said President
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> was in firm control of the

                        provided the catalyst for the abortive coup attempt of 9 April<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d81fn2">See <ref target="#d80">Document 80</ref>.</note> when he
                        ordered the arrest and execution of a large number of officers who fought in
                        the Ogaden campaign. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> was
                        apparently attempting to head off potential troublemaking by officers
                        embittered over the Somali army’s defeat in the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>The purges began in earnest shortly after the withdrawal of Somali regulars
                        from the Ogaden in early March, and reportedly involved officers primarily
                        from clans in northern and central Somalia. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> had long viewed these clans as contentious, disloyal
                        elements. The clans, for their part, had for years bitterly resented the
                        domination of Somali affairs by <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                        >Siad</persName>’s own clan—the Marehans.</p>
                    <p>Many of the officers targeted for elimination by <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> were said to have been convinced that the Somali
                        president used troops under their command as cannon fodder in the Ogaden
                        while deliberately keeping officers from his own clan out of dangerous
                        combat zones. The leaders of the 9 April coup, the most important of whom
                        were field grade officers and veteran Ogaden troop commanders, came from
                        these very same clan elements; they were motivated at least as much by
                        long-standing ethnic animosities toward <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> as by disenchantment with <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> in the aftermath of the Ogaden debacle, although they

                            >Siad</persName> feeling. There is no evidence that Soviets or
                        pro-Soviet Somali elements were involved in this coup attempt, but the logic
                        of the situation, as well as open Cuban broadcasts, argues that the Soviets
                        and Cubans are working to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"

                    <p>The coup collapsed quickly; it was ill-organized, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> apparently had advance knowledge of
                        it which permitted him to move against the instigators and thereby force
                        them to show their hand prematurely. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

                        revolt—which on the dissident side may have involved as many as 10–12
                        officers, 2000 troops, and 65 tanks—in less than 24 hours, although
                        mopping-up operations continued for some time thereafter.</p>
                    <p>There have been no major disturbances in the Mogadiscio area since the

                            >Siad</persName> has taken a number of steps to strengthen the

                        political enemies in the Somali government and security apparatus who,
                        largely because they belong to the same clan elements that instigated the
                        coup, are being accused of sympathizing with its objectives.</p>
                    <p>On balance, however, the Somali leader is conducting his post-coup
                        inquisition at a carefully measured pace, apparently out of fear that mass
                        arrests and heavy-handed treatment of suspects might spark a major outbreak
                        of clan warfare. Indeed, there have been reports of a series of disturbances
                        in north-central Somalia in recent weeks that on the surface largely involve
                        banditry, isolated shootings, and general unrest, but may stem from ethnic
                        rivalries.</p>

                        signals to the regional states. It was agreed to proceed with the survey

                        noted that the list of non-aligned states which are prepared to take a
                        strong position on the Cuban issue is not encouraging. It was decided to
                        target 10–12 countries where an approach could be most beneficial in
                        bringing pressure on Cuba. State would prepare this list with inputs from
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the U.S. Mission at the UN.</p>

                    <p>The need to be responsive to Sudan’s economic plight was recognized; however,
                        all agreed that there was little the U.S. could do until the Sudan qualifies
                        for an <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> loan, which means devaluation.
                        In view of the importance of Sudan and the implications for Sadat of any
                        setback there, it could be helpful to raise the problem privately with the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>, particularly if the Saudis could
                        be persuaded to increase their offer of assistance as an incentive for
                        prompt remedial action by the Sudanese. It was proposed that this subject be
                        raised with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud in his forthcoming visit. With
                        regard to the F–5s for Sudan, there was little we could do to accelerate
                        delivery short of diverting from other countries. Defense is still looking
                        at it, however.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> invited Prince Saud to
                        provide his perspective on the Horn of Africa.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud said that the Saudis see the threat in the area stemming from
                        Soviet intervention through the use of several states, including Cuba,
                            <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, and several East European
                        countries. The Saudis see their intervention, which is not just material aid
                        but direct intervention with personnel, as a new and dangerous element
                        threatening the peace and security of Saudi Arabia, Africa, the Middle East,
                        and ultimately even Europe. Saudi Arabia is against foreign intervention in
                        principle. Involvement of foreign countries complicates problems. Soviet
                        policy is clear in aim, intent, and motivation. What is lacking is a
                        response. Many countries in the area are worried for their integrity and for
                        their internal security, but they have seen no response to the Soviets. No
                        single country or group of countries in the area can see their way to
                        provide such a response because they cannot stand up against the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> unless they have help from the United
                        States—not troops but many other forms of help are needed. People might
                        argue that countries unable to stand up should fall, but even when groups do
                        try to stand up, such as in Angola, there is no response to help them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that the US
                        understands the Saudi concern and disappointment that the US response seems
                        inadequate and slow. This should not lead the Saudis to feel that the US is
                        not concerned; the US is concerned. The US acknowledges that the Soviets
                        have made gains with Cuban aid, but in large part this has resulted from
                        opportunities being presented to them such as in Ethiopia and Somalia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said he knew that Saudi
                        Arabia had tried to urge Haile Selassie to deal with the problems that were
                        looming in Ethiopia but that Haile Selassie paid no attention and as a
                        consequence Ethiopia now has a leftist regime. Then the Somalis led
                        themselves to believe that they would succeed in the Ogaden and as a
                        consequence the Ethiopian regime called in the help of the Soviets and the
                        Cubans. Unfortunately, this was consistent with the African principle of
                        territorial integrity and therefore we did not find African support in
                        opposition to the Soviet/Cuban intervention there. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> also referred to Prince Saud’s
                        awareness of Congressional limitations on the US ability to intervene in
                        such situations. The US tried to influence the Somalis to get out of the
                        Ogaden when the fighting was going on there since we felt that as long as
                        the fighting continued it provided a justification for the Soviets and
                        Cubans to be in Ethiopia. We have discussed the whole question of security
                        in the region with the Somalis, the Sudanese and the Kenyans—the latter are
                        so concerned about the <pb n="215" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_215"/>Somalis that
                        they make common cause with radical Ethiopia in a manner which one would not
                        expect from such a moderate regime.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that the US does not
                        believe that it can give substantial arms to Somalia unless the Somalis give
                        assurances that they will not support the insurgents in the Ogaden. He asked
                        if Prince Saud felt it to be realistic to expect <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> to give such a pledge. He asked if
                        Prince Saud saw any solution to the Ogaden problem through mediation,
                        through the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, through outside good
                        offices?</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud asked if the US was not willing to help Somalia first and then
                        see if the Ogaden problem could be solved. He noted that the Ogaden problem
                        has been there at least since independence. Asking them to do something that
                        is against their national dream is difficult. The Somalis claim that the
                        Somalis in the Ogaden are part of Somalia. If the US says that it will only
                        help if Somalia abandons the Ogaden, the US is putting forward an
                        unacceptable condition. Tribal issues like the Ogaden exist all over Africa.
                        But the Ogaden problem did not become an issue until the Soviets made it
                        one. Nobody except Ethiopia and Somalia can solve the problem between them.
                        Saudi Arabia does not say that one is right and the other is wrong. Saudi
                        Arabia has had no policy of encouraging Somalia to take the Ogaden and Saudi
                        Arabia did not help Somalia with arms until the Soviet and Cuban
                        intervention threatened them. Saudi Arabia does not involve itself in the
                        Ogaden problem. But Saudi Arabia faces a threat from a superpower which is
                        willing to send in vast quantities of aircraft, ships, tanks and men to
                        intervene in a situation near to Saudi Arabia. He said that the US must
                        choose the real problem to confront. The US should not take the position of
                        facing up to the Soviets only if the Somalis abandon the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> expressed the view that the
                        US and Saudi Arabia shared substantially the same strategic objectives of
                        limiting, reducing and hopefully eventually removing the Soviet influence
                        from the Horn of Africa. As far as helping the Somalis, the US is prepared
                        to do so. As we get to looking into how we can go about helping Somalia,
                        then the US has to look at the distinctive characteristics of the situation.
                        It is not enough to say that we must oppose the Soviets. There is the
                        question of Congressional concerns. We must also take into account tactical
                        considerations having to do with Somali internal politics, the position of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, Somalia’s neighbors,
                        Africa-wide considerations. At the end of the Ogaden affair, we felt that
                        the immediate problem was to keep <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> in power and to keep him oriented towards the West and
                        towards his traditional friends in the area, such as Saudi Arabia.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud said: “A very new tradition.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> went on to say that the US
                        hoped to keep <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> from going in the
                        wrong direction. We told him that Somalia’s defensive needs would obviously
                        be great if Somalia continued its aggressive <pb n="216" facs="0251"
                            xml:id="pg_216"/>policy with respect to its neighbors. However, if
                        Somalia wanted to concentrate on development and to live in peace with its
                        neighbors then the US could help.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud asked rhetorically why <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> says he cannot renounce Greater Somalia. Stating that
                        it is impossible for <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> to do so,
                        Prince Saud said that if the United States said to <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> that he must destroy himself in order
                        for the US to help him, then <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>
                        would have to look elsewhere. Greater Somalia is not a goal peculiar to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>; all Somalis think that
                        way. The US cannot ask <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> for
                        something he cannot do. Since Saudi Arabia lives in the region, it feels the
                        problems must be solved there. But the only problem is the Soviet role. The
                        basic problem is not the Ogaden. That has been there forever. The only
                        problem arose when the Soviets involved themselves on both sides of the
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that the US wants to
                        help Somalia in ways which recognize the realities of their politics. We are
                        pleased at the help that Saudi Arabia has provided to Somalia. We have
                        indicated to <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> our desire to help
                        Somalia and we have received from <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> his assurances that he will not use force against his
                        neighbors. It may be, however, that we cannot give <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> what he feels he needs to defend
                        Somalia and to maintain his position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                            >Newsom</persName> said that we would be interested in knowing what
                        Saudi Arabia proposes to do in this situation and he wondered if the US
                        military relationship with Somalia is in any way a condition for Saudi aid
                        to Somalia.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud said that Saudi Arabia has helped Somalia acquire arms already.
                        This help has been based on Somali requirements, not because of any
                        arrangements they may have with others. Saudi Arabia has never associated
                        itself with Somali claims on the Ogaden. Some Arabs did associate themselves
                        with those claims and now find themselves on the other side. This is not
                        true of Saudi Arabia which has followed a constant policy. When Saudi Arabia
                        helped Somalia militarily it was because of the Soviet threat to Somalia.
                        Normally, Saudi Arabia will only give countries economic help. But Somalia
                        was threatened militarily by the Soviet Union and is important to Saudi
                        Arabia. If it can maintain its sovereignty and independence and integrity
                        with help from Saudi Arabia, that is fine. If the US is also going to help,
                        that is also fine.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> said that we are continuing
                        to have contacts with President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                        >Siad</persName>. We have told him that we are prepared to send a military
                        survey team which will place emphasis on the fields of anti-tank weapons,
                        transport and communications. We can go forward on that basis. But as we go
                        forward in Somalia, we must keep in mind that we are dealing with a very
                        complex set of variables in the area and that what one does with one
                        variable will affect others. What we do in Somalia, for instance, has an
                        immediate impact on Kenya, which is a very fragile <pb n="217" facs="0252"
                            xml:id="pg_217"/>entity and a vulnerable target for the Soviets. We wish
                        to help Somalia in a manner which will not increase Kenyan fears.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud asserted that the danger for Kenya is not Somalia but Ethiopia.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> acknowledged this but said
                        that it is difficult to make the Kenyans realize that. Prince Saud said that
                        there are many factions in Kenya, and some are prepared to throw in their
                        lot with Ethiopia and the Soviets. They see where the strength lies. He
                        agreed that Kenya is very important and it is important to strengthen that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> said that he hoped that the
                        US could proceed in Somalia in a way which will bring the Kenyans to realize
                        that Ethiopia and not Somalia represents the danger to them. It is difficult
                        to get this subject going with the Kenyans. We believe that we can manage
                        our relations with Somalia in ways which will be acceptable to the Kenyans.
                        The problem with Kenya is that it is virtually defenseless. Even with
                        Somalia in straitened circumstances militarily after the Ogaden war, Somalia
                        is still well ahead of Kenya militarily. If the Kenyans felt a degree of
                        security in the Northeast Province, such as with a helicopter reconnaissance
                        and anti-tank capability, then the Kenyans would not be so paranoid and it
                        would be possible to talk more rationally with them. In July of 1977 they
                        accepted our rationale about the desirability of assisting Somalia and of
                        lessening Somalia’s dependence on the Soviets.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">In
                            telegram 9450 from Nairobi, July 26, 1977, the Embassy reported on this
                            conversation between Ambassador LeMelle and Kenyan Foreign Minister
                            Waiyaki. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D770267–0331)</note> They lost that rationality when the Ogaden
                        situation blew up. But we still believe that we can deal with these two
                        together.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud said that the Saudis had told the Somalis that the best way to
                        proceed was to patch things up with the Kenyans. However, the Kenyans didn’t
                        want to sign the non-aggression pact offered by the Somalis. He said that
                        all the Kenyans are maneuvering and many are looking where they should go
                        and they see the strength of the Soviets. But it is best to identify the
                        real threat: it is not Somalia or its claims; the threat is the Soviet
                        Union. Somali claims won’t change the region but the Soviets might. Get the
                        Soviets out and then the problems can be tackled. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> observed that, as we build a
                        stronger position for ourselves, that will enable us to gain against the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud said that if the Somalis had been helped to inflict a defeat on
                        the Cubans then the Cubans wouldn’t have felt emboldened to move elsewhere.
                        Referring to Zaire, he said that it would only take 1,000 Cubans to take the
                        whole of Zaire. He asserted that the Cubans would have no trouble
                        controlling Africa. They even picked black <pb n="218" facs="0253"
                            xml:id="pg_218"/>Cubans to send to Africa. Who knows, he asked, whether
                        the blacks attacking Eritrea aren’t Cubans?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> asked what Prince Saud
                        felt could be done about Eritrea? He noted that it was a conflict that had
                        been going on for 17 years, that had involved the United Nations in the
                        past, that many people had tried mediation and that there is the problem of
                        the divisions among the insurgents.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud observed that Eritrea is an entity all by itself which has
                        existed in the past and was then given by the UN to Ethiopia. He said that
                        it is a mistake to refer to it as Moslem. The percentage of Moslems to the
                        total population in Eritrea is less than the same proportion in Ethiopia
                        proper. All of the liberation movements, he asserted, have both Moslems and
                        Christians as well as a few pagans. There was an effort made to foment
                        differences between the Moslems and the Christians, but this has been
                        cleared up in both of the main fronts. They have also agreed to join
                        together. Now they have one command entity and they have agreed to have an
                        integrated movement. Asked if this included the liberation movement with
                        which Saudi Arabia has had a traditional relationship, Prince Saud said that
                        Saudi Arabia had no traditional relationship with any single movement. In
                        the past they have helped refugees from Eritrea in the Sudan and that was
                        the extent of Saudi help. They did not supply one or another movement but
                        all. Asked if he felt there was a role for the UN, Prince Saud said that it
                        is in fact a UN problem. If the UN wants to exercise its responsibility, it
                        may clearly do so.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, who had only shortly before joined the group, asked if it were
                        possible to deal with the Eritrean situation in the UN or if the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> would wish to be seized with it. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> observed that the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> was not at the moment seized formally with
                        the Eritrean problem. Prince Saud observed that the Eritreans will be
                        present at the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit meeting in
                        Khartoum. But since the UN involvement in Eritrea predated the founding of
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, there was no <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> decision concerning Eritrea as such. Asked
                        again about Saudi help to liberation movements, Prince Saud said that
                        individually they are not helping movements but giving aid to all of them.
                        He also said that Saudi Arabia did not help militarily until the movements
                        had gotten together and made a joint military command. The military aid is
                        “non-lethal”, he said.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> summed up by saying that
                        both our countries share concern over the Soviet presence in the Horn of
                        Africa. The US understands the Saudi concern is that the Soviet presence
                        itself is the problem in the Horn and that some indication of opposition to
                        their activities is necessary.</p>
                    <p>Prince Saud said that it is not Saudi Arabia’s business to solve the
                        problems. The problems there were long-existent and became critical <pb
                            n="219" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_219"/>after the Soviets got involved. It
                        is not a question of having to send soldiers. Most African countries are
                        worried about the situation. If they receive backing, they would be prepared
                        to act. He noted that Zambia tried to fight against the Cubans in Angola. If
                        there is a challenger to the Soviet activities, then there will be the
                        backing for that challenger.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> expressed the hope that
                        there will be continuing consultations between the US and Saudi officials.
                        Prince Saud agreed and proposed to send Deputy Foreign Minister Mansouri to
                        Washington for this purpose, a proposal which was welcomed by the US
                        side.</p>

                            perspective of the involved countries and weighs the possible outcomes
                            of the imbroglio. Owing to the fluidity of the situation, we have tended
                            to focus on developments over the next three months, although in looking
                            at the possible outcomes we have gone beyond this time frame. We also
                            would point out that there are gray areas between the various possible
                            courses of development.</hi>

                    <p rend="center">KEY POINTS</p>
                    <p>There are markedly different perspectives among the key groups concerned with
                        the Eritrean situation.</p>
                    <p>—The Soviets, Cubans, and Arab states clearly would prefer a negotiated
                        settlement in Eritrea.</p>
                    <pb n="220" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_220"/>
                    <p>—The Ethiopian regime and the insurgents are not now interested in
                        negotiations except on their own extreme terms. The prospects for
                        negotiations at this time are nil.</p>
                    <p>—The Soviets and Cubans are not prepared to jeopardize their strong position
                        in Ethiopia by exerting heavy pressure to force Addis Ababa to the
                        bargaining table.</p>
                    <p>—The Arab states also are unwilling to cut off their aid to the insurgents to
                        force them to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>—If the fighting went extremely badly for either the Ethiopians or the
                        insurgents, a chance for some type of negotiated arrangement would improve
                        only marginally.</p>
                    <p>The Ethiopians are well along in their preparations for the opening stage of
                        the major Ethiopian military push against the insurgents and the opening
                        stages of the offensive may already have begun.</p>
                    <p>—The degree of Cuban support for this effort is unclear, but at this time it
                        appears to be limited to support activity.</p>
                    <p>—We strongly doubt that the Ethiopians will succeed in suppressing the
                        insurgents, although they may recapture some major population centers and
                        open up some lines of communication.</p>
                    <p>—In favorable tactical situations the insurgents are likely to stand and
                        fight, despite the firepower Ethiopia now possesses. Beyond this, the
                        insurgents are prepared to retreat to the countryside and wage a protracted
                        guerrilla campaign.</p>
                    <p>As time passes, we believe that the Cubans and the Soviets will become
                        increasingly involved in the Eritrean fighting.</p>
                    <p>—Ethiopian leader <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> will press
                        for this if the Ethiopians are unable to defeat the insurgents, and we
                        believe that Havana and Moscow will feel compelled to be responsive.</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>–Their initial involvement is likely to consist of advisory and support
                            activities, but if this kind of support does not bring success to the
                            Ethiopian campaign, we believe that the Soviets and Cubans will commit
                            Cuban combat forces.</p>
                        <p>–Even then they would still hope that at some point a negotiated solution
                            would be possible.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>—With Cuban combat participation, the Ethiopians would be more successful on
                        the battlefield, but they would probably not be able to defeat the
                        insurgents decisively.</p>
                    <p>—The Arab states supporting the insurgents would view Cuban combat
                        involvement as further communist expansion in the Red Sea area, and they
                        would press for some US response.</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>–Independently they would probably increase their support to the
                            insurgents, though none of them would be willing to become directly <pb
                                n="221" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_221"/>involved in the fighting. They
                            also would continue to hope for a negotiated settlement.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>There is a possibility that the fighting will spill across the Ethiopian
                        border into Sudan—a development that might under some circumstances lead
                        Egypt to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">Egypt
                            and Sudan had signed a Mutual Defense Treaty in 1976.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—The Arab states would continue their support to the Eritreans.</p>
                    <p>—Somalia might take advantage of the Ethiopian and Cuban concentrations in
                        Eritrea to step-up guerrilla activities in the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. PERSPECTIVES ON ERITREA</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Ethiopian Perspective</p>
                    <p>1. A number of practical and psychological considerations influence Ethiopian
                        thinking on Eritrea. In practical terms, geographic and economic factors
                        have encouraged Ethiopia’s determination to maintain control of the
                        province. Eritrea has Ethiopia’s only coastline, its only ports, its only
                        petroleum refinery, and its most active portion of the modern sector of the
                        economy. Without the ports of Massawa and Assab, Ethiopia would be dependent
                        on Djibouti for access to the sea.</p>
                    <p>2. Because of Eritrea’s location on the Red Sea and its large Muslim
                        population, the province figures prominently in Ethiopia’s historical fear
                        of “Arab encirclement,” a concern that has increased because of the military
                        regime’s belief that conservative Arab states are supporting the Eritrean
                        insurgency in an attempt to weaken or destroy Ethiopia’s socialist
                        revolution. While some of the rhetoric on this subject is deliberately
                        exaggerated, the Ethiopian leaders genuinely believe that a guerrilla
                        victory would allow Eritrea to be used as a base of operations by the
                        government’s opponents.</p>
                    <p>3. Government leader <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and his
                        supporters also share the previous regime’s fear that making concessions to
                        the Eritreans would encourage many of Ethiopia’s ethnic groups to assert
                        separatist demands. For all the regime’s Marxist rhetoric and assertions
                        about granting ethnic minorities local autonomy, Ethiopia’s rulers are
                        nationalists and determined to maintain the country’s territorial
                        integrity.</p>
                    <p>4. Emotional factors also have probably influenced the intensity of
                        Ethiopia’s desire for a purely military solution to the conflict; to back
                        down after so many years of fighting would be a blow to its pride. The
                        military rulers would be compared unfavorably with Haile Selassie in terms
                        of their ability to hold the Ethiopian empire together.</p>
                    <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] The Ethiopians—even if
                        they were willing to consider compromise—would be unwilling to open talks at
                        present, <pb n="222" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_222"/>while they are at a
                        military disadvantage. Optimism in Addis Ababa following the successful
                        routing of the Somalis in the Ogaden is also encouraging the Ethiopians to
                        proceed with an offensive in Eritrea.</p>
                    <p>6. Ethiopian leaders probably have some doubts about how successful the
                        military will be in Eritrea without direct Soviet and Cuban involvement, but
                        they are confident they will gain ground against the guerrillas—and also
                        confident that the Soviets and Cubans will come to their aid if the
                        offensive runs into trouble. They believe that without Cuban troops they
                        will face a difficult struggle, but they are willing to pay the price in men
                        and resources.</p>
                    <p>7. After achieving initial military objectives, the Ethiopians might offer a
                        figleaf of autonomy to the Eritreans—a deal that the insurgents are most
                        unlikely to accept under any circumstances. In any event, the fighting will
                        continue—at a reduced level—but the situation will remain basically
                        unchanged.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. The Soviet Perspective</p>
                    <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> sees considerable potential for
                        gain from its involvement in Ethiopia, including important local
                        opportunities in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as a chance
                        to advance the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s status as a great
                        power with an expanding presence on the world scene. Moscow wants to replace
                        air and naval facilities that were lost in Somalia—particularly in light of
                        US-Soviet negotiations on forces in the Indian Ocean—and to intimidate
                        Somalia’s Arab and potential Western backers with the warning that Moscow
                        has permanent interest in the area of the Red Sea. The Soviets thus far have
                        perceived few external deterrents to their course of action, and they
                        apparently judge the political risks of US reaction as tolerable and the
                        military risks as negligible.</p>
                    <p>9. Against the background of these overall Soviet goals in Ethiopia, the
                        Soviets are committed to helping <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> resolve the Eritrean issue on terms acceptable to
                        him. Nevertheless, from the Soviet perspective the Eritrean insurgency is a
                        less tractable problem than the Ogaden conflict. The Eritreans are generally
                        perceived as a genuine “national liberation movement,” and Soviet
                        involvement against the insurgents will be harder to justify politically
                        than was support against Somali aggression. To the degree that the Soviets
                        become involved in the counterinsurgency effort in Eritrea, they will
                        antagonize a wider circle of Arab and possibly African states that view
                        Eritrea as an internal affair. There are military constraints as well,
                        particularly the Kremlin’s wish to avoid involvement in a bloody and
                        protracted guerrilla affair, as well as the difficulty—even with Cuban
                        help—of reconquering Eritrea.</p>
                    <p>10. For these reasons, the Soviets would like to mediate the
                        Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict and may try to limit and, in any event, will <pb
                            n="223" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_223"/>certainly make less conspicuous
                        their military support for the approaching military campaign. The Soviets
                        and East Germans have already had contacts with all three guerrilla factions
                        in an effort to forestall a military confrontation. [<hi rend="italic">2
                            lines not declassified</hi>] Both Brezhnev and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> would like <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> to provide some form of autonomy
                        for Eritrea that would preserve Ethiopian sovereignty over the region.</p>
                    <p>11. These efforts to mediate the conflict have produced no visible progress
                        so far, and neither the Soviets nor the Cubans have ruled out an expanded
                        military involvement, including the commitment of Cuban combat troops if
                        necessary. The Soviets presumably realize that Ethiopian success in Eritrea
                        without Soviet involvement would greatly strengthen <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s confidence in his ability to
                        act independently. Moscow may very well believe that the Ethiopians would
                        then be in a better position to defy Soviet entreaties on the need for
                        Ethiopia to create a “vanguard” Marxist-Lenninist party, which Moscow is
                        fostering to consolidate <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s
                        revolutionary regime as well as Soviet influence in the country.</p>
                    <p>12. To protect their equity in Ethiopia, therefore, the Soviets have already
                        assumed a key role in the logistics for the Ethiopian buildup in Eritrea.
                        The Soviet-Ethiopian supply channel is functioning smoothly, and Moscow will
                        certainly continue to funnel military equipment to Ethiopian forces. [<hi
                            rend="italic">5 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>13. If the Ethiopians begin to encounter difficulty on the ground they will
                        demand more from Moscow, and the Soviets will then be placed in a position
                        of having either to support more actively a war that they are hesitant to
                        endorse or—by refusing further support—undermining relations with <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>. Confronted with that choice,
                        Moscow’s gradual—but deeper—involvement in the war would be highly probable,
                        perhaps in time resembling what it did in support of the Ogaden
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. The Cuban Perspective</p>
                    <p>14. The <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> regime is trying
                        assiduously to avoid a major combat role in Eritrea. Havana has temporarily
                        shelved <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s pleas for a
                        combined assault on the secessionist guerrillas and has urged the Ethiopian
                        leader to make a sustained effort to achieve a solution through
                        negotiations. The Cubans—who see possibilities in some form of Eritrean
                        autonomy short of independence—are also using diplomatic channels to smooth
                        the way for a negotiated settlement, but prospects for success appear
                        exceedingly dim.</p>
                    <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Constraints on Cuba</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> has long been alert to the negative domestic reaction
                        that is sure to be generated by heavy Cuban casualties on African
                        battlefields. A recent report indicates that as casualties have mounted in
                        Angola, <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> has become
                        disenchanted with the <pb n="224" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_224"/>continuing
                        military burden there and would prefer to avoid becoming entrapped in a
                        similar protracted conflict elsewhere. Moreover, the Cubans have a healthy
                        respect for the ability of the Eritreans to sustain a guerrilla war. The
                        level of casualties Cuba sustained in the Ogaden—reportedly higher than
                        first indications—has probably also given <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> pause about further Ethiopian combat. In addition,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> acknowledged recently that
                        he would prefer to turn his attention to southern Africa, where the colonial
                        “villains” are more readily identifiable and the risk of antagonizing close
                        allies is less.</p>
                    <p>16. Havana is aware that Cuban combat involvement in Eritrea could jeopardize
                        key elements of its foreign policy. Motivated by ideological affinity and in
                        many cases by a desire to cultivate additional sources of financial
                        assistance, Cuba has given high priority in recent years to broadening its
                        ties with such radical Arab states as Iraq, Syria, Algeria, and Libya. All
                        of these have provided varying degrees of support to the Eritrean
                        separatists, however, and they have all sought assurances that Cuba will not
                        join with the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> government to
                        suppress the Eritreans.</p>
                    <p>17. Cuba covets a leadership position within the nonaligned movement and
                        hopes to take a significant step toward furthering that goal next year when
                        it hosts the nonaligned summit conference. Among the more moderate
                        nonaligned members, there is concern over Cuba’s military involvement in
                        Angola and Ethiopia; some countries have even talked of shifting the venue
                        of the summit. Cuba’s desire to limit the damage to its nonaligned position
                        has doubtless intensified in response to specific warnings by Yugoslavia
                        that Havana should stay out of Eritrea.</p>
                    <p>18. Havana’s commitment to the “world revolutionary struggle” has caused the
                        Cuban leadership to value highly the respect of Third World liberation
                        movements. Many of these movements are sympathetic to the Eritrean cause,
                        and they, as well as the Cubans, realize that the separatists not only
                        command wide popular support at home but that some espouse a Marxist
                        ideology. The <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> regime is keenly
                        aware that, after having helped to train Eritrean guerrillas in Cuba in the
                        1960s and in South Yemen in the mid-1970s, Cuban participation in the
                        quelling of the separatists would leave Havana open to the accusation of
                        failing to pursue a “principled” foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Forces Impelling Cuba To Intervene</hi>. The Cubans
                        have a heavy stake in the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        government, and we do not believe they would stand idly by if it fared badly
                        against the guerrillas. The Cubans clearly hope to avoid a full-scale combat
                        commitment, but to protect their investment they are likely to find
                        themselves drawn gradually into deeper involvement in Eritrea if the
                        Ethiopian offensive flounders. Havana would probably worry that by refusing
                        to help the Ethiopian <pb n="225" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_225"/>leader at
                        that point it would open itself to the criticism that it was knuckling under
                        to US pressure. From his earliest days as a revolutionary leader, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> has acted boldly and impulsively
                        even when the odds were stacked against him. He would be inclined to follow
                        a similar course in Eritrea while trying to minimize the diplomatic
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>20. <hi rend="italic">The Cuban-Soviet Relationship</hi>. In the final
                        analysis, Cuban policy will be linked closely to Soviet guidelines. The
                        Cuban and Soviet positions—in some cases for different reasons—are
                        essentially identical at the present time. Moreover, Havana is so deeply
                        dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> economically and
                        militarily that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> is compelled
                        to pay close heed lest his policies deviate too much from those of his
                        benefactor.</p>
                    <p>21. Realizing how difficult it will be to avoid getting sucked into a combat
                        role, the Cubans have already begun building a rationale to justify such an
                        involvement should it become necessary. Cuban officials have taken the line
                        that the “reactionary” Arabs and Western powers are aiding the Eritrean
                        separatists in order to weaken the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> government and have warned that if this external
                        assistance increases Havana will be forced to respond. By advocating a
                        political settlement and by emphasizing Cuba’s willingness to serve as a
                        broker between Addis Ababa and some of the Eritrean groups, the Cubans have
                        also set the stage for blaming Eritrean intransigence for undermining
                        prospects for peace. In short, the Cubans probably would conclude that if
                        negotiations are not possible and the Ethiopians are unable to suppress the
                        insurgents, they would have little choice but to increase the level of their
                        military involvement in Eritrea.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. The Insurgent Perspective</p>
                    <p>22. Addis Ababa’s preparation for an offensive and the Soviet and Cuban
                        presence in Ethiopia has caused no weakening of the insurgents’
                        determination to continue their military resistance and to adhere to their
                        demand for independence. The guerrillas realize the Ethiopians will deploy a
                        more formidable force than in the past, but—like the Ethiopians—they are
                        optimistic about their prospects and confident they can withstand the
                        Ethiopian drive.</p>
                    <p>23. The guerrillas are probably still heady from their successes of the past
                        three years, during which they greatly expanded their forces and mounted an
                        offensive that drove the Ethiopians into a few enclaves and left the
                        insurgents in control of 90 percent of Eritrea. The guerrillas for almost a
                        year have failed to capture any more government garrisons, despite several
                        major attempts, but their severe mauling of government troops in recent
                        battles has undoubtedly encouraged their confidence about being able to
                        blunt the Ethiopian offensive.</p>
                    <p>24. The insurgents seem realistic about their military capabilities now that
                        Ethiopia has vastly superior firepower. They are probably <pb n="226"
                            facs="0261" xml:id="pg_226"/>reconciled to Ethiopia’s reopening some of
                        the major roads and regaining some of the towns now under insurgent control.
                        The guerrillas may engage in some major conventional battles in order to
                        test the Ethiopians’ mettle, but they are preparing over the long term to
                        wage guerrilla warfare that they believe will prevent Ethiopia from
                        pacifying the province. The guerrillas are well entrenched in the
                        countryside and can count on strong support from the local population.</p>
                    <p>25. The guerrillas’ demand for independence, despite the price the Eritreans
                        are likely to pay in pursuit of that goal, is a measure of their antipathy
                        toward the Ethiopians. The Ethiopians and many of the Eritreans share a
                        common ethnic and religious background, but these links have been submerged
                        by the Eritreans’ belief that they are politically and culturally more
                        advanced than the Ethiopians. The government’s ruthless military tactics of
                        the past few years have reinforced Eritrean hostility toward the Ethiopians.
                        Like the Ethiopians, the guerrillas may eventually think more seriously
                        about compromise, but a shift in policy would require a serious decline in
                        their military position, concessions from Ethiopia, and probably strong
                        pressure to negotiate from the guerrillas’ Arab supporters.</p>
                    <p>26. The guerrillas are probably reasonably confident about their arms
                        situation. They may be uncertain about the willingness of Arab states to
                        meet all insurgent arms requests, especially in the amounts necessary to
                        wage large-scale warfare, but they probably are satisfied they have enough
                        supplies on hand and will receive enough resupplies in the future to conduct
                        guerrilla operations.</p>
                    <p>27. The insurgents realize that division within their ranks prevents the most
                        effective use of their forces, and there are efforts under way to try to
                        form a more unified movement. Whether this succeeds or not, the insurgents
                        will probably paper over their disputes sufficiently to continue the fight
                        against the Ethiopians.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Arab Perspectives</p>
                    <p>28. As long as Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia, most Arabs—albeit for diverse
                        reasons—supported the Eritrean rebellion. The military takeover led Libya,
                        South Yemen, and Algeria to switch sides, convinced that a “progressive
                        regime” had been established in Addis Ababa.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3"
                            >Typically, the position of Libyan leader Qadhafi is somewhat anomalous
                            in that he has recently resumed some degree of support to the

                        remained committed to the Eritrean cause. Alarmed by the increasingly
                        radical stance of the Addis Ababa government, the Saudis stepped up aid to
                        the guerrillas and grew more supportive of Eritrean political
                        aspirations.</p>
                    <pb n="227" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_227"/>
                    <p>29. Despite signals by Moscow and Havana that they intend to avoid a combat
                        role in Eritrea, most Arab governments are unconvinced, and the radical
                        Arabs have been trying to persuade the Soviets and Cubans to refrain from
                        military involvement.</p>
                    <p>30. Iraq, probably the staunchest backer of the Eritrean cause, has made it
                        clear that despite its close ties with Moscow and Havana, Baghdad would take
                        a very dim view of a significant Soviet and Cuban combat role. In its
                        approach to Moscow (and probably also to Havana), Baghdad has warned that
                        “progressive Arab forces” would not react to Soviet support of Ethiopia in
                        Eritrea in the same way as they did to the Soviet-Cuban role against the
                        invading Somalis in the Ogaden. This also seems to be the position of Libya
                        and Algeria.</p>
                    <p>31. The Saudis are appalled by the idea that Moscow or Havana might succeed
                        in getting Ethiopia and Eritrea to agree on a solution based on something
                        short of Eritrean independence. Such a development would enable the Soviets
                        and Cubans to pose as the peacemakers in the region. The moderate Arabs fear
                        that Eritrea eventually will come under Marxist control—either through a
                        compromise settlement or a Soviet- and Cuban-backed offensive against the
                        guerrillas. The Saudis’ worst case scenario evisages Soviet-backed radicals
                        going on to threaten Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, and Kenya, as well as putting
                        pressure on the moderate governments of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                    <p>32. This pessimistic assessment has not led the Arabs to abandon the rebels.
                        Both moderate and radical Arabs, for example, continue to send aid to the
                        insurgents and keep trying to broaden the number of players by raising in
                        various international forums the issue of possible foreign military
                        involvement in the fighting.</p>
                    <p>33. Sudan is particularly fearful of developments in Eritrea, viewing the
                        situation as a potential threat to Sudan itself. Sudan serves as a major
                        sanctuary for and funnel of supplies to the insurgents and the Numayri
                        government has feared that increased fighting with the rebels will spill
                        into Sudan. He has attempted a rapprochement with Addis Ababa to lessen the
                        chances of involvement in the fighting. There is little evidence, however,
                        of any serious effort to reduce the flow of supplies to the rebels.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">F. The African Perspective</p>
                    <p>34. African states are unlikely to have much influence on the Eritrean
                        problem, which they have long been accustomed to consider an internal
                        Ethiopian affair. During the many years the insurgency has been going on,
                        the Organization of African Unity has not given a hearing to the rebels, and
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> African Liberation Committee has
                        not recognized them. This stand is primarily in observance of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>’s principle of the preservation of the
                        territorial integrity of member states; <pb n="228" facs="0263"
                            xml:id="pg_228"/>in addition, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was
                        revered as the founding father of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>,
                        and few Africans were willing to listen to his opponents.</p>
                    <p>35. Some African states oppose a Cuban combat role in Eritrea, and their
                        opposition has been a factor in Soviet and Cuban attempts to limit their
                        involvement in Ethiopian efforts to suppress the insurgency. African
                        reactions, however, are not likely to be strong enough to deter Moscow and
                        Havana from expanding their role. Some Africans would privately express
                        disapproval, but their criticism would be muted by the recognition that the
                        Soviets and Cubans were supporting the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                        >OAU</gloss>’s principle of the inviolability of existing borders. Some of
                        the African states or the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> itself might
                        try to promote negotiations, but they would do so more for form’s sake than
                        for real expectation of being successful.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. POSSIBLE OUTCOMES</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Negotiations</p>
                    <p>36. Attempts to mediate the Eritrean problem have failed, and the near-term
                        outlook for any headway is bleak. The major mediation effort now under way
                        is a Cuban one. In recent meetings in Havana, <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                            >Castro</persName> sought Palestinian and Iraqi help in inducing the
                        insurgents to negotiate, but with no apparent results. The Palestinians are
                        divided in their approach to the insurgents and, in any case, have little
                        leverage on them. Iraq, whose role as the insurgents’ major arms supplier
                        gives it considerable leverage, is unwilling to pressure the Eritreans or to
                        curtail its longstanding investment in what Baghdad views as an Arab
                        nationalist cause.</p>
                    <p>37. The apparent Soviet-Cuban strategy in Eritrea is to split off the
                        Marxists from the non-Marxists in the insurgent movement, to bring the
                        Marxists—primarily the <gloss target="#t_EPLF_1">EPLF</gloss> (Eritrean
                        People’s Liberation Front), plus Marxist elements in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ELF_1">ELF</gloss> (Eritrean Liberation Front)—to the
                        negotiating table with the Ethiopian government, and eventually to set up a
                        Marxist front or government in an autonomous Eritrea that will be prepared
                        to work with Addis Ababa.</p>
                    <p>38. Whatever pressure outsiders may exert for an accommodation, we do not
                        believe that either protagonist will negotiate seriously unless and until
                        the military realities decisively favor that approach. The guerrillas, even
                        if defeated at Asmara, Massawa, and other urban areas, will probably again
                        take to the hills and continue the insurgency, with Arab support. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>, meanwhile, will probably resist
                        any compromise until he has seen whether Ethiopian military power can force
                        the Eritreans to come to terms. If the insurgents remain undefeated but see
                        the military advantage turning decisively against them, they will probably
                        show more interest in negotiations.</p>

                    <p>39. The insurgents appear to be increasingly polarized between leftists and
                        conservatives, but this development does not seem to have advanced the
                        prospects for a deal between the Marxists and the Ethiopian Government.
                            <gloss target="#t_EPLF_1">EPLF</gloss> leaders so far seem no more
                        inclined than other insurgent leaders to negotiate or to abandon the
                        Eritrean demand for complete independence.</p>
                    <p>40. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>, a hardliner on Eritrea
                        and the chief proponent of a military solution, has never gone beyond
                        reiterating his support for the Ethiopian nine-point plan offered in 1976 to
                        the Eritreans. The plan was never precisely formulated, and in its literal
                        interpretation provided autonomy for the various linguistic and cultural
                        groups of Eritrea rather than for the province as such—a clear attempt to
                        destroy the concept of Eritrean nationalism. These provisions gave the
                        Eritreans no reassurances that the Ethiopians would not again seek (as in
                        the 1952–62 federation period) to circumscribe Eritrean autonomy and,
                        finally, to impose tight centralized control from Addis Ababa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. An Ethiopian Military Push</p>
                    <p>41. The Ethiopian military is steadily building up its forces in Eritrea and
                        neighboring Tigre and Gondar Provinces for a major offensive against the
                        insurgents. It now appears that this offensive will continue to unfold
                        gradually over the next few months. Air and, to a lesser extent, ground
                        operations will be hampered, however, by the rainy season in July and
                        August.</p>
                    <p>42. The pace of the fighting in Eritrea has been on the upswing over the last
                        month as government troops, supported by airstrikes, have attempted to
                        loosen the insurgents’ grip on the roads around Asmara. The insurgents, for
                        their part, have mounted repeated efforts to eliminate some outlying
                        Ethiopian garrisons in an attempt to solidify their positions before the
                        weight of government forces can be brought to bear.</p>
                    <p>43. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>44. [<hi rend="italic">6 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>45. The likelihood of Ethiopian success depends, among other things, on how
                        well the Ethiopian troops fight and on how successful they are in sealing
                        off insurgent supply routes from Sudan. On paper the Ethiopian ground and
                        air forces are much stronger than those of the insurgents. However, the
                        combat capability of these forces, in the absence of direct Cuban
                        involvement, has not really been tested—except for that of Ethiopian Air
                        Force pilots, many of whom have shown considerable skill in recent air
                        attacks on Eritrean strongholds.</p>
                    <p>46. The success of the Ethiopian push will also depend in large measure on
                        Eritrean tactics and the degree of cooperation among the three insurgent
                        groups. If the Eritreans respond in such a way as to <pb n="230" facs="0265"
                            xml:id="pg_230"/>present massed formations for Ethiopian air and
                        artillery forces, they will be seriously hurt. The battles of Barentu and
                        Massawa, for example, are indicative of the high casualties the insurgents
                        incur when fighting from fixed positions.</p>
                    <p>47. On the other hand, if the Eritreans conduct a mobile, hit-and-run
                        campaign they could make it very costly for the Ethiopians to pursue the war
                        over a period of a year or two. The insurgents would probably not gain any
                        large or decisive victories over the Ethiopians using these tactics, but,
                        given sufficient time, they could wear the Ethiopians down to a point where
                        Addis Ababa might look more favorably on negotiations.</p>
                    <p>48. On balance, we do not believe that the Ethiopian forces alone will be
                        able to gain a decisive victory over the Eritrean insurgents. They will
                        probably be able to recapture some of the major garrisons now in insurgent
                        hands, and they should open up some lines of communication. Beyond this,
                        Addis Ababa would have to calculate how much more it could accomplish on its
                        own. There would be a concern that the longer term prospect was for a
                        protracted and bloody military struggle in an area where the terrain and the
                        loyalties of the population would favor the insurgents. To make major gains
                        quickly, <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> is likely to look
                        rather early on to his Soviet and Cuban allies for help. (See section C,
                        below.)</p>
                    <p>49. One element of the Ethiopian strategy which could have external
                        repercussions is the closing of the Sudanese-Eritrean border to halt the
                        flow of supplies to the insurgents. An attempt to close the Sudanese border
                        would certainly risk an extension of the conflict into Sudan. The Sudanese
                        are unlikely to be able to prevent Ethiopian incursions, and might in fact
                        turn a blind eye toward limited cross-border forays in order to avoid being
                        drawn into the conflict. The Sudanese have said that, at the most, they
                        would try to defend only military installations if Ethiopian forces cross
                        the border. If Sudan were seriously threatened, Egypt would probably come to
                        its aid.</p>
                    <p>50. Among the other Arab states (and African states as well), the Ethiopian
                        push—which has long been expected—will not occasion any significant change
                        in current postures. Aid to the Eritreans will continue and might even
                        increase somewhat, and Arab leaders will continue their efforts to try to
                        find some way to encourage a negotiated settlement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Increasing Cuban/Soviet Involvement in Eritrea</p>
                    <p>51. The Eritrean situation will entail gradually increasing Soviet and Cuban
                        military support for Ethiopia’s campaign against the Eritrean rebels as it
                        becomes clear that Ethiopia alone has insufficient military capability to
                        quell the insurgents. Once a decision is taken to <pb n="231" facs="0266"
                            xml:id="pg_231"/>increase support in Eritrea beyond current levels,
                        their participation is likely to expand and intensify in stages, not as part
                        of a plan to phase in military resources in predetermined steps, but rather
                        as the result of ad hoc responses to specific needs as they arise.</p>
                    <p>52. The early stages of this increasing involvement are already beginning to
                        take place. For instance, the Soviets have stepped up their logistics
                        support [<hi rend="italic">4½ lines not declassified</hi>]. There is also a
                        good prospect that the Cubans will provide occasional tactical air support
                        against low-risk targets and fly forward air control helicopter missions.
                        Additionally, Soviet naval units may back up Ethiopian patrols sent to
                        interdict seaborne supply routes to the guerrillas, although Moscow is
                        likely to instruct its Red Sea ships to refrain from firing on vessels or
                        shore positions except in self-defense. Finally, augmented involvement on
                        the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is almost certain to
                        entail a greater logistics effort, including more AN–12 transport flights
                        piloted by Soviets, more advisers and technicians assigned to supply and
                        maintenance operations, and perhaps the provision of engineers to airfield,
                        port, and/or road construction projects. The Soviets however almost
                        certainly will not assume a direct combat role.</p>
                    <p>53. Within the next three months, this kind of increased Soviet/Cuban
                        military support for Ethiopia will not lead to an Ethiopian victory, and the
                        insurgents’ basic strength is unlikely to be seriously impaired. In the next
                        three to 12 months, however, substantial and growing Soviet/Cuban
                        involvement in the war would contribute significantly to Ethiopia’s military
                        capacity, to the extent that all major lines of communication and most
                        important cities and garrisons would probably come under Addis Ababa’s
                        control. Nonetheless, we estimate that the guerrillas would still control
                        large portions of the countryside. Havana and Moscow would continue to urge
                        a negotiated settlement in the hopes of avoiding an interminable
                        entanglement in perhaps an unwinnable war.</p>
                    <p>54. Although their level of concern and rhetoric might be heightened, the
                        reaction of Arab countries to this course of events would not differ
                        markedly from that described in paragraphs 49 and 50.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. A Large-Scale Cuban Combat Involvement</p>
                    <p>55. A full-scale Cuban commitment of combat forces could result from several
                        causes: a dramatic military defeat; the failure of the Ethiopian forces to
                        achieve in a reasonable time the defeat in the field of the Eritrean forces;
                        or sufficient military success in the field to bring the Eritrean rebels to
                        negotiate on Ethiopian terms.</p>
                    <p>56. A full Soviet/Cuban commitment to achieve the Ethiopian objectives would
                        involve the transfer of Cuban combat troops now in the Ogaden to Eritrea,
                        commitment of Cuban airpower, and the activa<pb n="232" facs="0267"
                            xml:id="pg_232"/>tion of the Soviet/Cuban battle staff similar to that
                        which directed the campaign in the Ogaden.</p>
                    <p>57. Transfer of the three Cuban mechanized brigades from the northern Ogaden
                        to Tigre would take about a week. Once at the battlefront, these units would
                        probably be committed to eliminating roadblocks and reopening lines of
                        communication. If more imaginative tactics were employed the Cuban brigades
                        could be used in a flanking attack up the western border in an attempt to
                        isolate the insurgents from their sources of supply in Sudan. Such an option
                        would make better use of the mechanized force and serve to minimize Cuban
                        casualties, a major consideration.</p>
                    <p>58. Cuban-piloted aircraft could be committed to the Eritrean campaign in a
                        matter of hours but would not be fully effective immediately. At present,
                        airstrikes against Eritrean targets can be flown only from the Asmara
                        airfield. Unless the roads to Asmara were opened or the new airbase at
                        Makele in Tigre Province completed, the need to fly fuel and munitions into
                        Asmara would seriously restrict the scale of airstrikes against Eritrea. In
                        addition, the flying weather over Eritrea will be relatively poor during
                        July and August.</p>
                    <p>59. Activation of a Soviet/Cuban command center such as the one run by Soviet
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PVI_1">Petrov</persName> in the Ogaden last
                        winter would obviously improve the overall coordination of the Eritrean
                        campaign. <persName corresp="#p_PVI_1">Petrov</persName> and his staff
                        demonstrated the abilty to integrate Cuban and Ethiopian air and ground
                        units and their logistical support in a highly effective campaign against
                        the Somalis.</p>
                    <p>60. If the Cubans were willing to sustain the casualties required to overcome
                        the presumably effective Eritrean defense positions, they should be able to
                        open the roads to military traffic and recapture the major towns in
                        relatively short order. After this is accomplished, the Cubans would
                        probably be withdrawn to garrisons. If these Cuban actions did not bring the
                        rebels to the negotiating table or produce a practical dispersal of the
                        rebel forces, we would foresee a prolonged campaign of pacification in which
                        the Cubans would be extremely reluctant to participate directly and in which
                        the burden of Cuban activity would again fall on the Ethiopian forces.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Neighboring Countries’ Involvement in Eritrea</p>
                    <p>61. Intensified military action in Eritrea is almost certain to have an
                        impact in neighboring Sudan. As Ethiopia pursues its plan to interdict
                        guerrilla supply routes, limited border crossings and violations of Sudanese
                        airspace will become increasingly likely. The terrain in western Eritrea
                        allows the insurgents to avoid roads, so Addis Ababa may eventually decide
                        that the only way to dry up the flow of supplies is to attack its source.
                        This could entail raids on insurgent logistic centers <pb n="233"
                            facs="0268" xml:id="pg_233"/>such as Kassala, a major Sudanese city,
                        opening up the prospect that Khartoum will request military assistance from
                        Egypt. It is highly unlikely however, that Cubans would participate in
                        operations that involved incursions into Sudan.</p>
                    <p>62. Were Cuba to redeploy its major combat units from the Ogaden to Eritrea,
                        Somalia would probably be encouraged to step up military activities in the
                        regions in Ethiopia it recently evacuated. There are indications that Somali
                        guerrillas are already intensifying their harassment of Ethiopian forces,
                        and if Cuban forces were no longer available to deter another Somali
                        incursion into Ethiopian territory, Mogadiscio might be tempted to recommit
                        some regular forces alongside the guerrillas.</p>
                    <p>63. The moderate Arab leaders would almost certainly attempt initially to
                        step up their support to the Eritrean insurgents in the face of increased
                        Soviet/Cuban involvement. This would be coupled with increased emphasis on
                        the need for a negotiated solution to the problem. [<hi rend="italic">3
                            lines not declassified</hi>] For example, we strongly doubt that they
                        would dispatch military forces to Eritrea, although Egypt might be willing
                        to provide some personnel to Sudan as an earnest of Cairo’s concern. The
                        moderate Arabs can certainly be expected to appeal to Washington to take a
                        firm stand, [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>64. The problems for the radical Arab states—Iraq, Syria, Libya, and
                        Algeria—would probably be even more acute. At one time or another, all of
                        them have provided support to the Eritrean insurgents, and they still, with
                        the possible exception of Libya, harbor revolutionary sympathy toward the
                        Eritreans. At the same time, however, each of these radical states are
                        linked rather closely to Moscow and Havana. Caught in this dilemma, they
                        would probably try to find some middle way out to avoid having either openly
                        going in a direction different from that of their Communist friends or
                        appearing to buckle under to them. Iraq could be an exception in that its
                        performance to date suggests that it might well be willing to oppose Soviet
                        or Cuban blandishments openly and to continue to provide support to the
                        insurgents.</p>
                    <p>65. Most Third-World countries would condemn at least privately a sudden
                        escalation of Soviet and Cuban involvement in Eritrea. The countries that
                        have strongly urged the Soviets and Cubans to stay out of Eritrea have not
                        acknowledged the Soviet and Cuban right to intervene under any conditions.
                        Massive Cuban and Soviet involvement in the fighting would be viewed as out
                        of step with the Third World approach to the Eritrean conflict and as
                        intervention in an internal Ethiopian affair.</p>

                                Union, Document 115</ref>)</note> We were refraining from having a
                        military presence in Africa, but the Soviet presence there had increased to
                        alarming proportions. We knew that the Soviet Union was in a position to
                        exert a strong influence on the Cubans. The Soviets usually claimed that
                        Cuba was an independent country that made its own decisions; <pb n="235"
                            facs="0270" xml:id="pg_235"/>we knew, however, of the enormous economic
                        support the Soviet Union was rendering Cuba and could not believe that the
                        Cubans could put 40 or 50 or 60 thousand men into Africa without the Soviet
                        Union’s tacit approval or encouragement. Referring to Zaire and the
                        Katangans’ invasion into that country, the President said we did not believe
                        it to have been possible without Cuban assistance. As for Eritrea, he hoped
                        that the dispute there could be resolved without Soviet or Cuban presence or
                        involvement. With the United Nations we were trying to resolve the difficult
                        questions involving Rhodesia and Namibia, and were doing so without any
                        support on the part of the Soviet Union. He believed that it would be to the
                        advantage of the Soviet Union and of our country to see all the parties
                        involved come together in order to resolve the Rhodesian dispute by peaceful
                        means. In this regard we were also consulting with Britain and other
                        nations. If the Cubans were to refrain from interfering and if the Soviet
                        Union were to lend its active support to our efforts, the Rhodesian problem
                        could be resolved by peaceful means. Namibia was another instance requiring
                        peaceful resolution. The Soviet Union did have an influence it could exert,
                        all the way from public support of our efforts in Rhodesia and Namibia to
                        exercising restraint in the Horn of Africa. He believed that elimination of
                        Soviet-Cuban involvement in Africa would be a contributing factor to the
                        improvement of Soviet-American relations. We were quite concerned and
                        believed the Soviet Union knew that many other nations were equally
                        concerned over Soviet efforts to increase Soviet influence in Africa by
                        supply of weapons and by encouragement of Cuban involvement. The President
                        wanted to express this concern to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                            >Gromyko</persName> and ask him to report to President Brezhnev that we
                        considered this to be an alarming development, one that was still in
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviet
                        leadership had certainly noted some of the President’s recent statements on
                        African matters, which, whether the President liked it or not, also somewhat
                        exacerbated and heated up the atmosphere as regards relations between our
                        two countries. In this connection he was now talking about the specific
                        matters the President had raised in connection with Africa. There was no
                        increasing Soviet presence in Africa. The Soviet Union did not have a single
                        soldier with a rifle in Africa and did not intend to send any to that area.
                        The Soviet Union had indeed sent some quantities of arms to some African
                        countries, as well as a very small number of experts who were helping the
                        Africans master the use of the arms supplied. Not a single Soviet individual
                        had fired a single shot in the course of the latest clashes in Africa, and
                        not a single Soviet individual had taken part in any operation in that part
                        of the world. The Soviet Union had condemned the Somali invasion of
                        Ethiopia, had called it open aggression and had said so directly to the
                        President of Somalia during his visit to Moscow. <pb n="236" facs="0271"
                            xml:id="pg_236"/>Later on President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad
                            Barre</persName> had acknowledged that he had committed aggression. He
                        had asked the Soviet Union to help him extricate himself from that dirty
                        war. The Soviets had told him by way of advice to withdraw all his personnel
                        from Ethiopia and to settle his dispute with Ethiopia by peaceful means.
                        Quite recently, virtually several days ago, he had admitted that his
                        invasion of Ethiopia had been a mistake and had asked the Soviet Union for
                        help. The Soviet Union had given him some good advice—to withdraw all his
                        personnel and arms from Ethiopian territory. Further, <persName
                            corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had already told Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> that the Soviet Union had
                        insistently advised the Ethiopians, including <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>, to refrain from having Ethiopian troops invade
                        Somali territory.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> met in New York on May 25. See
                                <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d109">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. VI, Soviet
                                Union, Document 109</ref>.</note> The Soviet Union had indeed
                        supplied weapons to Ethiopia since Ethiopia had been a victim of aggression.
                        Frankly speaking, he felt the United States, too, would have been fully
                        justified if it had helped Ethiopia, since under the U.N. Charter a victim
                        of aggression is entitled to receive assistance on an individual as well as
                        a collective basis. That would have been up to the United States, of course,
                        he was just mentioning this in passing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> expressed the hope that the
                        President was in possession of authentic information regarding the role of
                        the Cubans in Ethiopia. The Ethiopians had asked Cuba for assistance just as
                        they had asked the Soviet Union and other countries for assistance. It was
                        very hard indeed to speak of numbers, because the numbers of Cubans involved
                        there, as mentioned by the President, were exaggerated at least tenfold. He
                        believed that the Somalis were deliberately exaggerating these numbers and
                        that the United States was not sufficiently critical of the information it
                        received from the Somalis. Incidentally, the Cubans, like the Soviets, had
                        advised the Ethiopians not to cross the border into Somalia. The Soviet
                        Union was indeed consulting with Cuba from time to time, but to speak of
                        some sort of coordinated Cuban-Soviet plan, etc., was absolutely wrong.</p>
                    <p>As for Eritrea, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out
                        that the Soviet position was that Eritrea should enjoy a broad autonomy
                        within a united and sovereign Ethiopian state. The Soviets had said this
                        many times to the Ethiopian leadership. This was not the same situation as
                        had been the case with Ogaden. Each of these issues had its own specific
                        aspects which were quite different from case to case. The Soviet Union had
                        called upon the Ethiopian leaders not to permit any bloodshed in Eritrea and
                        to settle the dispute there by peaceful means. The Soviet Union had
                        expressed this position to the Cubans as well, and they in turn had told the
                        Soviets that their position in this respect was identical. <pb n="237"
                            facs="0272" xml:id="pg_237"/>There was not a single Cuban soldier
                        fighting in Eritrea today. The Soviet leadership had been informed that this
                        was <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>’s firm position. As
                        for further developments in that area, he was not at all sure that there
                        would not be further bloodshed there. After all, there were certain circles
                        outside that area, who urged the Eritreans to resist a peaceful settlement.
                        What was more, Ethiopia, too, was not totally in sympathy with arriving at a
                        peaceful settlement. If the Ethiopians had not been restrained by the
                        Soviets and by the Cubans, blood would have flowed there long ago. Whether
                        or not one could succeed in restraining them over a period of time,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not know, but the
                        Soviet Union was working in that direction. In Ethiopia the Soviet Union was
                        a factor restraining hostilities rather than a factor prodding military
                        action. To what extent this would be successful in the future he could not
                        now predict. The Soviets had learned that one could not rely on the word of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad Barre</persName>. If the United States
                        had not learned that lesson yet, he was sure it would reach that conclusion
                        soon. At the time when the Soviet Union had supplied weapons to Somalia, it
                        had been done on the condition that these weapons would not be used against
                        third countries, but only for self-defense. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad Barre</persName> had given the Soviet Union a pledge to that
                        effect, but everyone knew what had happened subsequently.</p>
                    <p>As for Rhodesia, Namibia and Zaire, he could tell the President firmly that
                        the Soviet Union had no representatives in that area, not even news
                        correspondents, and did not intend to send any representatives there. The
                        Soviet Union knew absolutely nothing about the recent actions of the
                        so-called gendarmes of Katanga. The very word brought back memories of the
                        period when Tshombe had been in charge.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> noted that the President had
                        spoken of the influence the Soviet Union had in Rhodesia and Namibia. If he
                        had referred to ideological influence, he might have been right, because for
                        many years the Soviet Union had argued against colonialism and racism. That
                        was no secret. He would only point out that ideological influence knew no
                        barriers at all. As for anything else, absolutely nothing was being done. He
                        would guess that the President had received reports to the effect that the
                        Soviet Union wanted to lay its hands on the entire area; he would tell the
                        President, however, that the Soviet Union was doing absolutely nothing in
                        that area, and knew nothing of the developments there except what was
                        reported in the press. The Soviet Union was not sending any people to that
                        area. He could imagine the hue and cry throughout the world that would be
                        raised if any Soviets or Cubans travelled to Rhodesia or Namibia. They did
                        not have a single representative there, unlike the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to say a few words
                        about Zaire. Whatever he knew about the recent invasion there, he knew from
                        the reports of <pb n="238" facs="0273" xml:id="pg_238"/>various press
                        agencies and the reports of the Soviet representative in Zaire. The Soviet
                        chargé d’affaires had been called in to see <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                            >Mobutu</persName> recently and had been informed that some Katangan
                        gendarmes had invaded the territory of Zaire from Angola. The Soviet Union
                        had not even known of their presence in Angola. As for the Cubans, not a
                        single Cuban had been caught or even seen in that invasion. Yet, for some
                        reason people had started to blame first the Soviet Union and then the
                        Cubans. He had questioned the Cubans at a very high level about this
                        invasion and had been told that Cuba had absolutely nothing to do with the
                        whole matter. The Soviet Union wanted to maintain good relations with Zaire
                        and the Soviet chargé had said so to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                            >Mobutu</persName>. After all, what would President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> want done? If there were some
                        refugees in Angola who subsequently crossed the border into their own
                        country, what should be done with them—should they be shot? They seemed to
                        be running from repression. So much for the situation in Zaire. The
                        President would note that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        said quite a few things about all these areas. As for Namibia, the Soviet
                        Union was not looking for anything at all in that country and it had
                        accordingly informed the British. On the other hand, the Soviet Union was
                        totally against keeping the blacks in Rhodesia in bondage. 24 out of 25
                        people there were black, and the Soviet Union had stated that it was in
                        favor of the majority of the people themselves deciding what kind of a
                        government they should have. He could not agree with the thesis that
                        foreigners would know best what should be done in Rhodesia. The Soviet Union
                        was saying this, and that was no secret. That was its position of principle,
                        based on its ideology. Soviet policy throughout the world was based on the
                        premise that people were their own best masters.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to thank
                        the President for the great patience he had displayed. Knowing how busy the
                        President was, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        nevertheless taken a great deal of his time, but this was so because the
                        questions they had discussed were very important. The President had made
                        some statements, as had others, reflecting on the state of our bilateral
                        relations. That, too, was important and therefore <persName
                            corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had provided appropriate
                        explanations. The Soviet Union had no designs on Africa at all. The
                        President could rest assured that the Soviets did not want to lay their
                        hands on Africa; the Soviet Union had a large enough territory of its own
                        with much to do there. He would draw the conclusion that it was necessary
                        for our two countries to consult with each other more frequently, and to
                        explain our respective views of the situation to each other. That should be
                        done in person rather than just by written communications.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would respond briefly. U.S. assessment of the same
                        situation was quite different from the assessment <persName
                            corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        <pb n="239" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_239"/>had provided. We looked at the Horn
                        of Africa with a great deal of concern. From our perspective, the Somalis
                        had invaded Ogaden using Soviet weapons. We understood that the Ethiopian
                        response there had been directed by a Soviet general. While the Soviet Union
                        had not sent troops to the area, the Cubans had sent more than 15,000 men.
                        We recognized that the Soviet Union and the United States had persuaded the
                        Ethiopians not to cross the Somali border once the Somalis had been pushed
                        out of Ogaden. However, Soviet generals and Cuban officers remained, perhaps
                        directing combat against Eritrea. The Cubans had said that they were not
                        involved directly, that they had no troops in combat status in Eritrea. We
                        certainly hoped that was the case. In Angola the Cuban presence had recently
                        increased to 20,000 troops plus service personnel. The Katangans, to whom
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had referred as refugees,
                        had certainly been trained and supported by the Cubans in Angola and perhaps
                        by some East Germans. In Zaire a major military force had appeared, well
                        supplied with Soviet weapons. It had destroyed Kolwezi with major loss of
                        life. The President had no doubt that the Soviet Union could have prevented
                        that if it had used its influence with the Angolans, the Cubans and the East
                        Germans, all of whom depended upon the Soviet Union to a great extent. The
                        President had not claimed that the Cubans had troops in Zaire, but he did
                        not doubt that the invaders had been encouraged and supplied by those allies
                        of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to the Horn of Africa.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Africa</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued his response to the
                        President on African matters. He called the presence of a Soviet general in
                        Ethiopia a myth. Had the Soviet Union been invited to send a general there,
                        it would have refused. There was no Soviet Napoleon in Africa. Evidently the
                        President was being fed completely fantastic information. As for the Cuban
                        presence, the Soviet Union had information that in Angola the number of
                        Cubans was being reduced rather than increased. The President’s reference to
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> personnel in connection with
                        Kolwezi could not be regarded as authentic. Even the U.S. press had not
                        alleged anything of the sort. As for the invasion into Zaire, the press had
                        first reported that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                        soldiers in the area were shooting blacks, then that blacks were shooting
                        whites, whites were shooting blacks, and had spoken of certain rebels. The
                        situation appeared to be totally confused, but there was certainly no Soviet
                        or Cuban involvement there.</p>

                        increasing support for Ogaden guerrillas and willfully deceiving us. A
                        clique in State and the Pentagon who are opposed to practically everything
                        else you stand for persists in trying to demonstrate a dubious toughness and
                        concern about Soviet actions in Africa by trying to justify shipping arms to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>. There would be a case for
                        a very modest arms relationship with a genuinely peaceful Somalia. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> is objectively serving Soviet
                        purposes by fanning tension in the Horn and providing a justification for
                        continued Cuban presence to help defend the Ogaden against Somali
                        incursions. Guerrilla activity in the Ogaden is again approaching the level
                        of intensity that prevailed last year at this time. This could lead in the
                        next few weeks to retaliatory strikes by the Ethiopians/Cubans against
                        Somalia itself. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> could see
                        certain advantages in doing this.</p>
                    <p>In opposing what the Soviets are doing in Africa we have to be careful not to
                        take under our wing everyone who happens to have got into the position of
                        opposition to Africans whom the Soviets are supporting. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> is fundamentally more responsible
                        than anyone else for the massive Soviet/Cuban presence in the Horn today.
                        Supporting him is not going to further the process of defeating the Soviets
                        and Cubans in Ethiopia. Nor is supporting the Eritreans going to do Soviet
                        and Cuban interests in Ethiopia much harm either. Not that we have done
                        either of these things—but naive arguments for doing so are <pb n="241"
                            facs="0276" xml:id="pg_241"/>again being advanced with increasing
                        frequency. And some of our Middle Eastern friends, such as the Saudis and
                        the Iranians, seem to be inclined to think that increased support for the
                        Eritreans and for Somali guerrilla operations harms the Soviets and
                        undermines <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>. Ultimately, it
                        does not really have this effect. It only compounds the confusion and
                        complicates pursuit of our policy objectives in the region and in Africa and
                        the Middle East as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Our ultimate aim in the Horn should be to get the Soviets out of Ethiopia,
                        reestablish our own position there, and, meanwhile, maintain a strong
                        position in the two other key countries in the region, Sudan and Kenya.
                        Somalia is of only incidental importance. Unattractive as <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> is, we have to make do with him
                        for the time being. His internal position is strengthened by the Somali
                        guerrilla threat and, to some degree as well, by the Eritrean stalemate.
                        Persistance of both threats forces him into greater reliance on the Soviets
                        and Cubans even though tensions are developing between them and the
                        Ethiopians over Eritrea. Easing of the pressure on Ethiopia, on both the
                        Somali and Eritrean fronts, would lessen Ethiopian dependence on the Soviets
                        and Cubans, permit freer development of tensions between the Ethiopians and
                        their Communist friends, and encourage internal opposition to <persName

                        increasingly third-force or pro-Western as frustration over the Soviet/Cuban
                        connection causes intelligent Ethiopians to realize that the country’s
                        problems cannot be settled within the framework of a Soviet-Cuban alliance.
                        The Kenyans, and eventually the Sudanese, can be helpful in encouraging the
                        kind of political evolution in Ethiopia that is in our long-term interest.
                        Somalia has no role to play in this.</p>
                    <p>The Saudis and the Iranians would be using their resources to much better
                        effect if they invested them in helping people such as the Zaireans,
                        Savimbi, and Kaunda rather than pouring them down the Eritrean and Somali
                        ratholes. They will do much more to frustrate Soviet and Cuban designs in
                        Africa by helping build up countries and leaders who want to orient
                        themselves genuinely toward the West than by supporting Marxists such as

                        problem in Ethiopia becomes more and more dubious as one considers its real
                        political effect and its long-term implications. It leads nowhere.</p>
                    <p>If my argumentation seems arcane and complex, remember that Africa occupies a
                        position in great-power rivalries today similar to that which Eastern Europe
                        and the Balkans had during the era 1870–1940. Real, often intractible local
                        issues underlay the cross-currents generated by outside political and
                        ideological competition. The powers that lost <pb n="242" facs="0277"
                            xml:id="pg_242"/>most in Eastern Europe were those who became too
                        entangled in pursuit of short-term tactical gains and who failed to avoid
                        the traps and snares of dogmatic nationalism and self-seeking local
                        politicians. The Russians eventually picked up <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                        the pieces.</p>
                    <p>To counter the Russians and the Cubans effectively in Africa, we need to
                        operate in a framework of political principles that will stand the test of
                        time and a strategic concept that can be defended in terms of our own basic
                        national interests.</p>
                    <p>If we write off Ethiopia as lost to the Soviets and then entangle ourselves
                        and our allies in petty efforts to support anti-Ethiopian forces under the
                        illusion that we are making things more difficult for the Soviets in
                        Ethiopia, we are not serving our purposes well. We will end up keeping the
                        area so destabilized that we will lose out in Sudan and Kenya, too. Rather
                        than being swept along by naive and limited Saudi and Iranian perceptions of
                        where their interests lie, we should take the lead, take advantage of their
                        concerns to draw them into a grander plan for building resistance to
                        Soviet/Cuban encroachments in Africa (and in the Middle East, the soft
                        underbelly of Asia, as well) and help them apply their resources to
                        endeavors that have a positive purpose and a real chance of success,
                        e.g.:</p>
                    <p>• Get Saudi-Iranian financial backing for Zaire, as well as support for
                        military strengthening of this country.</p>
                    <p>• Get Saudi-Iranian backing for a pan-African defense force.</p>
                    <p>• Draw the Saudis and Iranians into more energetic support of Sudan and
                        support of Kenya by convincing them that this will be a much better
                        investment of their resources than support of Somali-backed Ogaden
                        insurgency and the Eritrean rebellion.</p>
                    <p>• Persuade the Saudis and the Iranians to invest a bit in Zambia, to ease its
                        financial problems.</p>
                    <p>• Use the Saudis and Iranians as a substitute for the help we seem to be
                        unable to provide ourselves for Savimbi.</p>
                    <p>• Stop indulging <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> and pretending
                        that we are going to do an arms deal with him. Instead suggest to the Saudis
                        and the Iranians (and anyone else who could help them) that they encourage
                        his replacement by real pro-Western leaders who will devote their energies
                        to developing Somalia’s own resources and forget about guerrillas. (The
                        notion that change in Somalia must be back to a pro-Soviet regime is
                        fallacious; <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, the most

                    <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to sum up what seems to be happening in the
                        Horn now, to look at where the future may lead and to consider U.S. policy
                        interests in relation to these developments.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Ethiopia:</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> appears to be firmly in
                        control, but he does not have the country as strongly behind him for his
                        Eritrean effort as he did for the fight against Somalia. Rather substantial
                        strains have developed between <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> and the Soviets and Cubans but there is no sign of
                        irreparable antagonism. Both sides still see more advantage in cooperation
                        than in permitting a falling out. The Cubans and Soviets have drawn careful
                        lines to preclude direct involvement in Eritrean fighting. The more
                        successful the Ethiopians are in Eritrea (and they have been doing well
                        recently), the less pressure there will be for more direct Cuban
                        involvement. Strains between the Soviets and <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> are likely to develop more over questions of
                        consolidation of the revolution in Ethiopia, organization of a leading
                        political party and suspicions on <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>’s part that the Soviets are scheming against him
                        than over Eritrea. The new Cuban and Soviet ambassadors who will be arriving
                        on the scene shortly are probably going to be charged with working out a new
                        political balance with <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and
                        a basis for longer-term exercise of influence in the country.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, signs that <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> wants
                        to keep openings to the West have multiplied. Our new ambassador has been
                        relatively warmly received.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d82fn4">footnote 4, Document 82</ref>.</note> A
                        long-postponed major aid project has been given the go-ahead. There are
                        signs that the problem of compensation for nationalized property may be
                        amenable to settlement. Underlying pro-American sentiment in Ethiopia is
                        stronger than ever, as firsthand experience of Soviets and Cubans results in
                        accumulation of grievances. In much of the country revolutionary changes are
                        at a standstill. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> has bought
                        the backing of the population by permitting life to run its accustomed
                        course. Economic strains, however, are growing, and infla<pb n="244"

                        much of the third world, Ethiopia is still in remarkably good economic
                        shape. A good harvest this year and the ability to export via the railroad
                        to Djibouti will probably prevent serious economic strains in the near
                        future. The problem of payment for massive Soviet military aid, which is
                        still arriving in accordance with earlier commitments, could become a
                        serious issue if Moscow presses it.</p>
                    <p>We have been on a consistent course in respect to Ethiopia since the

                        was quickly accepted and indications are that we will now have much more
                        constructive dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>
                        and other senior officials. Our capacity to influence thinking and events in
                        the country, still extremely limited, should gradually improve. Ethiopia
                        remains the most important country in the Horn. It is in our interest to
                        rebuild our influence there.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Ogaden:</hi> The Ogaden remains in an unsettled state
                        and Cuban involvement there still appears necessary for the Ethiopians.
                        Guerrilla activity has been energetically and imaginatively supported and,
                        in large part, directed by the Somali Government. As long as the Somalis
                        persist in encouraging the guerrillas and as long as they receive sufficient
                        weapons and supplies from abroad to pass on to them, a fair level of
                        guerrilla harassment can probably be maintained. There is no evidence that
                        the Ethiopians have had difficulty re-establishing their control over major
                        cities on the northern fringe of the Ogaden: Diredawa, Harar and Jijiga.
                        There is increasing evidence that impatience with the guerrilla situation in
                        the Ogaden is driving <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> (and
                        others) to consider more decisive retaliatory moves against Somalia than the
                        minor air attacks that have been carried out in recent weeks. Progress in
                        Eritrea will embolden <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> for
                        harsher action against Somalia. The Soviets are apparently discouraging him
                        from considering invading, but they could come to see advantage in
                        permitting him to do so in the expectation that his improved relations with
                        the U.S. and key European countries would be disrupted and the West would be
                        pushed into backing Somalia.</p>
                    <p>We should continue to point out to <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>, as we did last February, that he has more to gain
                        by being patient and resisting the temptation to invade Somalia’s own
                        territory than he can ever hope to accomplish by invasion.</p>

                        is not clear that the commitment to support Ogaden insurgency is as intense

                        timing, not the fundamental desirability of uniting all Somalis in one
                        state.</p>
                    <p>Less has been heard about an immediate Somali threat to Kenya in recent
                        weeks, but no real progress has been made toward reconciliation between the
                        two countries. Kenyans are so suspicious of <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> personally that acceptance of guarantees from <hi
                            rend="italic">him</hi> may never be possible. A post-<persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> leadership might be able to effect
                        reconciliation with Kenya.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Mediation Committee dealing with the
                        Ogaden dispute has just come out again for the Ethiopian position in its
                        report in Khartoum, but for all practical purposes it has no immediate
                        relevance to settlement of the dispute. African opinion is more solidly
                        behind Ethiopia than ever. As if Somalia were not already sufficiently
                        alienated from African opinion on the territorial integrity question, her
                        dickering with South Africa (about which there have already been accusations
                        on the Ethiopian radio) will make her a total pariah if it becomes pubicly
                        confirmed and widely known.</p>
                    <p>Internally <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s position appears to
                        be gradually weakening. It has become clear that his main opponents are not,
                        as he has tried to maintain, pro-Soviet officers. They are officers who are
                        united in their resentment that he gambled on invading Ethiopia and failed
                        and officers and civilians who resent what they regard as his discrimination
                        against Northerners and intense favoritism toward his own Marehan tribesmen.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> himself has made (and
                        continues to make) overtures to the Soviets for a reconciliation; the
                        Soviets have rebuffed him. In spite of repeated public professions of
                        anti-Soviet and pro-Western convictions, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> has not dismantled the “socialist” police state in
                        Somalia and has kept practically all of the officials once reputed to be
                        most pro-Soviet in office. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has
                        shown little enthusiasm for the idea of concentration on economic

                        of worthwhile project proposals.</p>
                    <p>After weeks of delay and argumentation, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"

                        military aid commitment. Our own position in Somalia is neither stronger nor
                        weaker than it has been at any time in the past year and a half. The
                        disadvantages of our becoming identified with <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> insofar as the rest of Africa is concerned, the problem
                        of presumed tacit support of his guerrilla operations in the Ogaden if we
                        provide military aid and the prospect of having anything we do or say to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> misrepresented are even
                        more serious obstacles now than they were six months ago to trying to work
                        out a modest, rational effort for supporting Somalia. It may be more
                        difficult now to offset the adverse effects of support for <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> with Ethiopia and Kenya than it would
                        have been six months ago because <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName>’s refusal to meet the conditions set by the President

                    <p>So what is to be done in respect to Somalia? Bide our time in hope that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> will be replaced by a
                        leadership more committed to Western values, internally less identified with
                        the failure of the Ogaden adventure, and prepared to moderate its
                        irredentist policies in the interest of making the most of what Somalia
                        has.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Kenya:</hi> Reports of deterioration of <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName>’s health and mental condition
                        persist, but there is no evidence of political instability in Kenya. The
                        Kikuyu leadership that is already running the country appears likely to be
                        able to weather any immediate problems that could arise from <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName>’s death. The sense of immediate
                        threat from Somalia has subsided but prospects for reconciliation are poor.
                        Having been aroused to concern over their military weakness, Kenyans are
                        unlikely ever to revert to the complacency that prevailed until recently.
                        The Kenyan leadership is realistic about what is going on in Ethiopia, but
                        still sees Ethiopia as a more acceptable ally than any other in the area,
                        though relations with Sudan are good. While our military survey team that
                        went to Kenya this spring may not have been as politically and tactically
                        skillful as we could have hoped and Kenyans may be disappointed by the
                        modesty of our military aid offers, the symbolism of expanding their
                        military relationship with the United States is important to them and
                        prospects for working out a sound military aid relationship are good. It
                        remains very much in our interest to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets may be tempted to become more politically active in
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName> Kenya—both making
                        offers for military and economic cooperation and engaging in covert
                        political maneuvering. We need <pb n="247" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_247"/>to
                        remain alert to such maneuvering and work closely with the Kenyans to
                        counteract it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Eritrea:</hi> Nothing has changed in respect to the
                        fundamentals of the Eritrean situation. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> is pursuing a military solution with formidable
                        commitments of manpower and materiel. His efforts are now beginning to pay
                        off. There is new evidence of dissension among Eritrean rebel groups. Though
                        substantial aid still flows to Eritrean rebels from Arab sources, the rebels
                        have made no significant gains in support for their advocacy of
                        independence. In fact, they have recently lost ground. The Sudanese, who
                        fear an independent Eritrea, are ready to play a major role in a negotiated
                        solution. If significant victories by the Ethiopians could be followed by
                        more forthcoming offers of concessions that would permit a political
                        solution, something representing a return to the 1952 UN principles, the
                        Eritrean issue could still be settled and conservative Arab support for
                        retention of an autonomous Eritrea within Ethiopia could probably be
                        secured.</p>
                    <p>Our cautious policy on Eritrea, including recognition of Ethiopia’s
                        territorial integrity and of the UN settlement of 1952 as the most practical
                        basis for association of Eritrea with Ethiopia remains sound and we should
                        stick to it.</p>
                    <p>It remains in our long-term interest to attempt to deny the Soviets permanent
                        bases on the Ethiopian (i.e. Eritrean) Red Sea coast, either at Assab,
                        Massawa or in the Dahlak Islands. Whatever chance we have of achieving this
                        aim will depend on continued recognition of Eritrea as part of Ethiopia and
                        improvement of our relations with the Ethiopian government in the hope that
                        we can encourage nationalistic Ethiopians to see the disadvantages of
                        permanent base rights for the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>We should not attempt to play anything other than an indirect and peripheral
                        role in a negotiated settlement in Eritrea unless and until (a) there are
                        good prospects that it can succeed and (b) there is a unique role that we
                        can play. Of our allies, Italy is the best suited for a mediating role in
                        Eritrea or, eventually, between Ethiopia and Somalia. Conservative Arab
                        countries—and foremost among them the Sudan, should also be persuaded to
                        contribute to this effort.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sudan:</hi> Everything about our relationship with the
                        Sudan continues to be positive. Our modest military aid effort is going
                        well. Sudan’s internal political reconciliation has so far been successful
                        beyond anyone’s expectations. Sudan has handled the complex Eritrean problem
                        with remarkable maturity. The Sudan’s main problems are economic and recent
                        agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> promises to keep
                        these problems from getting worse and set them perhaps, on the road to
                        longer-term solution. We should continue to be guided, when we need
                        guidance, by the Sudan’s perceptions of Horn problems, both in respect to
                        Eritrea and Somalia. <persName corresp="#p_NG_1">Nimeiry</persName>’s grasp
                        of these issues is far more relevant and pertinent than those of most of the

                        around Djibouti. As long as the French remain militarily and as long as
                        Ethiopia and Somalia can both be prevailed upon to avoid actions that could
                        cause the fragile political structure there to fall apart, Djibouti will
                        remain in a state of delicate political balance for the short term at least,
                        and this is in our interest. The Soviets may have their eye on Djibouti. It
                        has some advantages as a base over the Ethiopian ports. We do not want them
                        to establish themselves there—but it would be a lesser evil for them to end
                        up with a foothold there and none elsewhere in the Horn rather than to see
                        them consolidate a long-term presence in Ethiopia, return to Somalia or gain
                        influence in either Kenya or Sudan. In the medium-to-longer run, Djibouti
                        might be a pawn around which a territorial trade-off and settlement between
                        Ethiopia and Somalia could eventually be contrived.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary of U.S. Interests:</hi> Ranked in order of
                        intrinsic importance (population, resources, strategic significance),
                        Ethiopia remains the most important country in the Horn, followed by Sudan,
                        Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti. We should aim to reassert ourselves in the most
                        important country, Ethiopia, maintain our increasingly strong position in
                        Sudan and Kenya and look upon Somalia and Djibouti as essentially marginal.
                        During the past year, we have successfully avoided succumbing to pressures
                        from the Saudis, Egyptians, and Iranians to become identified with <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s Somalia in ways which could
                        preclude reasserting ourselves in Ethiopia. The dramatization of Somalia as
                        a country which defied and broke with the Soviets and therefore deserved
                        Western support was always overdone and the importance of this consideration
                        has waned in recent months as <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>
                        has been increasingly seen for what he is: a military dictator who was very
                        comfortable running a Soviet-style system but could not convince the Soviets
                        that Somalia was more important than Ethiopia when he used their arms to
                        make war. Somalia, as a country, deserves better, but we will not be serving
                        either our own or the Somali people’s interests by catering even to the
                        illusion of military support for <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"

                    <p>The Horn remains an important area. Its proximity to the Arabian Peninsula,
                        to the “soft underbelly” of Asia and its relationship to the Indian Ocean,
                        all contribute to its strategic significance. Africa and the Middle East
                        meet here. Sixty to seventy million people live in these countries and we
                        have taken a constructive interest in all of them in the past and remain
                        concerned about their economic and social development and their human
                        rights. The fact that this Administration became so concerned about the Horn
                        this past year obligates us to seek ways of asserting ourselves
                        constructively in the region. But we will assert ourselves effectively only
                        if we keep our long-term objectives in mind and avoid tactical pitfalls. We
                        have done well in this respect in <pb n="249" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_249"

                    <p>This meeting has been <hi rend="italic">called at the initiative of <persName

                        Key questions are: Do we send a military survey team to Mogadiscio? Do we
                        still consider military aid for Somalia a likely prospect?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">State’s paper</hi> is attached at TAB A.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d88fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> It is rigorously
                        objective and lists the pro’s and con’s of moving toward a military supply
                        relationship with Somalia. Then it offers six action options:</p>
                    <p>1. Offer Somalia an impact package of military equipment without sending a
                        survey team.</p>
                    <p>2. Reschedule the survey team’s visit while reiterating to the Somali
                        Government that further evidence of Somali involvement in the Ogaden might
                        again force postponement.</p>
                    <p>3. Inform the Somali Government explicitly of the conditions under which we
                        would be willing to send the survey team.</p>
                    <p>4. Defer any decision on the survey team.</p>
                    <p>5. Cancel the survey team outright and inform <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> that U.S. will not enter into a military supply
                        relationship with Somalia.</p>
                    <p>6. Take other actions to demonstrate continued U.S. interest in the
                        U.S.-Somali relationship.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> The President has approved a ship visit and one
                        is being scheduled in September.)</p>
                    <p>As you will see, the first five are mutually exclusive; Option Six can be
                        combined with any of the others.</p>

                        This course would commit us to nothing and give us maximum flexibility in
                        the future.</p>

                        memorandum on the <hi rend="italic">availability of military aid

                        available. He also cautions about the implications of sending a survey team
                        and argues that it will inevitably be taken as implying some degree of
                        commitment to supply aid.</p>

                        your preferences are. Zbig?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: I favor a combination of Options 2 and
                            6.<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">These options are listed in <ref

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CV_1">CV</gloss>: Would you schedule or postpone a team
                        visit?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: I would prefer to postpone it without a
                        date. We don’t want to give them the feeling that we are dropping it
                        entirely.</p>
                    <pb n="251" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_251"/>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CV_1">CV</gloss>: Maybe you really prefer Option 4
                        then?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Four is all right too, but I read its
                        implications as too negative and too passive—we just don’t do anything. We
                        should tell the Somalis we are postponing it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CV_1">CV</gloss>: What about combining these actions with
                        assignment of a military attache?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: That is part of Option 6.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CV_1">CV</gloss>: But the attache could not discuss a
                        military supply relationship—he should simply be a military attache, have
                        contacts with the military and gather intelligence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_McG_1">McG</gloss>: There would not be an exchange of
                        intelligence. But I can think of other things we might do—regularize ship
                        visits, e.g. The <gloss target="#t_IMET_1">IMET</gloss> program with a
                        couple of officers going to school in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_DN_1">DN</gloss>: Do we have money for that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_McG_1">McG</gloss>: We might find $30–40,000 a piece for
                        that. We could also consider supplying some non-lethal equipment down the
                        line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_WH_1">WH</gloss>: We should think about the fact that
                        these people are training the Ogadenis before we go very far with <gloss
                            target="#t_IMET_1">IMET</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_McG_1">McG</gloss>: That would affect what school you
                        would want to send them to.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: There is a long-term political benefit
                        in training in this country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_JW_1">JW</gloss>: I support what <persName
                            corresp="#p_MDE_1">Dave McGiffert</persName> has already said—we should
                        increase symbolic support without a commitment on a long-term basis, but I
                        am not sure what we should say about the survey team.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CV_1">CV</gloss>: We simply say we are deferring it
                        without date—the circumstances are not such that it is appropriate for us to
                        send a team now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ST_1">ST</gloss>: I agree with the same options as the
                        rest of you. The Saudis approached me some time ago about communications
                        support for Somalia and I would like to leave the thought with the group
                        that when we are ready to proceed with something, we consider helping them
                        build a military communications network. This is rather non-lethal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CV_1">CV</gloss>: We can note that without having to do
                        anything about it at this point.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sanders</persName>: We support Option 6.</p>

                        billion-dollar program—is not exactly desirable. We need to control these

                    <p>In response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s August
                        4, 1978 memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Not found.</note> I am
                        forwarding the preliminary feasibility study on a civic aid program for
                        Somalia which the US Army Corps of Engineers (<gloss target="#t_CE_1"
                            >CE</gloss>) has prepared with <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s
                            assistance.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">Not found attached.</note> The
                        study does not include cost estimates nor specific details for various
                        proposed projects which you requested due to the unavailability of
                        sufficient information in Washington.</p>
                    <p>To define the scope and cost of each project, the <gloss target="#t_CE_1"
                            >CE</gloss> first must complete a survey of the terrain and of
                        construction logistics and materials available to Somalia. The survey would
                        require twelve personnel to remain in Somalia approximately one month. Since
                            <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has funded similar <gloss
                            target="#t_CE_1">CE</gloss> survey teams in the past, State is prepared
                        to request they fund this one.</p>
                    <p>Before we send a survey team to Somalia, however, I believe we should first
                        approach the Saudis to obtain their support in principle for the civic aid
                        program reiterating that it would be a trilateral concept using Saudi
                        financing and Corps management. If agreed, we would then discuss with them
                        financial arrangements for the particular projects. We should also indicate
                        to the Saudis that once the Corps has completed an in-country survey, which
                        we are prepared to finance, we will be able to provide more details,
                        including cost estimates, for the various projects. Corps personnel
                        currently assigned to the Saudi <gloss target="#t_CE_1">CE</gloss> program
                        most likely will be used to conduct the Somali survey. These arrangements
                        also should be discussed with the Saudis since salary costs of these people
                        are reimbursed by the Saudi Arabian government.</p>
                    <p>I therefore recommend that Department of State be authorized, in coordination
                        with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss>, to consult with appropriate Saudi
                        and Somali officials to determine if sufficient interest exists on their
                        part for the <pb n="254" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_254"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_CE_1">CE</gloss> to undertake a survey to be funded by
                            <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s office of reimbursable
                        development. The survey’s purpose would be to provide the Saudis, Somalis,
                        and us with the necessary cost estimates and other data upon which to make
                        judgments concerning projects that they and we might agree to pursue under
                        the proposed trilateral arrangement. It would not commit the Saudis to fund
                        any of the proposed trilateral projects.</p>
                    <p>I believe this program helps our relationship with Somalia and benefits it
                        economically. Additionally, sending a Corps of Engineers survey team to
                        Somalia would provide us with an alternative for the military survey team
                        which President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has requested.
                        Finally the Saudis, who would like us to be more responsive to Somalia’s
                        military needs, are likely to appreciate the significance that a US Army
                        Corps of Engineers presence might have in Somalia.</p>

                        estimates of what could be done at what cost can be made only if a survey
                        team of 12 people is sent to Somalia to spend a month looking into these

                        wanting to finance this effort. The proposal originated, as you may recall,

                        stronger signal than the military survey team to consider arms supply which

                    <p>Informally, the position I have got from State is that they feel
                        unenthusiastic about going to the Saudis now or sending a survey team out to
                        Somalia, as <persName corresp="#p_MDE_1">McGiffert</persName> proposes. They
                        would like to defer the whole business while finding other gestures to show
                        the Somalis we are still interested in them—e.g. sending <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWC_1">Bill Harrop</persName> and the commander of the
                        Navy’s Indian Ocean Task Force to be present at Somali Revolution Day
                        celebrations on 21 October; and perhaps accelerating our regular <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>Internally in Somalia, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s
                        position is gradually weakening as dissatisfaction with him grows among all
                        non-Marehan (<persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s tribe)
                        tribesmen. He has antagonized other tribes by trials and executions of the
                        April coup plotters and this process is not yet at an end. Somalis abroad,
                        as well as at home, seem, according to fragmentary intelligence reporting,
                        to be engaging in more active discussion of alternatives to <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>. There is no evidence of serious
                        Soviet involvement in this ferment or indication that any coalition of
                        elements likely to seize power from <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> would be pro-Soviet. Recently, there has even been talk
                        among a few Somali dissidents of the desirability of holding free elections
                        and returning to some form of democratic system.</p>

                    <p>There remains little justification for U.S. action to bolster <persName

                        could not easily be represented as a blow to U.S. interests and a successor
                        government might well be more genuinely pro-Western. It might, perhaps, be
                        more willing to enter eventually into a process of working out a <hi

                        an engineer survey team is, therefore, not one that carries itself along on
                        its own merits. Since the Saudis were lukewarm toward <persName

                    <p>So what do we do? I suggest we give ourselves time to look at this whole
                        business carefully (we have lost nothing during the entire past year by not
                        rushing to do anything about Somalia!) and take only two steps now:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The first part of the meeting was devoted to discussion of the present state
                        of affairs in the Horn. It was noted that the consequences of recent
                        Ethiopian gains in Eritrea are not yet clear, but <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss> estimates that even without shifting many troops from
                        Eritrea, <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> may soon dispose
                        of enough military strength (utilizing large numbers of men who are now
                        completing training) to step up the fight against Ogaden guerrillas.
                        Somali-supported guerrilla forces have expanded. Cubans remain concentrated
                        in the northern Ogaden. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> faces
                        dissidence at home but his position is not immediately threatened.
                        Discussion of the Soviet posture toward Somalia led to the conclusion that
                        both <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> and the Soviets might see
                        advantages in exploring some degree of rapprochement but that any sharp
                        change of course in the immediate future seemed unlikely. To the Chairman’s
                        question whether U.S. policy required readjustment, the group tended toward
                        the consensus that while radical new initiatives were not justified, efforts
                        to generate movement in certain areas were worth trying. Specifically,
                        during the second half of the meeting, the following steps were decided

                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> expelled the Russians in
                        November 1977, he permitted a modest Soviet Embassy to remain in Mogadiscio
                        and the Soviets kept an ambassador, rather than permitting relations to sink
                        to chargé level. We took this to mean that both <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> and the Soviets wished to provide for the possibility
                        of warmer relations in the future. On several occasions during the past year
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has raised the specter of
                        Soviet plotting against him, alleging that pro-Soviet officers were aiming
                        to replace him and rejoin the Soviet camp and arguing that he would fall if
                        we didn’t give military aid. There has never been any independent
                        confirmation that such pro-Soviet plotters exist in Somalia, among officers
                        or civilians. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has kept
                        most of the men who were considered pro-Soviet before he broke relations in
                        office, notably Defense Minister Samantar. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> has maintained the system the Soviets helped him build
                        to control Somalia, based on a large security service and a mass “socialist”
                        party and it continues to serve him well. (C)</p>
                    <p>The intelligence community came to the conclusion several months ago that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> himself represented the
                        most likely source of a shift back toward the Soviets. Recent events tend to
                        confirm this judgment, for <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>
                        seems to have taken some initiative to explore this option. What we know
                        indicates the Soviets are not eager to have him back—for the time being, at
                        least. It could put a serious strain on their position in Ethiopia. (S)</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has steadily expanded
                        guerrilla operations in the Ogaden, now estimated to involve 50,000 men. The
                        Somali military system has been reoriented toward supporting them. His
                        continued pleas notwithstanding, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> is not badly off for arms and military supplies, having
                        been helped by the Egyptians and others with Saudi money. (S)</p>
                    <p>We have been able to supply economic and humanitarian assistance but the
                        continued Ogaden insurgency and <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                        >Siad</persName>’s inability to meet <pb n="260" facs="0295" xml:id="pg_260"
                        />Kenyan requirements for reassurance on borders makes it difficult for us
                        to do more for Somalia without paying a heavy price with other African
                        countries, from whom <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has
                        remained totally alienated. There are human rights problems, too, for
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has more people in jail now
                        than he had before he broke with the Soviets; he executed a group of
                        military plotters a few weeks ago and he has oppressed rival tribesmen in
                        the military and among civil leaders. The human rights situation in Somalia
                        contrasts strikingly with that in Kenya, where the 16 remaining detainees
                        have just been released by President Moi. (C)</p>
                    <p>In short, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has made himself
                        difficult to help and a problem for the countries who would like to be
                        Somalia’s friends. We are taking a new look at what we might do now to get a
                        little movement into this situation, but it is not easy. We do not think a
                        move back to the Soviets is imminent. (C)</p>

                        meeting was that it is desirable to utilize facilities at Djibouti to

                            xml:id="pg_261"/>but not to provide Djibouti with military aid as a
                        quid-pro-quo and to keep the French out front as the power primarily
                        responsible for Djibouti’s security. If we use Djibouti we have no urgent
                        requirement for use of Somali facilities. The group agreed that for the
                        immediate future we should avoid the kind of political entanglement with
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> that any substantial or
                        continuing use of Somali facilities would entail. Using Mombasa, which
                        incurs no political liability, along with Djibouti provides the support we
                        need. (S)</p>
                    <p>The meeting reviewed our relationship and internal conditions in each Horn

                        actions are necessary in the immediate future. State is trying to reallocate
                        additional economic aid from FY79 funds for Egypt which have not been
                        expended. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDC_1">Bergus</persName> and

                        further look, after talks with them, at how things are going in Khartoum.
                        The consensus of the intelligence community was that political trends in
                        Sudan, while not as positive as we would like, do not give cause for

                        Kenyan-Somali tensions have eased slightly. Kenya is being cooperative about

                        changing. There was some disagreement about the level of activity in the
                        Ogaden with the intelligence representatives maintaining that <persName

                        the guerrillas are largely cosmetic and reveal no decision to stop

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CFL_1">Chapin</persName> noted that the
                        Ethiopian government is now permitting diplomatic travel, in groups, to
                        Harar and Diredawa and appears to have made real gains in reasserting
                        control in Bale and Sidama, where <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> has recently spent three weeks. But Ethiopians are
                        still convinced of <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s desire to
                        maintain Ogaden insurgency and will react very negatively to any indications
                        of increased U.S. willingness to consider military support for Somalia.

                        when we are convinced that they are real. I was surprised that none of the
                        military representatives at this meeting argued for naval facilities in
                        Somalia or for a closer U.S. military relationship. This enthusiasm seems to
                        be well under control in the Pentagon. (S)</p>

                        of improved internal security. He sees no serious political opposition to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> at the center. He
                        expects the Ethiopians to continue to move ahead in Eritrea. He sees the
                        Soviets consolidating their position in Ethiopia, increasingly inclined to
                        use the Ethiopians as the “Cubans of Africa” and willing to pay a
                        substantial economic price. He sees little prospect for improvement in our
                        relations and fears further deterioration. State and he are working out
                        plans for a further, last-ditch effort to save the aid program by espousal
                        of nationalization claims and resolution of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has produced an assessment on Djibouti
                        which I requested several weeks ago. It strikes me as sane and competent. It
                        provides no real justification for the assertion being made in State these
                        days that the level of our naval visits and utilization of Djibouti has
                        threatened to destabilize the situation there. It does discuss in some
                        detail what is already well known: that Djibouti is a very fragile polity
                        whose relative stability depends on continued French presence. There is no
                        evidence that the French plan to leave soon. It also emphasizes that the
                        Ethiopians, with Cuban and Soviet backing, possess the capability of a
                        fairly high degree of harassment of Djibouti if they wish. The conclusion:
                        if we are going to continue to use Djibouti (and there are good reasons for
                        doing this), we need to be frank with the French about our need for their
                        alertness and support there and we have to warn the Soviets that we will not
                        tolerate Ethiopian harassment or destabilization effort—we will retaliate in
                        other ways.</p>

                        <p>The French role and military presence in Djibouti is a major factor
                            promoting stability, particularly as a deterrent to direct attack by
                            Ethiopia or Somalia.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the strategic importance of Djibouti for their naval
                            operations in the Indian Ocean, the French view their presence as:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—An obstacle to Soviet expansion in the Horn of Africa.</p>
                            <p>—A beachhead for safeguarding Western interests in the area.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>We know of no plans for a French withdrawal within the next year, and
                            present indications are that the French commitment probably will extend
                            beyond 1980. However, because of past differences between French
                            political and military leaders over policy toward Djibouti, it is
                            difficult to assess confidently the firmness of French determination to
                            stay the course in Djibouti.</p>
                        <p>The French have a military agreement—of uncertain duration—to defend
                            Djibouti against external attack, but responsibility for internal <pb
                                n="265" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_265"/>security rests officially with
                            the Djiboutians. Despite French training and advisory assistance,
                            Djiboutian security forces remain woefully inadequate and would be
                            unable to control major violence between rival Afar and Issa terrorist
                            groups. If France were confronted with a drastically deteriorating
                            internal security situation and the prospect of heavy casualties, it
                            would almost certainly face negative reactions at home and could well be
                            forced to withdraw its forces.</p>
                        <p>Paris believes that external aggression against Djibouti is unlikely as
                            long as a French military presence is maintained there. If, however,
                            either Ethiopia or Somalia were to attack, the French would most likely
                            make good on their commitment to defend Djibouti, but they would try to
                            avoid a long-term combat role by seeking a negotiated end to the
                            conflict. If a political settlement proved unattainable, the French
                            would probably attempt to initiate a phased withdrawal of their troops,
                            dependents, and civilians from the area.</p>
                        <p>Because of its history and location, Djibouti has attracted considerable
                            attention from its neighbors and their friends:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Ethiopia’s interest stems largely from its fear that Somalia might
                                annex Djibouti and take control of the railway terminus and port
                                through which an important part of Ethiopia’s trade historically has
                                passed.</p>
                            <p>—Somalis have long included a significant part of Djibouti in their
                                irredentist ambitions and share an ethnic affinity with the Issas
                                who now dominate the political scene there. Mogadishu also harbors
                                suspicions about Addis Ababa’s intentions toward Djibouti.</p>
                            <p>—The Soviets look upon Djibouti in the context of their regional
                                policies and, consequently, support Ethiopian policy and objectives
                                there. Over the long term, Moscow hopes to see the emergence of a
                                Djiboutian regime that will support Soviet interests and deny naval
                                and air facilities to the West.</p>
                            <p>—The Arab states see Djibouti as a relatively malleable pawn in
                                intra-Arab contention, and use economic assistance as a lever to
                                influence Djibouti’s foreign policy.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>There are enough uncertainties in the Djibouti equation to make
                            projection of events beyond the next 12 to 18 months or so hazardous.
                            Nevertheless, we believe that:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Tribal rivalries and contention for power by disgruntled Afar
                                militants could lead to the unraveling of the regime, and a series
                                of minor incidents or the incapacitation of President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> could lead to tribal strife
                                that would encourage intervention by either Ethiopia or Somalia.</p>
                            <p>—However, as long as the French remain on the scene, we do not expect
                                major escalation of external support for Djiboutian factions that
                                would increase tribal strife and lead to direct military
                                intervention.</p>
                            <p>—In the event of a French withdrawal, the way would be clear for a
                                major escalation of subversive activity by Ethiopia and Somalia, <pb
                                    n="266" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_266"/>working through their
                                sympathizers in Djibouti, probably touching off direct military
                                intervention by Ethiopian and Somali troops.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>There has been no significant reaction thus far to the US Navy’s use of
                            Djibouti’s port and aviation facilities for refueling, bunkering, and
                            crew rest. If the Navy continues its present relatively high level of
                            usage of Djibouti’s facilities—four to six ship visits and one P–3
                            aircraft visit per month—or only modestly increases that level,
                            reactions would probably continue to be generally muted. However, we
                            cannot rule out an effort by Ethiopia, the Soviet Union, or radical Arab
                            states to use US activity in Djibouti as a basis for more active
                            diplomatic maneuvering or harsher propaganda against Washington, should
                            this appear to be in their interests. Nor would we exclude the
                            possibility of a move by these states to make the US activity a pretext
                            for encouraging stepped-up Afar insurgent operations against the
                                <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> regime. The Ethiopians
                            already have sufficient guerrilla and political action assets to
                            escalate subversive activities with little or no warning.</p>
                        <p>The US Navy does not at present contemplate seeking permanent basing
                            rights in Djibouti, nor does it plan to lease Djiboutian facilities or
                            to construct facilities for its exclusive use. But, if it should
                            eventually opt for a significant quantitative—as opposed to
                            qualitative—increase in its use of Djiboutian facilities, we would
                            expect reactions along the following lines:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—The Djiboutians would expect increased economic assistance and,
                                perhaps, the provision of military supplies.</p>
                            <p>—While the French have welcomed recent increased US use of Djibouti,
                                they might become apprehensive that a significant increase in usage
                                levels could destabilize the internal situation and invite foreign
                                military intervention.</p>
                            <p>—The Ethiopians would condemn such a move as a US-Somali effort to
                                subvert Djibouti and as a plot by the United States and moderate
                                Arabs to undermine the Ethiopian revolution; Addis Ababa could well
                                respond by encouraging increased guerrilla activity in Djibouti by
                                Afar militants.</p>
                            <p>—The Somalis would welcome the move as a deterrent to Ethiopian
                                military action against either Djibouti or Somalia and Soviet-Cuban
                                adventurism in the region.</p>
                            <p>—The Kenyans would probably not oppose an increased US presence as
                                long as it did not arouse serious Ethiopian concerns or threaten to
                                generate all-out war in the Horn.</p>
                            <p>—The Soviets would condemn the move as an effort by the United States
                                to turn Djibouti into a US naval facility like Diego Garcia, and
                                they would try to convince <persName corresp="#p_GH_1"
                                    >Gouled</persName> that US use of his facilities was
                                inconsistent with Djibouti’s professed neutrality and dangerous for
                                its continued stability. Moscow might react by increasing its own
                                force levels in the region and by seeking expanded use of military
                                facilities in South Yemen and Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>—The Cubans would be quick to mount a propaganda barrage against the
                                US activity and might react by prolonging the stay of <pb n="267"
                                    facs="0302" xml:id="pg_267"/>their forces in Ethiopia and by
                                increasing their military presence in South Yemen.</p>

                        <p>34. <hi rend="italic">Djibouti</hi>. If the US Navy were to seek sharply
                            increased use of Djiboutian facilities, the <persName corresp="#p_GH_1"
                                >Gouled</persName> regime, as a quid pro quo, might increase
                            pressure for the provision of military supplies from the United States.
                            At a minimum, they would expect a significant increase in economic
                            development assistance. Djiboutian leaders have already indicated that
                            they believe their government is benefiting insufficiently from
                            virtually unrestricted US access to their air and naval facilities.</p>
                        <p>35. <hi rend="italic">Ethiopia</hi>. The Ethiopians, who have complained
                            of “imperialist activities” in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, would
                            condemn any major expansion of US naval activities in Djibouti. Addis
                            Ababa would probably portray such a move as part of a US-Somali effort
                            to destabilize Djibouti to Somali advantage and to deny Ethiopia access
                            to the port of Djibouti. Traditionally fearful of Arab encirclement, the
                            Ethiopians might also label such a move as collusion among the
                            Americans, the Somalis, and the moderate Arabs to “undermine” the
                            Ethiopian revolution—an interpretation Addis Ababa has repeatedly placed
                            on Washington’s motives for bringing about the Egyptian-Israeli peace
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>36. <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> would probably
                            retaliate—at least for openers—by encouraging radical Afar militants to

                            over the past year or so to draw the United States into a military

                            military aid. On balance, however, he would welcome a greater US naval
                            presence in the area as:</p>

                            part to be more responsive to Somalia’s security needs. He would press
                            even harder for the establishment of an arms supply relationship and
                            would renew previous offers to make Somali bases available for US
                            use.</p>
                        <p>39. An upsurge in Ethiopian-sponsored guerrilla activity in Djibouti
                            designed to counter an increased US presence there would probably not
                            provoke a military reaction by Somalia unless it perceived such activity
                            to be aimed at <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName>’s overthrow
                            and the undermining of Mogadishu’s vital interests in Djibouti. In that
                            case, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> would almost
                            certainly encourage pro-Somali elements in the Djiboutian Army to move
                            against the Afars.</p>
                        <p>40. <hi rend="italic">Kenya</hi>. Nairobi allows the United States
                            limited access to its airfields and the port of Mombassa. The Kenyans
                            favor the present level of US naval activity in the region, viewing it
                            as a counter to Soviet, Cuban, and radical Arab maneuverings. They would
                            probably not oppose an increase in US use of Djiboutian facilities as
                            long as the expansion did not arouse serious Ethiopian concerns or
                            threaten to generate all-out war in the Horn. Nairobi probably fears
                            that the Ethiopians would react by undermining the <persName
                                corresp="#p_GH_1">Gouled</persName> regime and pressuring Kenya to
                            alter its pro-Western policy. Ethiopia and Kenya—despite their
                            ideological disparity—are united in a defense pact directed against
                            Somalia.</p>

                            Djiboutian facilities, they roundly criticized US naval deployments
                            during the Iranian and Yemeni crises, and have repeatedly warned of
                            plans by the United States to increase its military presence throughout
                            the region. If US naval ships began to use Djibouti on a significantly
                            increased basis, Moscow would probably carefully tailor its public
                            statements to place the burden of guilt on Washington. Djibouti—if
                            mentioned at all—would be portrayed as an unwitting dupe or helpless
                            victim of US “imperialism”; the French connection <pb n="269"

                            parties—to remind him that US use of his air and naval facilities was
                            inconsistent with Djibouti’s professed neutrality. If <persName

                        <p>43. Because of their traditional reluctance to use naval facilities
                            permanently occupied by a Western power (in this case, France), the
                            Soviets would be unlikely to request regular access to Djibouti for
                            their own naval forces, although they might attempt to establish the
                            right in principle to make occasional port calls. Moscow would be more
                            inclined to react to greater US use of Djibouti by increasing its
                            overall force levels in the region and, possibly, by seeking expanded
                            use of military facilities in South Yemen and Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>44. <hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi>. The Cubans would join the Soviets and
                            the Ethiopians in condemning any sharply increased US military presence
                            in Djibouti and might use it to justify a prolongation of the Cuban
                            military presence in Ethiopia or an expansion of that in South
                            Yemen.</p>
                        <p>45. <hi rend="italic">France</hi>. Although the French would probably
                            welcome further opportunities to share responsibilities in the region,
                            their reaction is difficult to predict with certainty. They might argue
                            that significantly increased and highly visible US naval activity in
                            Djibouti would upset the country’s fragile political balance, lead to
                            internal strife, and increase the danger of external intervention. The
                            French might also calculate that such a US military profile in Djibouti
                            would focus the spotlight on their own continued major presence, and
                            that this could generate an adverse reaction both at home and abroad.

                            oppose the basing of US aircraft there. Baghdad would be inclined to use
                            economic and political pressure to make its point with the Djiboutians.
                            The issue is, nevertheless, several steps removed from Iraq’s major
                            areas of concern—Arab politics and the peace process and developments in
                            Iran—and Baghdad might be too preoccupied to do more than protest

                            ambivalent toward a formal US presence in Djibouti because of the
                            conflicting pressures to which they would be subjected. The Saudis would
                            consider various factors:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—The purpose of the US move (is the United States creating a base?

                            the Saudis would have any major objection, although they probably would
                            not support it publicly. Because of the potential threat to Djibouti
                            from Ethiopia, and Pan-Arab pressures orchestrated by Iraq in the wake
                            of the Camp David accords, the Saudis would be sensitive to charges or
                            expectations that they supported a US move that could eventually
                            encourage a superpower confrontation in the Red Sea and Gulf of

                            and like-minded members of the Arab League (such as Iraq) would take
                            Djibouti to task in that forum, and Aden might also be more receptive to

                            the United States, with the Saudis, with the Iraqis, and especially with
                            South Yemen), would not be able to support the US move publicly, [<hi

                            Ethiopian activities in the region. It is questionable whether either
                            country—especially Sudan—would publicly argue in favor of substantially
                            increased US activity.</p>

                            military threat posed by South Yemen, plus the more general threat of
                            subversion, would look more favorably on the matter. Since the downfall
                            of the Shah of Iran, Sultan Qabus has turned increasingly to the United
                            States for help and advice in obtaining military supplies, and believes
                            that his country’s security depends increasingly on the United States.
                            Kuwait, which pursues a more independent foreign policy than the other
                            Gulf states, has strongly opposed any great-power presence in the Gulf,
                            but at the same time has sought US support for Gulf security without
                            indicating how this should be manifested. The Kuwaitis—feeling pressure
                            from Iraq and resident Palestinians—probably would condemn an American
                            presence in Djibouti as an escalation of the risk of superpower
                            confrontation in the region. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

                    </list>
                    <p>(S) As you will recall, we discussed this topic briefly at our luncheon on
                        August 3. Additionally, in my letter to the President on increased presence
                        in the Indian Ocean, I mentioned the need for cooperation with littoral
                        states and access to regional air and naval facilities to support these
                            operations.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">See <ref

                        Considering the concentration of Soviet naval activity in the Gulf of Aden,
                        we particularly desire to obtain landing rights in the Horn of Africa for
                        our P–3 maritime patrol aircraft. At present, we have such rights only in
                        Djibouti and, more distantly, in Seeb, Oman to facilitate our aerial
                        surveillance efforts in the Gulf of Aden area. Judging from past experience,
                        I believe it would be unwise to continue to depend as heavily as we have in
                        the past on Djibouti to support our increased presence.</p>
                    <p>(S) During the March–May deployments of CONSTELLATION and MIDWAY to the
                        Arabian Sea/Gulf of Aden region, a lack of available facilities elsewhere
                        forced us to increase our reliance on Djibouti for <pb n="272" facs="0307"
                            xml:id="pg_272"/>P–3 operations and ship visits. While the Government of
                        Djibouti was forthcoming, our increased usage of their facilities led to a
                        request for military assistance from President <persName corresp="#p_GH_1"
                            >Gouled</persName>—a request to which the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> could not, within existing policy, respond.</p>
                    <p>(S) In view of the above, I think it would be useful to explore the possible
                        use of other facilities, such as those at Berbera and Mogadiscio, Somalia,
                        to support our broader Indian Ocean strategy. The Somali government has, on
                        several occasions, encouraged us to increase our access to its facilities. A
                        moderate increase in our use of those facilities would enhance our
                        politico-military objectives in the area, reduce our reliance on Djibouti,
                        and contribute to our surge capability in the region.<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>(S) Accordingly, I have the following recommendations at this time:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>—Plan for US Navy ship visits to the port of Berbera, at the initial rate
                            of one visit per quarter (subject to weather conditions), and the
                            establishment of a limited bunkering arrangement with Somalia.</p>
                        <p>—Plan for access by P–3 aircraft to Berbera and Mogadiscio, at an initial
                            rate of one flight per month, subject to a technical assessment of the
                            support capabilities at those airfields. (Based on that assessment, some
                            airfield upgrading may be required to support additional usage.)</p>
                        <p>—Consider improvements to Berbera port. (As I mentioned in our 3 August
                            discussion, the USS DAVIS visit to Berbera in May indicated that
                            effective use of Berbera port would be dependent on some improvement of
                            the facilities, such as upgrading refueling capabilities, breakwater,
                            and navigational aids. Such improvement might be accomplished as a civil
                            development project, perhaps with <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            and/or Saudi funding.)</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>If you agree, I will issue instructions for the development of specific
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> proposals for additional ship
                        visits, a bunkering arrangement and the initiation of P–3 visits to Somalia,
                        and for the coordination of these proposals with the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>(S) I should note, however, the likelihood that such US requests for
                        increased access may well result in renewed requests for US military arms
                        from President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>. I am doubtful
                        that the Somalis will be willing to stop their support of the Ogaden
                        insurgents in order to qualify for such military assistance from the US. I
                        therefore suggest that the question of an appropriate substitute assistance
                        package be addressed urgently by State, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss>, with recommendations to be
                        submitted within thirty days for us to consider and perhaps to take up with
                        the President.</p>

                    <p>We believe we should initiate our program of making defensive weapons
                        available to Somalia by offering to sell two C–130’s, transportation and
                        engineering equipment and radar.</p>
                    <p>The most acute Somali military need at present is to replace Somalia’s aging
                        Soviet-provided military transport aircraft. They are very interested in the
                        C–130 and have approached the Saudi Government regarding financing. Two
                        C–130’s could be delivered relatively quickly. We propose to send a military
                        survey team to Somalia in the near future to pull together concrete
                        proposals for the sale of additional non-lethal equipment.</p>
                    <p>We will also move ahead with the proposed US Army Corps of Engineers
                        development projects in Somalia to be financed by the Saudis, including the
                        Merca port, (US $78 million) and Garoe-Bosaso road and port (US $238
                        million). <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has recently told our
                        Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Dick Moose</persName> that he
                        would like to go ahead with these projects and asked our assistance in
                        obtaining Saudi financing support.</p>
                    <p>Saudi cooperation is essential in financing both the C–130’s and Corps of
                        Engineers projects. We therefore need to take this matter up with the
                        Saudis.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                    <p>—That we immediately offer, subject to Saudi agreement to financing, the sale

                    <p>—That we send a military survey team to Somalia to put together a package of

                            corresp="#p_BH_1">Harold</persName>, and I decided that we should
                        proceed with the sale of engineering and nonlethal military items to Somalia
                        if the Saudis are willing to pay for them. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Cy</persName> subsequently forwarded a memorandum (Tab A)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d99fn2">See <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> which
                        recommends that you approve this proposal. (S)</p>
                    <p>Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy</persName> recommends (1) that
                        we offer to sell, subject to Saudi financing, two C–130 aircraft and two
                        Army Corps of Engineers development projects and (2) that we send a military
                        survey team to Somalia to determine what additional non-lethal items might
                        be offered. (S)</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy</persName>’s memorandum was written, he
                        did not yet have word of the Saudi decision not to finance F–5’s for the
                        Sudan. Both we and the Sudanese have long thought we had a reasonably firm
                        commitment from the Saudis for these aircraft, while the Saudis have never
                        really committed themselves to the Corps of Engineers project for
                            Somalia,<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">See <ref target="#d90">Documents
                                90</ref> and <ref target="#d91">91</ref>.</note> let alone to
                        military purchases. Thus, while I agree with <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Cy</persName> that we should proceed with this program, I believe that
                        we should talk further with the Saudis before making any offers to the
                        Somalis. Once we receive firmer assurances on financing, we can then offer
                        the items <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy</persName> mentions and consider
                        the dispatch of a survey team. (S)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">I recommend</hi>, therefore, that we proceed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy</persName>’s recommendations only to the
                        extent of discussing with the Saudis their willingness to finance these
                        purchases, and that we defer talking to the Somalis about these proposals
                        until we have a Saudi commitment.<note n="4" xml:id="d99fn4">

                        senior Cuban military officer met with Ethiopian Minister of Defense,
                        Brigadier General Tesfaye Gebre Kidan. During the discussion, the Cuban
                        officer informed General Tesfaye that the Cuban First Vice President of the
                        Councils of State and Ministers, General Raul Castro Ruz, was in favor of
                        withdrawing some Cuban troops from Ethiopia, but had decided to maintain
                        current levels as he believed the United States would gain base rights in
                        Berbera, Somalia. The senior Cuban officer stated that he would have agreed
                        to withdraw some Cuban troops from Ethiopia, but he too recommended that the
                        situation be studied further before any action was taken to withdraw Cuban
                        troops. (Field comment: Source was unable to identify the senior Cuban
                        officer but he believed the officer to be General Ochoa, commanding general
                        of all Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia.)</p>
                    <p>2. (Field comment: The same source said General Tesfaye made no response to
                        the troop decision announced by the senior Cuban officer.)</p>

                            (<gloss target="#t_WSLF_1">WSLF</gloss>) leaders at the Somali militia
                        training camp near Afgoi in mid-February 1980 and assured them that Somali
                        Government support to the <gloss target="#t_WSLF_1">WSLF</gloss> would not
                        be reduced even if Somalia signed a military agreement with the United
                        States. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> had become concerned by
                        reports in early February that <gloss target="#t_WSLF_1">WSLF</gloss>
                        leaders were worried that <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> might
                        reduce Somali Government support to the <gloss target="#t_WSLF_1"
                            >WSLF</gloss> once an agreement with the United States was signed.
                        According to these reports, <gloss target="#t_WSLF_1">WSLF</gloss> leaders
                        for the first time were discussing the possibility of negotiating with the
                        Ethiopians for autonomy rather than continuing the fight for full
                        independence. When <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> heard these
                        reports, he became very upset and ordered leading Somali officials from the
                        Ogadeni tribe, including Commandant of the Police, Brigadier General Adan
                        Abdi Duale, and Brigadier General Adan Abdullahi Nur, Commandant of the
                        Halane Political Indoctrination Institute for the Somali Revolutionary
                        Socialist Party, to arrange the meeting with <gloss target="#t_WSLF_1"
                            >WSLF</gloss> officials. The meeting was attended by over 100 <gloss

                        “Socialist”—giving full propaganda support to the Russians, carrying out
                        extreme measures, such as further nationalizations and collectivization of
                        agriculture. These measures are now provoking antipathy, resentment and

                        supported <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and his

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">economic situation has steadily deteriorated</hi> and
                        will go on gradually worsening. Shortages of many locally produced
                        commodities are developing. Coffee is rationed (in the country where it
                        originated!—and where it is still the major cash-earning export) and imports
                        of food and consumer goods have practically ceased. The Soviets have
                        consistently disappointed <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>’s
                        high hopes for increased economic aid. Most recently, they have turned down
                        his request for a secure petroleum supply at favorable prices. The high cost
                        of petroleum is hitting Ethiopia very hard, since the country has no oil
                        resources of its own. (C)</p>

                            >Mengistu</persName>’s Achilles’ heel. The rebels have regained
                        territory and imposed heavy costs on government forces during recent <pb
                            n="279" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_279"/>months. The rebel groups are no
                        closer to unification than ever and have recently expended considerable
                        energy fighting each other. Soviet efforts to try to bring about a mediated
                        settlement have produced no results. It is unclear what <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> may be aiming to do in his
                        current dickering with the Sudanese over a possible settlement; he may
                        simply be playing for time. It is doubtful whether the Eritreans could ever
                        feel enough confidence in anything <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> promised to enter into a settlement. Prospects,
                        therefore, are good that the Eritrean insurgency will continue indefinitely.
                        The longer it continues the greater a source of strain it is likely to
                        become for the Soviets and the Cubans. (C)</p>

                    <p>There is debate both within Ethiopia and outside as to <hi rend="italic"
                            >whether <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> has the
                            potential to become a Sadat</hi> and expel the Soviets, setting his
                        country on a new, constructive course. I am skeptical, inclined to believe
                        that <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> has burdened himself
                        with too many mistakes of judgment to be able to save himself: e.g., from
                        the beginning, his <pb n="281" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_281"/>genocidal
                        policies in Eritrea; now collectivization. But it would be a mistake to
                        write him off as hopeless until he proves that he is, or until history
                        sweeps him from the stage. A convincing case that he is merely a Soviet
                        puppet cannot really be made. (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">There is no reason to conclude that Ethiopia is hopelessly
                            locked in a permanent Soviet/Cuban grip</hi>—or that Ethiopians could
                        ever reconcile themselves to such a condition. The Soviet/Cuban
                        relationship, in fact, generates more tensions than Ethiopia has experienced
                        before in its long history—and provides no reliable formulas for solutions.
                        There is every reason to believe that Ethiopians will be responsive to
                        evidence of heightened Free World interest in their situation. The West
                        needs to maintain presence in, and communication with, Ethiopia. It is
                        important for the United States to take actions, steadily and cumulatively,
                        that will encourage Ethiopians to have greater confidence in themselves, to
                        pool their strength to find alternate leadership that can chart a credible
                        course into the future. It is also important for us to reassure potential
                        alternate leaders that support in various forms will be forthcoming from the
                        Free World as they work to disengage their country from its forced marriage
                        to Soviet socialism. (C)</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> proposed a $130,000 program with two
                        major features: (a) stepping up propaganda both outside and inside the
                        country to encourage strain between <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName> and his Soviet/Cuban supporters, and (b) developing
                        exploratory support for opponents of <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>, both individuals and organizations. The purpose of
                        the second part of the program is to assess the needs and likely
                        effectiveness of various groups and thus to judge which might be worth more
                        substantial support in the future. Support envisioned is primarily for
                        purposes of improved organization and communications; no arms support is
                        currently envisioned.</p>
                    <p>The propaganda portion of this program was strongly endorsed by all <gloss
                            target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> members. The program for supporting regime
                        opponents was endorsed by all except State, which recommended that contact
                        with regime opponents take place only outside Ethiopia and that it be
                        confined to gathering information. The <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>
                        said that Agency experience demonstrated that contact for
                        information-gathering alone is unproductive because regime opponents are
                        unwilling to risk supplying information without some promise of modest help
                        in furthering their efforts to generate pressures for change in Ethiopia.
                        Limiting contact to people outside Ethiopia is undesirable because the
                        individuals with the greatest potential as opponents of <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> were those still in Ethiopia,
                        some of them still in the Government. Finally State proposed that each step
                        in the process of contacting regime opponents be reported back for review by
                        the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>. Both the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1"
                            >DCI</gloss> and the Chairman considered such a procedure operationally
                        unworkable. It was noted that our Ambassador in Addis Ababa has fully
                        endorsed the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> program as submitted and,
                        in fact, favors a more ambitious effort.</p>
                    <p>A vote of the membership revealed full endorsement for the program for
                        support for regime opponents by all agencies except State, which maintained
                        its reservations. The Chairman stated he would recommend approval of the
                        program as submitted to the President.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then said he had heard that <hi rend="italic">State had decided
                            to withdraw our ambassador to Ethiopia</hi> and reduce relations to
                        charge level. There had been no coordination of this decision, which
                        reversed a basic policy action approved by the President two years ago. The
                        chairman <pb n="283" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_283"/>said it was <hi

                        for contact and as a symbol of our interest in Ethiopia. The State
                        Department representative said he was unaware of decisions on this matter
                        but would look into it immediately.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Komer said that it was becoming increasingly clear that our efforts to
                        secure facilities in Somalia entailed the <hi rend="italic">danger of
                            entanglement in the Ogaden War.</hi>

                        Before we let this happen, he proposed that we take a longer look at the
                        Horn and decide whether we did not perhaps want to adopt elimination or
                        transformation of the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName>

                    <p>2. At his request, I met with President <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> at Villa Somalia this morning (May 19). When he said he
                        had been expecting me to call him, I replied that I had been waiting for him
                        to call me. I said that on the basis of last week’s dinner meeting (reftel
                        A), I had understood either he or General Samantar would be presenting to me
                        the Somali Government’s latest negotiating position. He laughed and said he
                        had instructed Samantar and the others to meet with me and my staff so that
                        in an informal setting we could come to a clearer understanding of what
                        needed to be done to nail down an agreement. In addition, in Nice he had
                        told <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> to explain the Somali
                        position to Washington (reftel C).</p>
                    <p>3. He went on to say that the counterproposal had not, as we had interpreted,
                        laid down conditions. The economic and military assistance elements of the
                        counterproposal were intended merely to spell out to us Somalia’s
                            needs.<note n="6" xml:id="d105fn6">See <ref target="frus1977-80v18#d78">

                        had the Somalis intended to make it appear that the US would have to endorse
                        Somalia’s Ogaden policy. When I noted that their written document had
                        conveyed quite a different impression, he responded that for this reason he
                        had set up the dinner meeting to provide a way to dispel any
                        misunderstanding.</p>

                    <p>4. After I had mentioned the need for a decision on the agreement on use and
                        the construction proposals, he said that “in principle” the Somali
                        Government had no problem with these. The Somalis would, as they had
                        indicated, suggest some minor modifications to the agreement on use, but,
                        again, these and the construction proposal were “ok.” Nevertheless, he still
                        needed from us some greater sign that we wanted a true friendship with
                        Somalia. He said, “give me the possibility to win my antagonizers (sic) and
                        not to lose face with the party, the Parliament and the people.” He repeated
                        that he needed to be able to convince them that in coming to an agreement
                        with the United States he would be “bringing them a true friend.”</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> cited some difficulties that
                        agreement with the United States on the facilities would cause Somalia. He
                        said he had no doubt that Iraq would cut the supply of crude oil to his
                        country. The Soviets would press for repayment of the heavy debt Somalia
                        owes them. Moreover, “once we sign,” the Soviets would put added pressures
                        on Somalia.</p>
                    <p>6. In the face of these and other difficulties, he hoped that Washington
                        would be “more flexible” in its approach to cementing a friendship. Getting
                        down to specifics, he listed the following as suggestions (he emphasized
                        they were not conditions) as to what the US could do in this regard:</p>
                    <p>A) The US would undertake to provide adequate air defense for Somalia. He
                        said that what he needed was not a specific amount of money, but a clear
                        indication that we will provide him sufficient assistance to meet his most
                        pressing air defense needs.</p>
                    <p>B) The US should tell its European friends “to pass on to Somalia some ground
                        force defensive weapons.”</p>
                    <p>C) The US should convince “your Arab friends to act to solve Somalia’s
                        immediate balance of payments difficulties.”</p>
                    <p>D) In the event the Iraqis do cut off Somalia’s oil, the US “would convince
                        the Saudis to send US crude oil.”</p>
                    <p>7. He added: “Let us not stick on the $40 million, but be flexible to
                        overcome this impasse.” He then said that there was one further means by
                        which we would come to an understanding and sign an agreement. He said that
                        because of the past, and because of hostile propaganda, “Washington has all
                        the reason to doubt me.” He wanted to overcome this and to be able to
                        discuss the mutual interests of Somalia and the US face-to-face with US
                        leaders. To do this, “I really would like to go to the US and talk.”</p>
                    <p>8. Concluding, he repeated that he was making suggestions aimed at seeking a
                        way out of the “current impasse” between us. He said he accepted that what
                        we were offering was a beginning, and in fact <pb n="287" facs="0322"
                            xml:id="pg_287"/>what he wanted most from a long-term relationship with
                        the US was assistance in overcoming the “poverty of my people.” However, he
                        said that, in view of Somalia’s current serious security problems, he had to
                        ask us to give him the means to be able to explain to his people that a
                        close relationship with the US would indeed be highly beneficial to
                        Somalia.</p>
                    <p>9. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> made no mention of a
                        “security guarantee.” The dinner meeting, <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1"
                            >Addou</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BR_1"
                            >Bartholomew</persName>, and today’s meeting all produce a different
                        version of what the Somalis want from us. The ambiguity could lie in a
                        problem of cross-cultural communications (and with the Somalis this should
                        not be underestimated), in imprecision in <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName>’s own thoughts, in changes of mind, or in Somali
                        bargaining tactics. Yet in all of what they have told us, there is a
                        consistent thread: to <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, our
                        offer is not enough to meet his political needs, and he wants something of
                        more consequence to demonstrate to doubters in the army and the Central
                        Committee that agreement with the US will bring more advantages than
                        disadvantages to Somalia.</p>
                    <p>10. In this regard, from today’s and previous conversations, it is clear that
                        to <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> an invitation to visit the
                        US has a very high priority. He would view this as something which he could
                        show to Somalis as evidence of US friendship for Somalia. And of course it
                        would add lustre to his position as Somali leader.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> made no reference to the
                        aide memoire of which General Samantar spoke. To the contrary, he indicated
                        that he will be waiting for our response to what he told me today.</p>

                    <p>For the third time in the last three years, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> has unleashed a major military effort in Ethiopia using
                        Somali regular forces. The conflict which is now intensifying in both the
                        southern and northern sectors of the Ogaden has not yet reached the level of
                        the war of 1977 but it already exceeds the scope of the fighting of the fall
                        of 1978. (U)</p>
                    <p>There are reports of Somali plans to sabotage the Addis Ababa-Djibouti
                        railroad again. If this occurs, it will represent a dangerous threshold of
                        escalation because of the political and economic importance of the railroad
                        to Ethiopia. You will recall the cutting of the railroad marked a crucial
                        step on the way to full-scale hostilities in 1977. (S)</p>
                    <p>There has been a remarkable similarity in each of these three episodes of
                        Somali attack against Ethiopia. Long-developed preparations (probably at an
                        earlier stage encouraged by the Soviets) brought <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> to the point in the spring of 1977
                        where, in light of severe political deterioration in Ethiopia, he found the
                        temptation to invest regular Somali forces in a major attack irresistible.
                        The crucial decision seems to have been taken only, however, when the
                        Somalis concluded they had a good chance of securing American military aid.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AAA_1">Addou</persName> probably gave
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> an overly optimistic
                        interpretation of his June 17 meeting with President <persName

                        secured—but with no commitment from us—they escalated their assault on
                        Ethiopia to a full-scale war. It was a daring gamble and almost succeeded.

                    <p>In the <hi rend="italic">expectation</hi> that we would be sending a military
                        survey group to lay the groundwork for such a relationship, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> decided to rebuild the guerrilla
                        structure inside Ethiopia with a major investment of Somali regulars. This
                        led to renewed fighting on a scale sufficiently intense that sending a
                        military survey team could not be justified and plans for military aid were
                            shelved.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">See <ref target="#d82">Document

                    <p>We have seen a similar pattern over the last eight months. We started the
                        effort to secure facilities in Somalia which is currently continuing in face
                        of a significant level of continuing guerrilla activity in the Ogaden. The
                        level of direct Somali military preparation was rather low last fall,
                        however. Though we hoped (unrealistically) to persuade the Somalis to keep
                        it low and reduce the intensity of guerrilla activity further in return for
                        the prize of an American military relationship, <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> looked at it differently. Intensifying east-west
                        hostility encouraged his wishful thinking: this time, he apparently felt,
                        the Americans could be enticed into accepting Somali operations in the
                        Ogaden . . . (C)</p>
                    <p>So rather than a reduction in Ogaden operations, we have had a steady
                        expansion with more and more direct regular Somali military participation.
                        This has reached its natural culmination over the past ten days in serious
                        military engagements between regular Ethiopian and Somali forces, with both
                        sides now reinforcing the units already engaged. The prospect is for further
                        escalation, expanded Ethiopian air retaliation against Somali territory and
                        perhaps—there are obviously some on the Ethiopian side urging such
                        action—Ethiopian attacks into Somali territory. (C)</p>
                    <p>There is also a new ingredient in the present situation, one whose importance
                        is still difficult to assess. The “Somali Salvation Front” which for a long
                        time looked like nothing but an Ethiopian invention, appears to have some
                        potential for attracting disaffected elements in Somalia. Best evidence for
                        this is the increasing concern <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>
                        shows for it. There are other indications that his own political position is
                        weakening and that opposition to <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> in Somalia, partly perhaps as a result of the ferment
                        generated by the refugees, is growing. Some of this opposition has no
                        connection with Somali Salvation Front activity. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, by escalating the
                        confrontation with Ethiopia at this time, is taking a more daring gamble
                        than before. His own expectation must be that the potential U.S.
                        relationship is sufficently ensured to secure <pb n="290" facs="0325"
                            xml:id="pg_290"/>some degree of U.S. involvement in defending himself
                        against Ethiopian air attack, and then more substantial backing. We deceive
                        only ourselves if we prefer to believe <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1"
                            >Siad</persName> would not want full U.S. military support to defeat
                        Ethiopia if he could contrive to get it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> has already had considerable
                        success in gaining humanitarian support for the Ogaden refugees who
                        are—deplorable as their condition may be—largely the creation of his own
                        policy of pursuing the war in the Ogaden to the point where the very people
                        who are supposed to be the ultimate beneficiaries of it have had their home
                        ground rendered uninhabitable. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> may, of course, as he
                        periodically intimates to us, be consciously risking <hi rend="italic"
                            >Gotterdämmerung.</hi> If his own political base is eroding and he sees
                        no political future for himself within the framework of any policy that
                        would lead to peaceful resolution of the Ogaden conflict—he loses little by
                        gambling on bringing us in to back him. There has never been any evidence
                        that <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> would ever reconcile
                        himself more than temporarily to our desire to limit our involvement in the
                        Somali-Ethiopian struggle. (C)</p>
                    <p>This is our dilemma. Are our interest in Somalia and our interest in
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> identical? I have always
                        argued, as you know, that they should not be. There is more to Somalia than
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>. He is a good example of
                        the harm that can be done to a country by an authoritarian leader who sells
                        himself first to the Soviets and then to any other bidder and sacrifices the
                        real national interests of his country as his mistakes propel him deeper
                        into the whirlpool of events that outdistance his capacity to control them.
                        A third, unsuccessful attempt to wrest territory from Ethiopia by force
                        cannot—by any reasonable calculation one can make—end successfully for
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>. We cannot let ourselves be
                        drawn into it to the extent that would resolve the issue in favor of
                        Somalia. If the result is some degree of defeat for <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>, or prolonged heightened tension,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName>’s own position is likely to
                        be weakened fatally. Some group in Somalia is going to try to rid the
                        country of him. Do we want to find ourselves trying to prop up a discredited
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> whose own internal power
                        base is eroding? Do we want to take the opprobrium of letting <persName

                        with us? We may be closer to facing that unpleasant dilemma than we realize.

                    <p>I continue to be struck by the fact that the most ardent proponents of a U.S.
                        policy of “damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!” in respect to Somalia are
                        those who know the least about it and have not studied the lessons of the
                        recent history of the Horn. A serious assessment of our real strategic
                        interests in SW Asia and what we can do to improve our position at a
                        politically bearable cost must underscore the unwisdom of proceeding further
                        with <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> and the desirability of
                        positioning ourselves to cut potential losses from our current degree of

                        late. While the Somalis escalate the fighting in Ethiopia, our effort to
                        gain facilities there should be put on the shelf.<note n="5"

                    <p>(S) There are now large numbers of memoranda on this subject, but the facts
                        really haven’t changed:</p>
                    <p>1. In the long run, Ethiopia is strategically much more important than
                        Somalia; US involvement with Somalia (which to a degree, will be taken as
                        implicit support of Ogaden adventure) will lessen the chances of detaching
                        Ethiopia from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>/Cuba over time.</p>
                    <p>2. From our strategic point of view, the Somali facilities would be
                        militarily useful, but are certainly not vital. Denial of them to the
                        Soviets has no great significance strategically as long as the Soviets have
                        a position in Ethiopia and the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad</persName> is weak and unreliable.</p>
                    <p>4. Although the Egyptians keep pushing us to help Somalia, the health of our
                        relationship with Egypt is not particularly sensitive to whether we do so or
                        not.</p>
                    <p>5. We should not count on significant Egyptian military assistance in case of
                        an attack on Somalia, even if we were also involved in Somalia’s defense.
                        The Egyptian capability is limited and, despite brave words by Sadat, a
                        significant military expedition would be politically unpopular (à la
                        Yemen).</p>
                    <p>6. Berbera is particularly vulnerable. Successfully to counter an
                        Ethiopian/Cuban ground attack will certainly require ground combat troops
                        from outside. There is no obvious source for such troops except the US.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">An unknown hand wrote a question mark in the
                            margin and a notation that reads, “This judgment strikes me as wrong
                            based on my looking carefully at it a couple years ago. At any rate
                            there’s analysis to support either view. Yet [illegible].”</note>

                    <pb n="293" facs="0328" xml:id="pg_293"/>
                    <p>(S) All of this says to me that the US should not intervene militarily in
                        Somalia and that therefore we should avoid a facility relationship which
                        would, because our interests would be so directly involved, make it very
                        difficult for us not to intervene. Let’s limit ourselves to providing some
                        defensive equipment, if we have to. Even for that, I hold my nose. And, as
                        recommended, let’s have commissioned an in-depth study of the implications
                        of greater US involvement in Somalia.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of the FY81 program is to upgrade Somali facilities sufficiently
                        to support increased US presence in the region in <hi rend="italic"

                        Somali facilities will be able to support P–3 <gloss target="#t_ASW_1"
                            >ASW</gloss> flights, fleet logistics aircraft, and will have limited
                        storage for naval task forces. The FY81 program is an essential first step
                        in improving Somali facilities to support combat operations in major
                        contingencies, but it can be justified solely on the basis of its
                        improvements for peacetime forces as well. This may become an important
                        point because <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> is unsure how much it
                        wants to spend in FY82 and 83 in Somalia. The following is a summary of the

                        approved in April 1980. A Finding signed on 16 April 1980 authorized the
                        Agency, among other things, to contact and assess the willingness of
                        influential opponents of the regime to cooperate in an effort to reduce
                        Soviet influence in Ethiopia.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note> The first months of this
                        effort have provided indications that with financial and other support,
                        direction and encouragement, the disparate elements now comprising the
                        opposition could be molded into an instrument to influence the regime toward
                        a more moderate, nonaligned course. The program’s fundamental directive is
                        to influence the regime, not to overthrow it, although we believe that some
                        program assets may well become participants in a future government.</p>

                            of the present Ethiopian regime and encourage pro-Western attitudes in
                            Ethiopia.” This ongoing <pb n="298" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_298"/>covert
                            program has had some tactical successes in recent months, and there is
                            growing evidence that key Ethiopian officials are disenchanted with
                            their dependence on the Soviet Union for aid and advice. The aim of
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s program is to heighten this
                            disenchantment and to try to move <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                                >Mengistu</persName> toward closer relations with the United States
                            Government and other Western countries. The goals of this program do not

                            nor does the Agency seek to confront the current regime in any military

                        <p>Within this context, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> proposes to
                            expand its support to Ethiopian oppositionists to provide for dissident
                            activities and sentiment. Several anti-regime and secessionist groups
                            exist, but they are oriented toward maintaining military pressure on the
                            regime to achieve their own narrow goals, e.g., independence for Tigre
                            Province, for the Oromo tribe, for Eritrea Province. Opposition to the
                            regime is severely fragmented. Some opposition leaders are too Marxist,
                            others too ethnic, regional or royalist to attract a significant
                            following. Moreover, since most of the regime’s active opponents are
                            secessionists, the nationalist high ground has been yielded to the
                            regime, which acquires some measure of legitimacy as the sole force
                            working to prevent the fragmentation of the country. Ethiopians inside
                            and outside the country who oppose the regime <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                            secessionism have nowhere to turn and, as a result, the regime faces no
                            unified, credible opposition.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Operational Plan:</hi> We plan to establish a loose
                            grouping of exiled Ethiopians who are articulating selected moderate
                            programs which they will encourage the present government to adopt. This
                            is not intended as a mechanism to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                                >Mengistu</persName>, but instead is designed to encourage
                            moderation of the regime’s policies and the inclusion of more moderate
                            voices within the existing government. The collegium would be small (a
                            dozen principals and about 15 staff assistants) and handpicked to
                            include some prominent Ethiopians with proven competence and experience
                            in their fields (former cabinet ministers, diplomats, jurists,
                            professors, economists). The associates will meet infrequently in
                            Europe, and most of their work will be done as individuals where they
                            now reside in the U.K., U.S., Sweden and West Germany. All have been
                            contacted and have agreed to work on this project full time or part time
                            over the next two years. They are prepared to begin working immediately.

                        <p>Members of the group will develop programs to redirect Ethiopia’s

                            advisors and equipment; reorganize the labor union along more democratic
                            lines; relax restrictions on journalists and the clergy; and co-opt
                            certain secessionist leaders into supporting the concept of limited

                            of the 16 April 1980 Presidential Finding on Ethiopia, which in part
                            authorizes “contacting and supporting appropriate elements in the

                            in Ethiopia and abroad.” At the same time, it should be noted that the

                            of State that the proposal for a grouping of Ethiopian oppositionists
                            could be implemented on the understanding that the objective of the
                            program would be later clarified in this revised Memorandum of
                            Notification. The representatives agreed that the proposal was
                            consistent with the existing finding and represented an expansion of the
