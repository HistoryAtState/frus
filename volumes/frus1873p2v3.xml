                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In submitting the accompanying report of the
                        proceedings and results of the mixed commission under the twelfth article of
                        the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of May 8, 1871, I beg
                        to express my profound sense of obligation to yourself for the uniform
                        kindness and consideration I have experienced from you during the whole
                        existence of the commission.</p>
                    <p>The two years and more of my connection with the commission were years of
                        severe and unremitting labor. The nearly five hundred claims presented to
                        and passed on by the commission involved an immense range of investigation,
                        proofs, and arguments. The transactions out of which they grew extended
                        through four years of time, and involved not only inquiries into the whole
                        history of the late war in its operations on land, but also a large extent
                        of maritime operations, warlike and commercial, and extensive inquiries into
                        the transactions between the late so-called Confederate States and subjects
                        of the neutral nations of Europe.</p>
                    <p>The proofs on the part of the claimants and of the defence, respectively,
                        were sought through the archives of all the Departments of our own
                        Government, as well as those of the late confederate government in our
                        hands. Testimony of witnesses was taken on notice, and either on written
                        interrogatories or on oral examinations by counsel attending in person, in
                        almost every State and Territory of the United States, in all the British
                        provinces of North America, in Mexico, in several of the West India Islands,
                        in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and in Egypt. This testimony was taken,
                        in all the cases of British claims against the United States, either by
                        special counsel sent under my instructions from Washington, or by local
                        counsel employed in the vicinity where testimony was to be taken. In each of
                        these cases counsel acted under written instructions from myself, as full
                        and specific as a careful examination of each case could enable me to
                        give.</p>
                    <p>The few cases of American claims against Great Britain were managed in regard
                        to testimony and arguments, by the private counsel of the claimants, I
                        rendering only a general aid and supervision, but not assuming the
                        responsibility either of taking the proofs or preparing the arguments.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0060"/>
                    <p>But in the claims of British subjects against the United States, involving
                        about 90 per cent, in amount of the entire claims before the commission, the
                        sole control and responsibility rested upon me.</p>
                    <p>These claims involved about $96,000,000, ranging through an almost infinite
                        variety of facts and circumstances involved in the support of or defence
                        against the claims. The claim as presented by the claimant in his memorial
                        and proofs often gave the first and only information to the Government of
                        the existence even of the claim, and involved an inquiry into the facts of
                        the case through very circuitous and difficult channels. In such cases the
                        Government always stands at a great disadvantage as against private
                        claimants, who have full knowledge of all the circumstances of their own
                        claims, when actual and <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, and of the proofs
                        by which they may be established, and who, in the case of fraudulent,
                        simulated, or excessive claims, have facilities in the manufacture of
                        evidence often very difficult to be exposed or rebutted by the agents
                        charged with the defence of the Government, and acting through secondary
                        agents often at remote and almost inaccessible points.</p>
                    <p>In view of the number and amount of the claims presented, and the importance
                        of the questions to be determined, the time limited by the treaty for their
                        examination and decision was very short. Two years for the complete
                        examination, trial, and decision of all these cases, nine months of which
                        time was allowed (six absolutely, and three under limitation) for the
                        presentation of the claims by the claimant, constituted a shorter time than
                        should have been taken for the thorough and satisfactory examination of all
                        the cases.</p>
                    <p>The fact that in this scanty time the Government was enabled to make the
                        examination and trial of the cases as thorough as it was made, and to arrive
                        at results so satisfactory, is certainly a subject of congratulation, the
                        awards made by the commission against the United States amounting to only
                        about two per cent, of the claims presented to the commission against
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The entire expense of the commission incurred by the United States, including
                        compensation of commissioners and officers of the commission, of the agent
                        and counsel before the commission and his assistants and clerks, of counsel,
                        agents, commissioners, witnesses, &amp;c, in taking testimony, and also
                        printing and incidental expenses, has been about $300,000, of which amount
                        about $50,000 will be reimbursed by the deduction from the amount of the
                        awards, pursuant to article XVI of the treaty. All the memorials, evidence,
                        and arguments were printed for the use of the commission, the expense of
                        printing being borne jointly and equally by the two governments. The entire
                        printed matter thus submitted, and now collated and bound, makes up
                        seventy-four octavo volumes, averaging about 800 pages each.</p>
                    <p>In an early case before the commission, involving the question of the effect
                        of domicile within the United States upon subjects of Great Britain, by
                        paramount allegiance, domiciled within the United States, <pb n="5"
                            xml:id="pg_5" facs="0061"/>Hon. Ebenezer Rock wood Hoar, of
                        Massachusetts, was retained by the Government at my request as associate
                        counsel, and filed a very learned and valuable argument. In a few other
                        cases, not exceeding fifty in all, I was assisted in the preparation of
                        arguments by Gen. Benjamin S. Roberts and by Messrs. Edwin L. Stanton and A.
                        S. Worthington, of Washington, who:?e services were faithfully rendered and
                        were very valuable. With these exceptions the arguments in all the British
                        cases were prepared solely by myself.</p>
                    <p>In the taking of testimony a large number of counsel and agents were
                        employed, under my supervision, in the localities where testimony was taken
                        as above related. Among those who have rendered faithful and efficient
                        service in this way, I deem it not invidious to mention Messrs. Kortrecht,
                        Graft &amp; Scales, of Memphis, Tenn.; Messrs. M. A. Dooley and William G.
                        Hale, of New Orleans, La.; Franklin H. Churchill, esq., of New York City,-
                        Hon. D. H. Chamberlain, of Columbia, S. C; Marcus Doherty, esq., of
                        Montreal, P. Q., Canada; Hon. Andrew Sloan, of Savannah, Ga.; Horatio D.
                        Wood, esq., of Saint Louis, Mo.) Frederick C. Hale, esq., of Chicago, Ill.;
                        Messrs. Speed &amp; Buckner, of Louisville, Ky.; Messrs. Bradley &amp;
                        Peabody, of Nashville, Tenn.; and General H. B. Titus, of Washington, D.
                        C.</p>
                    <p>Thomas H. Dudley, esq., late consul of the United States, at Liverpool, and
                        Joseph NTunn, esq., United States vice consul-general at London, also
                        contributed largely, by their knowledge of the different cases, and their
                        diligence and assiduity in inquiry and report upon the claims, to the
                        successful defense of the United States against many of the prize cases.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, too, I should not fail to make mention of the diligence,
                        skill, and assiduity of Mr. Edward Hayes, my stenographic clerk, during the
                        whole period of my agency.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I cannot forbear the expression of my great satisfaction with
                        the working of the commission, its performance of its arduous duties, and
                        the result of its labors. The thanks of both governments will undoubtedly be
                        fully expressed to the individual commissioners.</p>
                    <p>My personal acknowledgments are especially due to his excellency Count Corti,
                        the presiding commissioner, for the marked and unfailing courtesy, kindness,
                        and consideration which I, in common with every other person connected with
                        the commission, received from him throughout the whole period of our
                        official intercourse. The wide knowledge of public law, the sterling good
                        sense and judgment in its application to the facts of individual cases, the
                        untiring labor bestowed in the investigation alike of facts and principles,
                        and the able, diligent, and conscientious application of his powers,
                        attainments, and labors to the examination and decision of the cases before
                        the commission, merit recognition and acknowledgment from the governments so
                        largely indebted to him for the satisfactory disposition of the numerous
                        vexed questions between <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0062"/>them submitted
                        to the arbitrament of himself and his colleagues, to an extent to which,
                        these expressions of mine do scant and feeble justice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Frazer, the commissioner named by the President of the United
                        States, by his ability, impartiality, urbanity, and diligence, fully
                        justified the wisdom of the President’s selection and the expectations of
                        those previously acquainted with his judicial abilities and career.</p>
                    <p>I beg, also, to express my profound appreciation of the diligence,
                        faithfulness, and ability exhibited by Mr. Howard, Her Majesty’s agent, and
                        by Mr. Carlisle, Her Majesty’s counsel, in the management of the cases
                        before the commission on behalf of the British government, and to
                        acknowledge my personal obligations to each of those gentlemen for their
                        unfailing courtesy and fairness.</p>

                            of State:</hi></p>
                    <p>The undersigned, agent of the United States before the commission upon the
                        claims of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty against the United States, and
                        of citizens of the United States against Great Britain, established by the
                        twelfth article of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of
                        8th May, 1871, respectfully submits the following report of the proceedings
                        and results of that commission:</p>
                    <p>Articles 12 to 17, inclusive, of the treaty above referred to, contain the
                        provisions establishing the commission and regulating its jurisdiction,
                        powers, and methods of proceeding. Those articles are found in the appendix
                        to this report, A.</p>
                    <p>The Honorable James Somerville Frazer, of the State of Indiana, formerly a
                        justice of the supreme court of that State, was named as commissioner by the
                        President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Right Honorable Russell Gurney, member of Parliament, member of Her
                        Majesty’s privy council, and recorder of London, was named as commissioner
                        by Her Britannic Majesty.</p>
                    <p>Count Louis Corti, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the
                        United States of His Majesty the King of Italy, was named as the third
                        commissioner by the President of the United States and Her Britannic Majesty
                        conjointly.</p>
                    <p>Robert Safford Hale, esq., of the State of New York, was named by the
                        President of the United States agent of the United States to attend the
                        commissioners, to present and support claims presented on behalf of his
                        Government, to answer claims made upon it, and to represent it generally in
                        all matters connected with the investigation and decision of such claims,
                        pursuant to the provisions of the thirteenth article of the treaty. Mr. Hale
                        acted also as counsel for the United States under the same article.</p>
                    <p>Henry Howard, esq., one of Her Britannic Majesty’s secretaries of legation at
                        Washington, was named by Her Majesty’s government as the agent of that
                        government for the like purposes, pursuant to the same article.</p>
                    <p>James Mandeville Carlisle, esq., of the city of Washington, U. S. A., was
                        employed as the counsel of Her Britannic Majesty’s government before the
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>The commissioners and agents and counsel above named continued in the
                        execution of their respective duties to the close of the commission.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0064"/>
                    <p>The commission first met and organized at Washington on the 26th day of
                        September, 1871, each of the commissioners making and subscribing the
                        “solemn declaration” provided by the twelfth article of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Count Corti was requested, by vote of the commission, to preside during its
                        deliberations, and continued to act as presiding commissioner during the
                        entire existence of the commission.</p>
                    <p>Thomas Campbell Cox, esq., of the District of Columbia, U. S. A., was duly
                        appointed by the commission as its secretary, and continued to act as such
                        to the close of the commission.</p>
                    <p>The commission, at an early session, adopted rules for the course of
                        proceedings before it, including the manner of presentation, prosecution,
                        and defense of claims, the taking of testimony, and the printing and
                        presentation of the evidence and arguments, a copy of which rules, with such
                        slight modifications as were from time to time afterward ad opted, is found
                        in the appendix, B.</p>
                    <p>Within the time limited by the treaty, nineteen claims were presented on the
                        part of citizens of the United States against Great Britain, aggregating,
                        exclusive of interest, a little less than $1,000,000. These claims, as will
                        be seen by the detailed report hereinafter given, were all disallowed by the
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>Within the same time were presented four hundred and seventy-eight claims of
                        subjects of Her Britannic Majesty against the United States, aggregating,
                        exclusive of interest, about $60,000,000, and, including interest for the
                        average time allowed by the commission, about $96,000,000. Of these claims,
                        one was dismissed by the commission on account of indecorous and improper
                        language used in the memorial, without prejudice to the filing of a new
                        memorial, which was subsequently filed; thirty were dismissed as not within
                        the jurisdiction of the commission; two hundred and fifty-eight were
                        disallowed on the merits; eight were withdrawn by Her Britannic Majesty’s
                        agent, by leave of the commission; and in one hundred and eighty-one, awards
                        were made in favor of the claimants respectively against the United States,
                        such awards aggregating $1,929,819.</p>
                    <p>The entire amount of the awards against the United States, including
                        interest, allowed by the commission was, therefore, as will be seen, a
                        trifle over two per cent, of the entire claims presented to the commission,
                        on behalf of British subjects, against the United States, including
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Of the claims of citizens of the United States against Great Britain, twelve
                        grew out of the Saint Albans raid, so called, and were for acts of plunder
                        alleged to have been committed by confederate soldiers in the town of Saint
                        Albans, Vt., in October, 1864; one was for a like raid of confederate
                        soldiers alleged to have been committed upon Lake Erie in September, 1864,
                        and for injuries to the American steamers Philo Parsons and Island Queen,
                        and the property of American citizens on board said steamers; four were for
                        damages by reason of the alleged <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0065"
                        />detention of vessels laden with saltpetre at Calcutta, in January and
                        February, 1862, under ordinances of the governor-general of India
                        prohibiting the exportation of saltpetre; one was for alleged injuries to
                        the property of the claimant on the island of San Juan, in Washington
                        Territory, U. S. A., in 1862 and 1864, by the alleged actor procurement of
                        the commander of the British forces on that island, during the joint
                        military occupation of the same by the United States and Great Britain,
                        under a convention between them for that purpose; and one was for a royalty
                        claimed to be due to the claimant from the British government by reason of
                        the adoption and use by that government of a certain invention of the
                        claimant, a citizen of the United States, for the improvement of
                        breech-loading fire-arms.</p>
                    <p>Of the four hundred and seventy-eight British claims presented, two hundred
                        and fifty-nine covered claims for property of British subjects alleged to
                        have been taken by the military, naval, or civil authorities of the United
                        States and appropriated to the use of the Government of those States; one
                        hundred and eighty-one covered claims for property of British subjects,
                        alleged to have been destroyed by the military and naval forces of the
                        United States; seven covered claims for property of British subjects alleged
                        to have been destroyed by the rebel or confederate forces carrying on war
                        against the United States; one hundred covered claims for damages by reason
                        of the alleged unlawful arrest and imprisonment of British subjects by the
                        authorities of the United States; seventy-seven covered claims for damages
                        by reason of the alleged unlawful capture and condemnation or detention of
                        British vessels, their cargoes, &amp;c, as prize of war by the naval forces
                        and civil authorities of the United States; three covered claims for damages
                        by reason of the alleged unlawful warning off of British vessels from the
                        coasts of the States in rebellion by the United States cruisers, in the
                        absence of any lawful blockade of the coasts and ports from which the
                        vessels were so warned; and thirty-four covered claims of miscellaneous
                        character.</p>
                    <p>Many of the memorials singly included claims coming under two or more of the
                        classes above named, a fact which explains the excess of the sum of the
                        different classes above named over the entire number of memorials filed.</p>
                    <p>A schedule of the American and British claims, respectively, in their order
                        as filed and numbered, showing the names of the claimants, the nature of
                        their respective claims, and the time and place where they arose, the
                        amounts claimed, and the final disposition of the same, will be found in the
                        appendix, C. This schedule is accompanied by alphabetical indexes, giving
                        separately the names of the citizens of the United States claimants against
                        Great Britain, and of the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty claimants
                        against the United States, with reference to the number designating the
                        claim of each person; and also by another alphabetical index referring to
                        the vessels in respect of which damages <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10"
                            facs="0066"/>were claimed, and the numbers of the cases in which such
                        claims were made.</p>
                    <p>The commission continued its sessions in the city of Washington from the day
                        of its first meeting, with adjournments from time to time, down to the 10th
                        day of May, 1873; on which day, under the authority of a supplemental
                        article to the treaty concluded between the two governments, and authorizing
                        the sessions of the commission elsewhere than in the city of Washington, it
                        adjourned to meet at Newport, in the State of Rhode Island, on the third day
                        of June following. On the last-named day it again met at Newport, and
                        continued its sessions without interruption, except by adjournments from day
                        to day, until the 25th day of September, 1873. On the last-named day, having
                        finally decided and disposed of every claim pending before it within the
                        time limited by the treaty, the commission made and signed in duplicate its
                        final award, signed by all the commissioners, a copy of which will be found
                        in the appendix, D.</p>
                    <p>Separate awards in duplicate were made and signed by the commissioners, in
                        respect of each claim finally passed upon by them, as the cases were
                        respectively disposed of.</p>
                    <p>The duplicate original final awards, as well as the duplicate original
                        individual awards in the case of each claimant, were delivered by the
                        commission, through its secretary, to the respective governments, together
                        with duplicate journals of the entire proceedings of the commission, kept by
                        the secretary and certified from day to day by the presiding
                        commissioner.</p>
                    <p>The entire number of cases, American and British, decided by the commission
                        (after deducting the eight claims withdrawn by Her Majesty’s agent) was four
                        hundred and eighty-nine. All the commissioners united in the awards in three
                        hundred and seventy-two cases; in ninety-seven cases the awards were signed
                        by Count Corti and Mr. Commissioner Gurney only, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                        dissenting; and in twenty cases the awards were signed by Count Corti and
                        Mr. Commissioner Frazer only, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                    <p>In the following pages I have attempted, to the best of my ability, to report
                        the various principal questions which arose before the commission, giving a
                        succinct statement of the allegations and proofs of the respective parties
                        upon such questions, the arguments by which the respective claims were
                        supported and opposed, the authorities cited by the respective counsel, and,
                        as far as practicable, the principles established by the respective
                        decisions of the commission. In but a very small proportion of the whole
                        number of cases decided were the grounds of the decision stated in the
                        record or by written opinions of the several commissioners. Wherever the
                        grounds of the decision appear in the record itself, I have carefully given
                        the language of the record.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer has kindly furnished me with copies of a few opinions
                        pronounced by him before the commission, some of them <pb n="11"
                            xml:id="pg_11" facs="0067"/>expressing the views of the commission, or a
                        majority of it, and others dissenting opinions in cages in which his views
                        were overruled by his associates upon the commission. I have deemed these
                        opinions of either class worthy of preservation, and have accordingly
                        inserted them either in the body of my report under the respective cases in
                        which they were delivered, or in the appendix. A very few written opinions
                        are understood to have been delivered by Count Corti and by Mr. Commissioner
                        Gurney, copies of which I regret that I have been unable to obtain for
                        publication with this report.</p>
                    <p>I proceed to consider the various principal questions which arose and were
                        disposed of before the commission in their order.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">i—jurisdiction as to the person.</hi></p>
                    <p>Various questions as to the jurisdiction of the commission, in respect both
                        of the persons entitled to a standing as claimants under the treaty and to
                        the subject-matter of the claims, arose and were disposed of in the course
                        of the proceedings. These questions, so far as relates to the jurisdiction
                        of the commission as to the persons entitled to claim under the treaty, may
                        be summed up as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p>The question early arose in several cases as to the sense in
                                    which the respective expressions “citizens of the United States"
                                    and “subjects of Her Britannic Majesty” were used in the treaty.
                                    This question was raised by demurrer in several of the early
                                    cases, and was argued at length in the case of Anthony Barclay
                                        <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United States, No. 5.</p>
                                <p>This claim was brought for the alleged taking and destruction of
                                    and injuries to real and personal property of the claimant,
                                    situated near Savannah, by the army of General Sherman, in
                                    December, 1864. The memorial alleged the claimant to have been a
                                    native-born subject of Her Britannic Majesty, but to have been
                                    domiciled for many years prior to the year 1858 within the
                                    United States, a portion of that time as Her Majesty’s consul in
                                    the city of New York, and from that time forward to the end of
                                    the war a resident of Chatham County, Georgia.</p>
                                <p>A demurrer was interposed to the claim on the ground, among
                                    others, that “the claimant, having been at the time of the
                                    alleged acts domiciled and engaged in trade and business within
                                    the enemy’s country, cannot claim the position of a subject of
                                    Her Britannic Majesty within the twelfth article of the
                                    treaty.”</p>
                                <p>Under this demurrer, the counsel for the United States contended
                                    that, under the twelfth article of the treaty, the terms
                                    “citizens of the United States” and “subjects of Her Britannic
                                    Majesty” were to be taken not in their strict meaning, under
                                    municipal law, of absolute citizenship for all purposes, or of
                                    paramount allegiance to a sovereign, but in the larger sense
                                    recognized by international law, in which sense it was contended
                                    that all persons were included within those respective
                                    expressions who by permanent domicile were within the protection
                                    of <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0068"/>the government under
                                    which they resided, and who thereby owed to the country of their
                                    domicile that allegiance, perhaps temporary and qualified,
                                    exacted by such domicile. In other words, it was contended that
                                    within the terms of the treaty all persons permanently domiciled
                                    within the United States were to be taken as citizens of the
                                    United States, and all persons permanently domiciled within the
                                    jurisdiction of Great Britain were to be taken as subjects of
                                    Her Britannic Majesty.</p>

                                <p>The commission overruled the demurrer of the United States by the
                                    following decision, rendered on the 16th December, 1871, in
                                    which all the commissioners concurred: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>The first thing to be decided in this case is whether the
                                            commissioners have jurisdiction, which depends upon
                                            whether the claimant is, within the meaning of the
                                            treaty, a British subject.</p>
                                        <p>That he is in fact a British subject there is no doubt;
                                            but it is contended that, being domiciled in the United
                                            States, he is not one of those intended by the framers
                                            of the treaty to be included in that term. It is
                                            undoubtedly true, as appears from various cases cited in
                                            the argument, that the subject or citizen of one state
                                            domiciled in another acquires, in some respects,
                                            privileges, and incurs liabilities, distinct from those
                                            possessed in right of his original birth or citizenship.
                                            But he still remains the subject or citizen of the state
                                            to which he originally belonged, and we see no reason to
                                            suppose that it was the intention of either government
                                            to put the limited meaning on the words “British
                                            subject,” contended for in the arguments in support of
                                            the demurrer so as to exclude from our jurisdiction a
                                            British subject who has never renounced his original
                                            allegiance, or become naturalized in any other
                                            country.</p>
                                        <p>The fact of the claimant having his domicile in one of
                                            the Confederate States will, of course, have a material
                                            bearing on the point, also raised in the demurrer, as to
                                            the <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0070"/>liability of

                                            Federal Army. It is difficult to lay down a general rule
                                            applicable in all cases to the rights of an invading
                                            army, nor, in this particular case, is that
                                            necessary.</p>
                                        <p>The statements contained in the memorial are, for the
                                            purposes of this argument, to be assumed to be true. One
                                            of the statements in the memorial is, that part of the
                                            claimant’s property was taken possession of by the
                                            Federal Army without any military necessity,
                                            convenience, provocation, or inducement, and plundered,
                                            and that part was wantonly destroyed.</p>
                                        <p>Supposing this to be true, we are not prepared to say
                                            that some liability might not be established against the
                                            United States Government.</p>
                                        <p>The demurrer is, therefore, disallowed; but the United
                                            States Government will be at liberty, if they think fit,
                                            to take issue upon the facts alleged in the
                                            memorial.</p>

                                <p>In the case of James Crutchett <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The
                                    United States, No. 4, a claim for property taken and
                                    appropriated by the United States in the District of Columbia,
                                    the memorial showed the claimant at the time of the alleged
                                    injuries, and for many years previous, domiciled at
                                    Washington.</p>
                                <p>A demurrer was interposed specifying, among other grounds, that
                                    the claimant, being so domiciled within the United States, was
                                    not entitled to the standing of a British subject within the
                                    treaty.</p>
                                <p>The case was submitted on this point upon the authorities cited
                                    in Barclay’s case, as above noted, and the demurrer was
                                    overruled.</p>
                                <p>The decisions of the commission in these and other similar cases
                                    established the doctrine that, so far as relates to the question
                                    of jurisdiction, the national character of the party is to be
                                    determined by his paramount allegiance, where that is not
                                    double, irrespective of the fact of domicile.</p>

                                    States, No. 40, it appeared from the memorial, in addition to
                                    the fact of domicile within the insurrectionary States, that the
                                    claimant had taken the preliminary steps toward naturalization
                                    under the statutes of the United States, by filing his
                                    declaration on oath of his intention to become a citizen of the
                                    United States, and to renounce all allegiance to Her Britannic
                                    Majesty, the sovereign of his nativity.</p>
                                <p>The counsel for the United States on demurrer claimed that such
                                    oath, added to the fact of domicile, established the national
                                    character of the claimant as a citizen of the United States
                                    within international law, and barred him from any standing as a
                                    British subject under the treaty.</p>
                                <p>The demurrer was overruled.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Joseph Gribble <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The
                                    United States, No. 116, the proofs on the part of the defense
                                    showed that the claimant, who had filed his declaration of
                                    intention, under the naturalization act, before the presentation
                                    of his memorial, had subsequently, and pending his claim before
                                    the commission, completed his naturalization, and was at the
                                    time of the submission of his cause a citizen of the United
                                    States. His claim was disallowed on the merits; but the
                                    undersigned is advised that the commission was unanimous in the
                                    opinion that his naturalization had deprived him of a standing
                                    before the commission as a British subject.</p>

                                <p>In the case of John W. Sharpe <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The
                                    United States, No. 92, the claimant’s proofs showed that he had
                                    exercised rights of citizenship of the United States, by voting,
                                    prior to the presentation of his memorial.</p>
                                <p>The counsel for the United States contended, first, that such
                                    acts constituted an estoppel against the claim of the claimant
                                    to a standing as a British subject under the treaty; and,
                                    second, that if strictly and technically there was no estoppel,
                                    such acts were to be regarded as very strong evidence of the
                                    fact of naturalization, and sufficient to overcome the
                                    claimant’s own denial on oath of such naturalization.</p>
                                <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, Mr. Commissioner
                                    Frazer dissenting; and the objection on the part of the United
                                    States was thus overruled.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Robert Eakin <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United
                                    States, No. 118, the proofs showed that the claimant had, in
                                    1857, in the State of Mississippi, exercised acts of citizenship
                                    of the United States by holding an office, which, under the laws
                                    of Mississippi, could only lawfully be held by a citizen of the
                                    United States$ and that he had, in 1862, the State of
                                    Mississippi being then in rebellion against the United States,
                                    held a like office, which, by the then laws of Mississippi,
                                    could only be held by a citizen of the Confederate States.</p>
                                <p>The counsel for the United States contended that the claimant
                                    was, by each of these acts, debarred from a standing as a
                                    British subject.</p>
                                <p>The claim was disallowed without a separate and distinct decision
                                    of this question; but the undersigned is advised that a
                                    majority, at least, of the commission were of opinion that such
                                    holding of office under the rebel government was of itself a
                                    violation of neutrality, and debarred the claimant from a
                                    standing before the commission.</p>
                                <p>In the case of the executors of Robert S. C. A. Alexander <hi
                                        rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United States, No. 45, the
                                    memorial showed the claimants’ testator to have been born in the
                                    United States in 1819, but alleged him to have been the son of
                                    Robert Alexander, a native of Scotland, and a natural-born
                                    subject of the British Crown. It also alleged that the testator
                                    had always held and claimed himself to be a liege subject of the
                                    British Crown, and that he had always been so held and regarded
                                    by all others. That in his early youth he had returned to
                                    Scotland, and there for many years held office in the commission
                                    of the peace and other posts of trust under the British Crown.
                                    That during the war his residence was partly in Scotland and
                                    partly in Kentucky, he having died in Kentucky in December,
                                    1867. The claim was for the occupation of and injuries to lands
                                    and real estate of the testator in Kentucky by United States
                                    troops during the war.</p>
                                <p>On demurrer it was contended, on the part of the United States,
                                    that the claimants had no standing before the commission in the
                                    right of their testator as a British subject; that, although by
                                    the law of Great Britain he was a British subject, he was also
                                    by the laws of the United <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0072"
                                    />States a citizen of those States; and that, in such a case of
                                    double or conflicting allegiance, the claimant was not to be
                                    regarded as a subject of Great Britain within the meaning of the
                                    treaty.</p>
                                <p>The counsel for the United States cited the Revised Statutes of
                                    Kentucky, vol. 1, p. 238, c. 15, art. 1, sec. 1, as establishing
                                    the fact of citizenship under the law of Kentucky; and also
                                    Drummond’s case, 2 Knapp’s P. C. Rep., 295.</p>
                                <p>The commission held the claimants not entitled to a standing, and
                                    dismissed the case, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read a written opinion, as follows:
                                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>The testator was by British law a British subject, but he
                                            was also by the law of the United States an American
                                            citizen, by reason of his birth in Kentucky; and he was
                                            not capable of divesting himself of his American
                                            nationality by mere volition and residence from time to
                                            time in Scotland and holding office there.</p>
                                        <p>Being, then, a subject of both governments, was he a
                                            British subject within the meaning of the treaty? The
                                            practice of nations in such cases is believed to be by
                                            their sovereign to leave the person who has embarrassed
                                            himself by assuming a double allegiance to the
                                            protection which he may find provided for him by the
                                            municipal laws of that other sovereign to whom he thus
                                            also owes allegiance. To treat his grievances against
                                            that other sovereign as subjects of international
                                            concern, would be to claim a jurisdiction paramount to
                                            that of the other nation of which he is also a subject.
                                            Complications would inevitably result, for no government
                                            would recognize the right of another to interfere thus
                                            in behalf of one whom it regarded as a subject of its
                                            own. It has certainly not been the practice of the
                                            British government to interfere in such cases; and it is
                                            not easy to believe that either government meant to
                                            provide for them by this treaty. In Drummond’s case the
                                            terms of the treaty were quite as comprehensive as those
                                            of this treaty; and yet it was there held that the
                                            claimant was not within the treaty, not being within its
                                            intention. This was held even after it was ascertained
                                            that he was not a French subject, he having merely
                                            evinced his intention to regard himself as a French
                                            subject.</p>

                                    except that the memorial in effect alleged the claimant to have
                                    been born in Pennsylvania of native-born British subjects, never
                                    domiciled within the United States, but on a visit there at the
                                    time of his birth, and who returned to England within a few

                                    minority. He was domiciled in the United States at the time of
                                    the alleged injuries—the taking and destruction of his

                                    showed that the claimant was born in the British province of New
                                    Brunswick in 1813. His father, Daniel Scott, was born in the
                                    then province of Maine, in March, 1768, and continued to reside
                                    in Maine after the recognition of the independence of the

                                    The time of Daniel Scott’s removal to New Brunswick was left
                                    somewhat uncertain, ranging from December, 1789, to 1794.</p>
                                <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that Daniel

                                    the claimant, Joseph W. Scott, was by the naturalization laws of
                                    1802 (2 Stat, at L., 155, § 4) also a citizen of the United

                                    he was domiciled in the State of Florida, one of the

                                    peace between Great Britain and the United States, was entitled,

                                    that the decision proceeded upon the ground that Daniel Scott’a
                                    removal to New Brunswick constituted an election, within a
                                    reasonable time, to, adhere to his British allegiance.</p>

                                    held that the national character of a married woman is governed
                                    by that of her husband in all cases, irrespective of domicile;
                                    and that on the death of the husband the national character of
                                    the widow acquired by marriage remains unchanged. From this
                                    conclusion; Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissented, in the case of a
                                    widow of American origin who had always remained domiciled
                                    within the United States, holding that in such case, upon the
                                    death of her British husband, her original national character

                                    widow of a citizen of the United States, and domiciled in the
                                    insurrectionary State of Virginia, and before the filing of her
                                    memorial had again intermarried with a citizen of the United
                                    States, who was still living and there domiciled. Her claim was

                                <p>In the case of Mrs. Calderwood, No. 360, claimant was a
                                    native-born citizen of the United States, had intermarried with
                                    a British subject who was since deceased, and had always been
                                    domiciled in the State of Louisiana. The commission, on
                                    demurrer, held her a British subject, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                                    dissenting.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Mrs. Tooraen, No. 184, claimant was by birth a
                                    British subject, her husband at the time of marriage being a
                                    subject of Sweden, but naturalized as a citizen of the United
                                    States subsequent to the marriage. Claimant and her husband were
                                    both domiciled from the time of marriage within the United
                                    States., Her claim was unanimously dismissed.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Jane L. Brand, No. 180, which was a claim for
                                    alleged wrongful imprisonment and appropriation of the
                                    claimant’s property at New Orleans, it appeared that claimant, a
                                    native of Ireland, had been for several years domiciled in New
                                    Orleans. She there married in 1838 a citizen of the United
                                    States, who died in 1849, and she had since remained his widow
                                    and continued domiciled in New Orleans. Her memorial alleged
                                    that, though married to an American citizen, “she never in any
                                    manner adopted his nationality;” that after his death she
                                    uniformly claimed the character of a British subject; and that
                                    in August, 1862, before the commission of the acts complained
                                    of, or a part of them, she had made proof of her character as a
                                    British subject before the British consul at New Orleans, and
                                    been duly registered as such.</p>
                                <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that at the time of
                                    the claimant’s marriage and of the death of her husband, and up
                                    to the passage of the act of the United States Congress of 10th
                                    February, 1855, (10 Stat, at L., 604,) the claimant was not by
                                    the laws of the United States a citizen of those States, the act
                                    of 1855 being the first to give such status to an alien-born
                                    woman by her marriage to a citizen of the United States. That up
                                    to the conclusion of the naturalization convention of 13th May,
                                    1870, between the United States and Great Britain, (16 Stat, at
                                    L., 775,) and the supplemental convention of 23d February, 1871,
                                    between the same nations, (11 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 841,)
                                    no provision existed for the manner in which a British subject
                                    who had married a citizen of the United States should, upon
                                    becoming a widow, reclaim her original nationality. That the
                                    universal custom among nations, founded upon international
                                    comity, if not upon international law, allowed such widow to
                                    choose whether she would retain the nationality of her deceased
                                    husband or return to that of her birth. That Mrs. Brand, by
                                    always claiming, after her husband’s death, the condition of a
                                    British subject, and by registering herself as such in the
                                    consulate at New Orleans in 1862, had done all that was
                                    necessary to enable her to re-assume her original national
                                    character; and that it was not necessary for her to avail
                                    herself of the provisions of the conventions of 1870 and 1871 in
                                    order to <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0075"/>disclaim and
                                    repudiate any alleged condition of American citizenship acquired
                                    by her marriage.</p>

                                        >vs</hi>. Owen, (7 Wall., 496.)</p>
                                <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that, under the
                                    principles recognized by the commission in the cases of Mrs.
                                    Calderwood, No. 360, and others, it was settled that the
                                    national character of a married woman was in all cases
                                    determined by that of her husband; and that such national
                                    character, once acquired by marriage, continued on the death of
                                    the husband. That this doctrine had always prevailed in Great
                                    Britain, as well as elsewhere, where the domicile of the wife
                                    and widow had continued to be that of the husband’s nationality;
                                    and that by no treaty stipulation or law, municipal or
                                    international, was the widow ever allowed to reclaim her
                                    original nationality while still domiciled within the
                                    nationality of her husband, until the conventions of 1870 and
                                    1871; and that by those conventions she could only reclaim her
                                    original nationality in the form provided by the convention of

                                    she was, therefore, both at the time of the commission of the
                                    alleged wrongs and at the time of the presentation of her
                                    memorial, a citizen of the United States.</p>
                                <p>The commission unanimously sustained the doctrine maintained on
                                    behalf of the United States, and dismissed the claim for want of
                                    jurisdiction.</p></item>

                                    same, No. 291, and others, the question was raised as to the
                                    jurisdiction of the commission in the case of the personal
                                    representatives of British subjects who had died holding claims
                                    within the treaty against the United States, where such personal
                                    representatives were citizens of the United States.</p>
                                <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that under the
                                    treaty the claims against the United States of which the
                                    commission had jurisdiction must be not only those arising out
                                    of acts committed against the person or property of British
                                    subjects, but also must be prosecuted before the commission on
                                    behalf of British subjects; and that where the claim, though
                                    originally one of a British subject, had been transferred by act
                                    of the original claimant or by operation of law to citizens of
                                    the United States, such citizens could have no standing before
                                    the commission.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Mrs. Grayson, No. 291, the claim was prosecuted by
                                    her as administratrix of John J. Cowley, a deceased British
                                    subject. The claimant was the widow of Cowley, but had, before
                                    presenting her claim, intermarried with Grayson, a citizen of
                                    the United States. The distributees of Cowley’s estate were the
                                    widow and certain brothers and sisters, all British subjects and
                                    domiciled within the British dominions. An award was made in
                                    favor of the claimant for the one-half of <pb n="20"

                                    distributees were entitled, rejecting the one-half belonging to

                                <p>In the case of Halley and other cases submitted with it the
                                    following decision was entered: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>The majority of the commissioners are of opinion that,
                                            where the claim is by an administrator in respect of
                                            injuries to property of an intestate who was exclusively
                                            a British subject, and the beneficiaries are British
                                            subjects as well as American citizens, the claim may be
                                            prosecuted for their benefit. The commissioners are all
                                            of opinion that the particular nationality of the
                                            administrator does not affect the question.</p>
                                    </quote></p>
                                <p>From the first portion of this decision Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                                    dissented, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>By the very words of the treaty (Article 12) the claim
                                            must be, first, for an act done to the “person or
                                            property of” a British subject; second, it must be made
                                            “on the part of” a British subject. Distinctly, then,
                                            these two things must concur to give us jurisdiction.
                                            This is too plain to admit of controversy. The treaty is
                                            the language of both governments, and must be construed
                                            to effectuate not the intent of <hi rend="italic"
                                                >one</hi> only, but of <hi rend="italic">both</hi>.
                                            If any of its terms have one sense in Great Britain and
                                            another in the United States by reason of their
                                            respective laws, neither of these senses can fairly be
                                            taken; another, though limited, sense must be sought,
                                            common to both countries. There is such a restricted
                                            sense of the language employed here. In Alexander’s case
                                            I expressed myself on this branch of the present
                                            question. One born in the United States of British
                                            parents residing here would be protected by the United
                                            States as fully as any American against wrongs from
                                            other countries, Great Britain probably not excepted.
                                            And Great Britain would not, as against the United
                                            States, intervene in his behalf, though she would claim
                                            him as her subject, and hold him to accountability as
                                            such if found -bearing arms against her. And if born
                                            here of British parents during a temporary sojourn, but
                                            afterwards domiciled in England and never residing here,
                                            the United States would practically treat him as not an
                                            American, refusing to intervene in his behalf against
                                            any other government, though she, too, would hold him to
                                            accountability as a citizen if found in arms against
                                            her. And so of persons born in Great Britain of American
                                            parents. The treaty is the product of diplomacy,
                                            providing this international tribunal for the amicable
                                            settlement of claims concerning which each power could
                                            lawfully claim redress as it saw fit, not of claims for
                                            which it would have no right to claim redress.</p>
                                        <p>Alexander’s case was a little different. He had estates
                                            and a domicile in both countries; was born in the United
                                            States of British parents domiciled here, but claiming
                                            only British nationality. This would be an
                                            interpretation of the treaty which would maintain our
                                            jurisdiction in all cases in which the complaining
                                            government would, by international law, have been at
                                            liberty to demand redress. It would settle all such
                                            cases, and thus effectuate the purpose of the treaty
                                            which was to terminate our diplomatic differences. The
                                            principles above stated, it seems to me, apply quite as
                                            fully where the person beneficially interested in the
                                            claim made before us is of both nationalities as where
                                            the person originally injured, being also of both
                                            nationalities, is still living and makes claim. To
                                            entertain the claim in either case is to assume that
                                            each government has by the treaty recognized its
                                            responsibility to the other for injuries done to those
                                            who are by its laws its own citizens or subjects This
                                            construction, it seems to me, is utterly inadmissible. I
                                            cannot possibly bring myself to believe that either
                                            government intended any such thing.</p>

                        known as the Saint Albans raid, in October, 1864. No. 14 was a claim brought
                        by the administrator of Elinas J. Morrison, deceased, to recover damages for
                        the wrongful killing of said deceased by the rebels engaged in the same

                    <p>The allegations in all the memorials were substantially the same, and as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>That, shortly before the 19th of October, 1864, a large number of persons,

                        Canada, combined together within those provinces for the purpose of
                        committing acts of depredation, rapine, and war from said provinces as a
                        base of operations, and as a shelter for immediate retreat, against the

                        combinations so made, proceeded from Her Majesty’s province of Canada East
                        into the territory of the United States, and assembled at the village of
                        Saint Albans, in the State of Vermont, distant about twelve miles from the
                        border of said province. That, being so assembled, they took forcible and
                        armed possession of a part of said village; there seized and imprisoned
                        several citizens of the United States; fired shots at sundry citizens; by
                        such shooting killed the decedent named in No. 14; set fire to several
                        buildings in the village; entered three of the banks therein, seizing and
                        imprisoning the officers of such banks, and seized and appropriated the
                        securities and moneys from the safes of said banks, together with horses and
                        other property named in the several memorials. That all these acts were
                        committed underarms and with military uniform, equipage, and organization to
                        a greater or less extent. That after the perpetration of these acts the
                        perpetrators retreated in a body toward the province of Canada, and entered
                        that province, carrying with them the plundered property, and closely
                        pursued by the citizens of Saint Albans and vicinity, who organized for that
                        purpose, and would doubtless have captured the fugitive marauders but for
                        the asylum afforded them by Her Majesty’s province. That shortly after the
                        arrival of the retreating marauders within the province of Canada, several
                        of them were arrested by local magistrates in that province, and a part of
                        the plunder carried off by them was seized by such magistrates and retained
                        in their custody. That immediately thereafter requisition was made by the
                        Government of the United States upon Her Britannic Majesty’s government for
                        the surrender of said persons on the charges respectively of murder, assault
                        with intent to commitmurder, and robbery, committed within the jurisdiction
                        of the United States, such requisition being based on and conformable to the
                        terms of Article 10 of the treaty of 9th August, 1842, between the United
                        States and Great Britain. That the requisition was supported by full
                        evidence on the part of the United States of the commission by the persons
                        so charged of the acts of violence above named. That before the hearing
                        before such local magistrates of the charges preferred against such arrested
                        persons, Her Majesty’s government for said province caused the jurisdiction
                        of such local magistrates and the proceedings before them to be superseded
                        by one Charles J. Coursol, a judicial officer of the province, who took
                        jurisdiction of the matters charged, issued warrants for the arrest of the
                        persons so charged, and caused such persons to be removed from the jail at
                        St. John’s, Canada, where they were confined under process issued by the
                        local magistrates, to the city of Montreal; and also caused the property
                        seized to be transferred from the custody of the local magistrates to the
                        custody of Her Majesty’s officers in Montreal. That a partial hearing was
                        had before Judge Coursol, on which hearing full evidence was made of the
                        commission of such acts of violence by the persons so <pb n="23"
                            xml:id="pg_23" facs="0079"/>charged; and that the hearing was, on the
                        application of the persons charged, unreasonably, and against the protest of
                        the counsel for the United States, postponed from time to time to the 13th
                        December, 1864, for the purpose of enabling the respondents to make proof of
                        their being commissioned and authorized by the Confederate States of
                        America, so called, to commit the acts of violence named. That on the 13th
                        December Judge Coursol, without hearing any further proofs or arguments, in
                        a hasty, unjudicial, and indecent manner discharged from custody the persons
                        against whom such hearing had chiefly proceeded, and all other persons
                        arrested and held on the same charge, and immediately and with indecent
                        haste ordered the money and property of the claimants found upon the persons
                        so charged to be delivered up to them, and permitted them to make their
                        escape therewith, such money and propperty amounting to.$80,00.0 and
                        upwards, and having been fully proved and identified as the money and
                        property of the claimants, and as having been plundered and carried off by
                        the persons so charged and arrested and discharged. That subsequently
                        further warrants were issued by Judge Smith, one of Her Majesty’s justices
                        of the superior court for the said province, on which warrants, after much
                        delay and hindrance, arising from the friendliness of the constabulary of
                        the province to the confederate raiders and their pretended government, and
                        the unfriendliness of the same to the United States Government and its
                        people, in consequence whereof most of the offenders were allowed to escape,
                        and all the money and property was allowed to be secreted or removed, five
                        of the persons so charged were again arrested and brought before Justice
                        Smith upon an application of the United States for their extradition. That
                        after much delay Justice Smith decided that the persons were not the subject
                        of extradition under the treaty, but were belligerents against the United
                        States in committing the acts complained of, and in making their retreat to
                        Canada and enjoying its asylum, and discharged the prisoners. That by these
                        acts of the judicial officers of Canada, Her Majesty’s government, in
                        effect, refused to surrender the persons who committed these acts of
                        violence within the United States, and refused to restore to the United
                        States and to its citizens the property and money so taken and carried by
                        the plunderers into the province of Canada. That in the commission of these
                        acts, as well as in their organization and preparation for the same, these
                        raiders claimed to act under the authority and in aid of the so-called
                        Confederate States of America—the enemies of the United States—and that
                        their confederation and organization for the purpose of committing these
                        acts were well known to many of the government officials, local officers,
                        and citizens of the province of Canada before the occurrence of the acts
                        named at Saint Albans. That in consequence of the culpable negligence or
                        connivance of the authorities of the province, no steps were taken to
                        prevent the expedition, or to give any information to the United States
                        Government, or any of its officers, so as to enable them to protect
                        themselves <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0080"/>against such acts. That
                        both before and after the acts in question warm sympathy and hospitality
                        were extended to the offenders by a large number of the leading and
                        influential citizen of the province of Canada, and the acts themselves were
                        vindicated and approved by some of the official government newspaper organs
                        in the province; and that such sentiments prevailed there that magistrates
                        and peace officers in many instances refused search-warrants and the
                        necessary assistance to enforce the same; in consequence of which many of
                        the offenders were allowed to escape without arrest and carry with them the
                        plundered property. The memorials charged Her Majesty’s government and
                        official authorities in Canada to have been culpably negligent in permitting
                        the raid in question from their borders, and in permitting the returning
                        band, under fresh pursuit, to escape into Canada and obtain asylum therein,
                        and in refusing to surrender them, with their booty, to the United States,
                        and in neglecting and refusing, upon full notice and demand, to restore to
                        the United States or to the claimants the money and property of the
                        claimants so carried off by the raiders.</p>
                    <p>Proofs taken on the part of the claimants fully established the facts of the
                        depredations committed at Saint Albans, as alleged in the several memorials,
                        and that those depredations were committed by a body of men who came
                        separately or in small detachments from Canada in the guise of ordinary
                        travellers and without any open or apparent organization or military array.
                        That their first apparent action in an organized body or in unison commenced
                        at Saint Albans, on the 19th October, 1864, and continued less than an hour.
                        That immediately after the committing of the depredations charged in the
                        complaint they retreated in a body toward Canada; were closely pursued by
                        the citizens of Saint Albans and vicinity, who rallied for that purpose; and
                        that the pursuit was only abandoned upon the retreating party entering the
                        province of Canada. The party acted under the command of one Bennett H.
                        Young, a lieutenant in the army of the Confederate States, and all its
                        members were claimed to have been connected with the regular military
                        service of the confederates.</p>
                    <p>The arrest, examination, detention, discharge, re-arrest, and final discharge
                        of some of the party, substantially as alleged in the memorial’ were also
                        established by proofs on the part of the claimants. Testimony was taken on
                        both sides bearing upon the question of the knowledge by the authorities of
                        Canada of the intentions of the confederates to organize a raid from Canada
                        upon Saint Albans or other frontier towns of the United States, and as to
                        the conduct of those authorities in regard to taking any measures to prevent
                        or suppress such intended raid.</p>
                    <p>Among the witnesses examined on the part of the claimants to show such
                        knowledge by the Canadian authorities, and their failure to take proper
                        steps to prevent or suppress the raid, were Guillaume Lamothe chief of
                        police of the city of Montreal at the time of the raid, and Jacob Rynders, a
                        detective in the employ of the United States at Montreal at <pb n="25"
                            xml:id="pg_25" facs="0081"/>the same time. The evidence of these and
                        other witnesses tended to establish the fact that the raid upon Saint Albans
                        was arranged and organized in Canada; that the fact that that raid or
                        similar raids were in contemplation was known to high officers of the
                        Canadian government, among others to Sir George E. Cartier and Sir Etienne
                        Taché, then members of the Canadian ministry; to Col. William Ermatinger, a
                        stipendiary magistrate, having the entire control of the police force and
                        militia for the district of Montreal, embracing all the frontier towns in
                        Lower Canada bordering upon the United States; to Lamothe himself, chief of
                        police for the city of Montreal; and to Judge Coursol, government
                        superintendent of police for the city and district of Montreal.</p>
                    <p>The claimants also put in evidence the report of Frederick William Torrance,
                        esq., who was commissioned in January, 1865, by the Canadian government to
                        investigate and report upon the proceedings connected with the arrest,
                        examination, commitment, and discharge of the raiders, the seizure of the
                        moneys found upon them, and the circumstances connected with the giving up
                        of such moneys; also, whether there was any refusal to execute any warrant
                        for the re-arrest of the accused; if so, by whom and for what reason; and
                        generally to obtain authentic information of all matters and things
                        connected with such arrest, discharge, and re-arrest of the prisoners, and
                        the seizure, detention, and giving up of the moneys. In this report, made to
                        the Canadian government and dated 18th May, 1865, Mr. Torrance went fully
                        over the whole ground committed to his investigation, Messrs. Coursol and
                        Lamothe appearing before him and being permitted to cross-examine witnesses.
                        The report recited the facts found by him, including the transactions at
                        Saint Albans substantially as alleged in the memorials; the flight of the
                        raiders into Canada, closely pursued by the citizens of Vermont; the arrest
                        in Canada of several of the raiders by the local authorities in the district
                        bordering upon Vermont; the seizure upon the persons of those arrested and
                        in deposits where secreted by them of about $87,000 plundered from the
                        banks; the subsequent taking of jurisdiction of the cases of the persons
                        arrested by Judge Coursol, and the transfer of those persons to Montreal;
                        the examination of the prisoners, or some of them, before Judge Coursol, the
                        government of Canada, the United States, and the prisoners all being
                        represented upon such examination, and the same having been continued from
                        the 7th November to the 13th December, including an adjournment of several
                        weeks during that time to enable the defendants to make proof of their
                        relations to the government of the Confederate States, and to show that
                        their acts were those of lawful belligerents and not of private robbers.
                        That on the 13th December an objection was raised by the counsel for the
                        prisoners to the jurisdiction of Judge Coursol, which objection had some
                        days previously been made the subject of a private interview between Judge
                        Coursol and the counsel for the prisoners; and that thereupon the prisoners
                        were immediately discharged, and the money found upon them, <pb n="26"
                            xml:id="pg_26" facs="0082"/>to the amount of about $87,000, was
                        surrendered to them by the chief of police, under the private advice of
                        Judge Coursol, though without any judicial order to that effect. The report
                        of Mr. Torrance acquitted both Judge Coursol and Mr. Lamothe of the
                        imputation of being influenced by corrupt motives. It showed that after the
                        discharge of the prisoners by Judge Coursol, new complaints were made on
                        behalf of the claimants or their Government before Mr. Justice Smith, on
                        which warrants issued for the re-arrest, and that the execution of these
                        warrants was refused by Mr. Lamothe and one of his deputies. Under the
                        instructions of Sir George E. Cartier, and under the stimulus of a reward
                        offered by the government of Canada for the re-arrest of the prisoners, five
                        of them were shortly afterwards rearrested upon the warrants issued by
                        Justice Smith, and on examination were discharged by him, on the ground that
                        their acts at Saint Albans were belligerent acts and not crimes subjecting
                        them to extradition under the treaty between the United States and Great
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Torrance stated his conclusions upon the whole case to the following
                        effect:</p>
                    <p>That Mr. Lamothe, as chief of police, committed an improper act in the
                        surrender of the money to the prisoners without official directions from
                        Judge Coursol, as whose agent he held the money, so to deliver it. That the
                        oral and unofficial instruction of Judge Coursol to Mr. Lamothe to the
                        effect that the prisoners, if liberated, would be entitled to the possession
                        of the money, was not a sufficient justification to Lamothe for its
                        delivery, but was an improper instruction on the part of Judge Coursol, and
                        might have misled Lamothe.</p>
                    <p>That Judge Coursol, if his decision that he had no jurisdiction of the case
                        was a correct one, was in fault for having omitted to communicate with the
                        Government before announcing such decision and discharging the prisoners,
                        and had laid himself open to the imputation of a grave dereliction of duty
                        in a matter of national importance. And, on the other hand, if his decision
                        that he had no jurisdiction was erroneous, he was liable to a criminal
                        prosecution by indictment for malfeasance in his office by reason of the
                        discharge of the prisoners.</p>
                    <p>And, finally, that the government of Canada was responsible to the Government
                        of the United States for the acts of Judge Coursol and Mr. Lamothe, and was
                        under obligation to restore the booty brought into the province by the
                        belligerents.</p>
                    <p>Under this report the government of Canada subsequently refunded to the
                        claimants, to whom the same belonged, the sum of about $58,000, the gold
                        value of the $87,000 seized from the arrested raiders and subsequently
                        returned to them. This payment did not include anything on account of the
                        still larger sums plundered and carried off by the raiders, and which never
                        came to the hands of the Canadian authorities.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the defence various prominent officials of Canada were
                        examined, among them Viscount Monck, governor-general of Canada <pb n="27"
                            xml:id="pg_27" facs="0083"/>at the time of the raid; Sir John A.
                        McDonald, K. C. B., and Sir George E. Cartier, Bart., members of the
                        Canadian ministry at the same time, whose evidence tended to show the
                        absence of any such knowledge or information on their part, in regard to any
                        intended invasion of the United States from Canada, as to call upon them for
                        any precautionary acts beyond those actually taken by the government, and to
                        sustain the claim on the part of Her Majesty’s government, that the
                        provincial government of Canada were chargeable with no lack of due
                        diligence in failing to prevent the perpetration of the wrongs alleged by
                        raiders proceeding from Canada in the manner above detailed.</p>
                    <p>In argument it was maintained on the part of the claimants that the evidence
                        showed the raid to have been plotted and organized in Canada, under the
                        advice and direction of Messrs. C. C. Clay, jr., and Jacob Thompson,
                        confederate agents commorant in Canada. That the sympathies of the Canadian
                        people and the subordinate officials of the government were largely
                        favorable to the confederate cause and hostile to the Government of the
                        United States. That there was no neutrality law in force in Canada at the
                        time of the raid. That in the absence of such neutrality law and by reason
                        of the sympathies of the Canadian people and officials with the
                        confederates, the confederates were enabled to use Canada as a base of
                        operations—the scene of their plans and arrangements for warlike acts
                        against the United States, as their point of departure upon those raids, and
                        their asylum on their return from them. That supposing it conceded that Lord
                        Monck and all his ministry were without fault on their part personally, the
                        officers immediately charged with the maintaining of neutrality upon the
                        frontier—Coursol, Ermatinger, and Lamothe—were shown to have been fully
                        advised of the contemplated invasions, and to have failed of their duty in
                        reporting their knowledge to the government, if they did fail so to report
                        it, and in taking measures to prevent such invasions.</p>
                    <p>That the positions of Judge Coursol, as superintendent of police for the city
                        and district of Montreal, and of Colonel Ermatinger, the magistrate charged
                        with the entire control of the police force and the militia for the same
                        district, were such as to make notice to them, in fact notice to the
                        government, and that their failure in any respect to perform their official
                        duty was the failure of the government, and charged Great Britain with the
                        consequences of such neglect.</p>
                    <p>That the government of Canada was under obligation to constantly watch the
                        movements of these enemies of the United States thus plotting the invasion
                        of a friendly nation from the Canadian soil; should have arrested the
                        persons engaged in such plots, or should have expelled them from Canada;
                        and, if the law was found insufficient, should have called on Parliament to
                        make it sufficient. That it was the duty of the Canadian Parliament to have
                        provided by law the means of preventing such invasions; and that the absence
                        of such municipal law could not <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0084"/>be
                        pleaded in bar of the international liability of the government to perform
                        its duty in preserving neutrality towards the United States, a friendly
                        nation. That in fact the government of Canada actually did nothing to
                        prevent these violations of neutrality from their soil, though with abundant
                        reason, irrespective of proof of actual notice or knowledge, to apprehend
                        such invasions by the confederates commorant in Canada; and that the actual
                        notice of such intentions, brought home to Coursol, Ermatinger, and Lamothe,
                        was a notice to the government itself, which was chargeable with the
                        non-feasance or malfeasance of those officers. That the government of Canada
                        was held to “due diligence” to prevent military operations by the enemies of
                        the United States from the soil of Canada, as a base of operations, against
                        the United States. That the measure of this diligence was to be determined
                        by the nature of the danger to be apprehended from the neutral soil, the
                        magnitude of the danger and the results of negligence, the means of the
                        United States to resist or prevent it, the sympathy and aid which the
                        enemies of the United States might receive in Canada, and the unfriendliness
                        of the people of Canada to the United States, the fact of plans for former
                        raids known to the government of Canada, and the hostile speeches and avowed
                        intentions of the enemies of the United States, found in large numbers in
                        that province. That all these considerations combined to require strict
                        diligence on the part of the Canadian government to prevent hostile
                        incursions into the United States across the long and unprotected frontier
                        between those States and Canada.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the claimants insisted that the Canadian government had
                        entirely failed in the performance of these international duties, and that
                        by reason of such failure Great Britain was liable to the United-States for
                        the injuries inflicted by the raiders. That the United States had done all
                        in their power, and all which they were required by international law to do,
                        to protect themselves against such dangers from Canada; and that the
                        Government of those States had in their diplomatic correspondence preferred
                        such claims against the government of Her Britannic Majesty, and had fully
                        provided by the treaty for the submission of them to the decision of the
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the claimants cited the opinion of Count Sclopis upon the
                        question of due diligence in the tribunal at Geneva; also, on the same
                        subject, 1 Phill., 21, 230 to 232; 3 id., 201 to 237; Halleck, 318, 524.
                        They also cited various passages from the diplomatic correspondence between
                        the governments of the United States and Great Britain during the war, and
                        from the papers before the Geneva tribunal, as well as from the protocols to
                        the treaty of 8th of May, 1871, to show that the Government of the United
                        States had always claimed the British government responsible for the
                        injuries to their citizens by the St. Albans raid, and that these injuries
                        occupied a prominent place among the claims of citizens of the United States
                        against Great Britain <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0085"/>for acts
                        committed daring the war, for the purpose of passing upon which this
                        commission was instituted.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the defence it was maintained by Her Majesty’s counsel that
                        the proofs in the case showed no state of facts importing any lack of care
                        or diligence on the part of the authorities of Canada in the maintenance of
                        their international obligations. That the persons who committed the acts
                        complained of at Saint Albans did not enter the States from Canada in a
                        body, nor with any military array or equipment; that they passed over the
                        lines from Canada individually or in small parties, with the appearance and
                        in the manner of ordinary travellers; that the authorities of Canada had no
                        reason to suppose them engaged in a hostile expedition against the United
                        States, and that no grounds existed for their arrest or detention by those
                        authorities.; that there was nothing in their appearance or movements to
                        excite suspicion; that the Government of the United States had, in 1862,
                        voluntarily annulled its own passport regulations which had previous to that
                        time required all persons coming from Canada into the United States to be
                        provided with passports countersigned by the United States consul-general at
                        Montreal; and that from that time until after the Saint Albans raid there
                        was no regulation interfering with the free and ordinary passage of
                        travellers across the line. That the degree of diligence contended for by
                        the counsel for the claimants would have required of the Canadian
                        authorities a careful examination of every person travelling from Canada to
                        the States as to his character and objects, and would, in effect, have
                        abolished the free intercourse between the provinces and the States which
                        had existed under the full assent and approval of both governments. That
                        from the diplomatic correspondence between the two governments it appeared
                        that the United States had never preferred a claim of pecuniary liability
                        against Great Britain on account of this raid; but, on the contrary, the
                        American Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, had on different occasions
                        expressed his satisfaction with the action of the Canadian authorities, and
                        had particularly expressed through the British legation his thanks to Lord
                        Monck, the governor-general, for the assistance rendered by the Canadian
                        authorities toward the detection and arrest of the offenders. That in the
                        protocols to the treaty, in the four preliminary notes between Mr. Secretary
                        Fish and Sir Edward Thornton, on the subject of the formation of the Joint
                        High Commission which framed the treaty, and by the confidential memorandum
                        or brief sent by Secretary Fish to General Schenck of that commission for
                        the information and guidance of himself and colleagues, there was no
                        allusion to the Saint Albans raid, much less to any claims on the part of
                        the United States growing out of the acts committed or omitted by the
                        British government in relation thereto. That the only explanation that could
                        be given of this omission was that the Government of the United States did
                        not consider itself entitled to make any international demands in the
                        premises. That in fact the <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0086"/>proofs
                        failed to show that the raid was organized in Canada; that the raiders
                        procured arms or ammunition there, or did any other act within Her Majesty’s
                        dominions in violation of her just neutrality, which was known to, or with
                        due diligence might have been known to, the Canadian authorities. That, on
                        the contrary, the evidence strongly tended to show that the raid was in fact
                        organized within the United States, and that no act compromising British
                        neutrality was committed by the raiders. That no liability was shown by the
                        evidence, and none was claimed by the claimants’ counsel to exist against
                        Great Britain by reason of the omission alleged in the memorials of the
                        Canadian authorities to surrender the raiders under the extradition treaty.
                        That the acts of the raiders were belligerent acts, and as such afforded no
                        ground for extradition.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s counsel cited the opinion of Count Sclopis in the tribunal at
                        Geneva; also, 1 Phillimore, 230 to 232.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read an opinion, in which I am advised that the
                        majority of the commission concurred, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I may not be prepared to say that Great Britain used that diligence
                                to prevent hostile expeditions from Canada against the United States
                                which should be exercised by a neutral and friendly neighbor; but in
                                the view which I take of these claims this question is not
                                important, and need not, therefore, be decided.</p>
                            <p>The raid, upon Saint Albans was by a small body of men, who entered
                                that place from Canada without anything to indicate a hostile
                                purpose. They came not in an organized form, so as to attract
                                attention, but apparently as peaceable individuals travelling by
                                railroad and not in company, and stopped at the village hotels. That
                                there was a preconcerted hostile purpose is unquestionable, but this
                                was so quietly formed, as it could easily be, that even at this day
                                the evidence does not disclose the place, the time, nor the manner.
                                The Government of the United States was at the time diligent, by
                                means of its detectives, to know what mischievous expedition might
                                be organized by rebels in Canada, but it failed to discover this one
                                until after it had done its work. Such was the secrecy with which
                                this particular affair was planned, that I cannot say it escaped the
                                knowledge of Her Majesty’s officers in Canada because of any want of
                                diligence on their part which may possibly have existed. I think
                                rather it was because no care which one nation may reasonably
                                require of another in such cases would have been sufficient to
                                discover it. At least the evidence does not satisfy me
                                otherwise.</p>

                    <p>This case was, in general character, and in most of the circumstances
                        accompanying it, analogous to the cases growing out of the Saint Albans raid
                        above reported. The evidence on each side in the Saint Albans raid cases was
                        invoked into this case; and the case was argued, submitted, and decided in
                        connection with those cases.</p>
                    <p>The memorial alleged that some months prior to September, 1864, confederate
                        refugees, domiciled or commorant in the provinces of Canada, there planned
                        and organized a warlike enterprise of forcibly appropriating <pb n="31"
                            xml:id="pg_31" facs="0087"/>steamers of the United States on Lake Erie,
                        and using them for the capture of the United States war-steamer Michigan,
                        then stationed on Lake Erie. That by such capture, the plan contemplated the
                        release of some 3,000 confederate prisoners confined on Johnson’s Island, in
                        Lake Erie, near the American shore; and also to obtain control of the lakes
                        and power to destroy and pillage the cities of the United States bordering
                        thereon. That the existence of the plan for such expedition was known to the
                        Canadian authorities for many months before September, 1864, and that such
                        knowledge was communicated by the governor-general of Canada, in November,
                        1863, to Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, who communicated it to the
                        War Department of the United States, but that no steps were taken by Her
                        Majesty’s government for said provinces to prevent the execution of the
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>That on the 19th of September, 1864, about thirty confederate soldiers came
                        on board the steamer Philo Parsons, a private freight and passenger vessel
                        of the United States, at certain Canadian ports, with concealed weapons
                        shipped as freight, the vessel being then on her regular trip from Canadian
                        ports to Sandusky, Ohio. That immediately after the vessel had crossed the
                        boundary-line between the Canadian provinces and the States, this party rose
                        with arms upon the crew, took forcible and armed possession of the vessel,
                        making prisoners the officers and crew, threw overboard and destroyed a
                        large quantity of the cargo, seized the money of the claimant, an officer
                        and part owner of the vessel, shaped the course of the vessel for the
                        war-steamer Michi gan, and on their way overhauled, seized, and sunk in
                        American waters another private steamer of the United States, the Island
                        Queen, but, failing to receive expected signals, abandoned their project of
                        capturing the Michigan, raised the confederate flag upon the Philo Parsons,
                        changed her course, and proceeded toward Sandwich, in Canada. That on
                        arriving at Sandwich on the 20th of September, they plundered the Philo
                        Parsons while lying in British waters, landed their booty in the province of
                        Canada, sunk or partially sunk the steamer, and retreated in a body within
                        the province of Canada with the plundered property taken from the
                        vessel.</p>
                    <p>The memorial contained allegations similar to those contained in the
                        memorials in the Saint Albans cases as to the asylum afforded by Canada to
                        the retreating raiders; as to the negligence of the Canadian authorities in
                        failing to prevent the expedition, and also in failing to take proper steps
                        in apprehending the raiders and surrendering them under the extradition
                        treaty, and in restoring the property captured and carried off by them.</p>
                    <p>The claimant claimed himself the assignee of all the other owners and claimed
                        damages in the premises, $16,093.</p>
                    <p>The evidence in the case sustained the allegations in the memorial as to the
                        circumstances of the capture and destruction of the vessels <pb n="32"
                            xml:id="pg_32" facs="0088"/>named, and the seizure of the property
                        alleged, and as to the assignment of the claims of other owners to the
                        claimant.</p>
                    <p>Upon the question of due diligence by the Canadian authorities, the claim was
                        rested on both sides substantially on the evidence taken in the Saint Albans
                        cases, and the arguments of the respective counsel upon this question were
                        substantially those urged in the Saint Albans cases, with the additional
                        point, urged on behalf of the defence, that the Canadian government had
                        promptly given notice to the Government of the United States of the
                        information received by them as to the contemplated raid, thereby putting
                        the United States Government fully upon, its guard.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                    <p>The claimants in No. 11 were the owners of the American ship Daring; those in
                        No. 12, of the American ship Templar; those in No. 16, of the American bark
                        Patmos, and those in No. 18, of a portion of the cargo of the Daring,
                        consisting of linseed, saltpetre, jute, and gunny-bags.</p>
                    <p>The three vessels above named were, on the 27th December, 1861, in the port
                        of Calcutta, in British India. The Daring had at that date taken on board a
                        quantity of saltpetre, as part of her cargo, obtained a clearance therefor,
                        and had paid the export duty thereon. After that date she completed the
                        taking in of the remainder of her cargo, consisting of linseed, jute,
                        &amp;c., but including no saltpetre, and was completely laden on the 3d
                        January, 1862.</p>
                    <p>The Templar had her cargo all on board, including a quantity of saltpetre, on
                        the 27th December.</p>
                    <p>The Patmos also was fully laden, including 2,000 bags of saltpetre, on the
                        27th December.</p>
                    <p>On the 30th November, 1861, the following proclamation was issued by Her

                        the several ordinances prohibiting the exportation of saltpetre were

                    <p>The proclamation and ordinances in question were promulgated by occasion, and
                        in view of the arrest on the high seas of the British mail-steamer Trent,
                        and the taking from that vessel of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, agents and
                        emissaries of the confederate government, by a vessel of war of the United
                        States, and in the apprehension of probable hostilities between the United
                        States and Great Britian on account of such arrest and seizure.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that, irrespective of treaty
                        stipulations between the United States and Great Britain, the proclamation
                        and ordinances were in effect an embargo on saltpetre-laden vessels bound
                        for non-British ports, at least during the time it would take to unlade the
                        saltpetre; that it was a civil, as distinguished from a hostile, embargo,
                        not directed against vessels of the United States exclusively, but as a
                        husbanding of resources merely, though in anticipation of probable
                        hostilities, and thereby having some features of a hostile embargo; that
                        even in the case of a hostile embargo, if war does not ensue, innocent
                        sufferers have a just claim for indemnity, recognized by international law
                        and practice; that <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> there is always a just
                        claim for indemnity by sufferers in the case of a civil embargo; that the
                        fact that the embargo was justified by the municipal law of Great Britain
                        did not relieve that government from liability under international law; that
                        the action of the American commander in the arrest of the Trent, and the
                        seizure and removal of the two passengers named, were not justified by his
                        instructions, and were subsequently disavowed by his government, and
                        therefore no international wrong was ever committed by the United States;
                        and that, therefore, such action afforded no justification of measures by
                        the British government in anticipation of war, even if the measures in
                        question would have been justified by the emergency, if the acts of the
                        officer had been avowed by his government; that if the royal proclamation
                        and the ordinances were not to be considered as constituting an embargo, but
                        only a matter of domestic and police regulation, they certainly constituted
                        a violation of the rights of friendly foreigners, and involved liability for
                        compensation; and that, in the case of the Daring, the ordinance of the.
                        27th December having clearly given her the right to sail with the cargo
                        already loaded, this permission, with the subsequent <pb n="37"
                            xml:id="pg_37" facs="0093"/>acts done and expense incurred by her owners
                        on the faith thereof, in continuing to lade their cargo on top of the
                        saltpetre, in reliance on the ordinance, constituted a contract, and
                        entitled the vessel to the observance of that contract by the Indian
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>Under the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, the claimants
                        respectively contended that the right of the vessels in question to sail
                        with the saltpetre on board was guarantied by the terms of the treaty. That
                        “exportation" of saltpetre “from the said territories" was not “entirely
                        prohibited" by the terms of the ordinances, for such exportation was allowed
                        to England. That transportation from India to England was an “exportation
                        from the said territories," and was so recognized by the terms of the
                        proclamation itself, which recited, “it shall not be lawful for any person
                        to <hi rend="italic">export</hi> saltpetre from any part of Her Majesty’s
                        territories in India, except in a British vessel bound either to the port of
                        London or to the port of Liverpool." That the acts in question were plainly
                        not “in time of war between the British government and any state or power
                        whatever." That the language of the treaty providing “that in all that
                        regards this article, the citizens of the United States shall be subject in
                        all respects to the laws and regulations of the British government from time
                        to time established," could not be construed so as to authorize the local
                        authorities to deny rights expressly stipulated for in the treaty, and
                        formed no bar to the right of the claimants to sail with the saltpetre on
                        board their vessels, the same having been lawfully taken on board.</p>

                    <p>Her Majesty’s counsel maintained that both under international law,
                        irrespective of treaty stipulation, and under the treaty stipulations
                        between the United States and Great Britain, the proclamation and ordinances
                        in question were lawful and valid, and involved no liability for
                        compensation to parties injured by their provisions. That they were general
                        regulations, not directed against the ships or cargoes of these claimants in
                        particular, nor subjecting the ships or commerce of the United States to any
                        discrimination or disadvantage not common to all other foreign nations. That
                        even British ships were subjected to the same disadvantage; and the right of
                        exporting saltpetre to the mother country reserved to them was a right which
                        never had belonged to the United States. That commercial adventures of this
                        character were, in the nature of things, subject to any modification of law
                        which might affect the anticipated profits, and perhaps defeat them
                        altogether. That the ordinances did not constitute an embargo in any just
                        sense, whether hostile or civil. That they were municipal regulations of
                        trade, <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0094"/>not forbidden by any principle
                        known to the law of nations. And that, aside from the treaty between the
                        United States and Great Britain, they were clearly authorized by
                        international law. That a just interpretation of the third article of the
                        convention of 1815 must hold it not to prohibit the British government from
                        regulating the exportation of products of the Indies, from time to time, as
                        might be deemed expedient, or in its discretion from temporarily prohibiting
                        the exportation of some or all of such products to any foreign nation
                        whatever. And that of the occasion of such prohibition and its extent, every
                        nation must of necessity be for itself the sole judge.</p>
                    <p>That the treaty permitting the trade between the Indian ports and the United
                        States in articles the exportation of which “shall not be entirely
                        prohibited,” gave no right to those citizens to export saltpetre at the time
                        in question, the exportation of that article being by the terms of the
                        ordinances entirely prohibited. That the word “exportation" referred to
                        foreign commerce, and not to the transportation from the Indies to the home
                        ports of Great Britain. That the reservation of the right of transportation
                        to such home ports was in no respect prejudicial to the commerce of the
                        United States, they having no right to participate in the trade between
                        Indian ports and the ports of Great Britain. That the treaty itself
                        providing for this trade also provided that the citizens of the United
                        States should be subject in all respects to the laws and regulations of the
                        British government, and thus expressly subjected them to the operation of
                        ordinances like those in question authorized by the statute upon which they
                        were based. That the ordinances of 27th December and 3d January were just,
                        caused by an act of an armed vessel of the United States in violation of
                        international law, and affording a reasonable apprehension of hostilities to
                        ensue between Great Britain and the United States. That in such case all
                        means of protection and self-defense, not in themselves at variance with the
                        ordinary principles of justice, and impartially used, were permissible to
                        every government, and that this prerogative having been exercised <hi

                        emergency by a prohibition equally affecting native subjects and foreign

                        or justice to require compensation for such an unavoidable diminution of
                        their commercial profits.</p>

                    <p>The claimant in this case alleged, in substance, by his memorial that prior
                        to August, 1862, he was lawfully possessed of a certain limestone <pb n="39"
                            xml:id="pg_39" facs="0095"/>quarry and lime-kiln, together with some
                        1,500 barrels of lime, tools, furniture, &amp;c., on San Juan Island, in the
                        Territory of Washington, belonging to the United States.</p>
                    <p>That in his absence from the island in August, 1862, his wife was ejected
                        from the premises by one Roberts, a British subject, who took possession of
                        the real estate and appropriated the personal property. That claimant
                        commenced a suit against Roberts in a justice’s court of the Territory of
                        Washington to recover the possession of the premises, and obtained judgment
                        for restitution of the property, which was followed by a warrant of
                        restitution for its enforcement.</p>
                    <p>That Roberts thereupon appealed to Captain Bazalgett, commander of the
                        British forces on the island. That Bazalgett thereupon applied to Major
                        Bissell, commanding the American forces on the island, and that Major
                        Bissell thereupon arrested the claimant and the justice of the peace who had
                        rendered the judgment against Roberts, put them in the guard-house, and
                        shortly after expelled the claimant from the island.</p>
                    <p>That in April, 1864, the claimant returned to the island, and finding his
                        claim vacant, took possession of the same, providing-anew stock of tools and
                        supplies, and commenced to work the quarry; but after ten days spent in it,
                        was again forcibly removed by command of Captain Bazalgett, put in the
                        guard-house, detained two weeks, and then banished from the island and
                        forbidden ever to return.</p>
                    <p>The memorial alleged the value of the quarry at $50,000, and claimed damages
                        by occasion of the premises $100,000.</p>
                    <p>Evidence was taken on the part of the claimant tending to sustain his
                        allegations as to his possession of the property and removal therefrom.</p>
                    <p>At the time of the acts alleged the title of the island of San Juan was in
                        dispute between the United States and Great Britain, and the island was
                        occupied by a joint military force of the two governments under an
                        arrangement made between them for such joint occupancy, by which the
                        citizens and subjects of each government were made amenable to the
                        authorities of their own government only.</p>
                    <p>Pending the case before this commission, His Majesty the Emperor of Germany,
                        to whom the decision of the question was referred by the treaty of 8th May,
                        1871, decided the island to be the property of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The proofs filed on the part of the defence showed that the arrest of Tripp
                        and his expulsion from the island were by order of the commander of the
                        United States forces upon the island, and not through any assumption of
                        authority on the part of the commander of the British forces.</p>
                    <p>The claimant filed an argument admitting that the arrest and order of
                        banishment on each occasion came from the American commander, but claiming
                        that it was on the complaint of the British commander, who represented his
                        own government and made unfounded charges <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40"
                            facs="0096"/>against the claimant, which were the cause of his arrest
                        and banishment, and that by reason thereof the British government was liable
                        to his reclamation for damages.</p>
                    <p>The commission, without hearing any argument for the defense, unanimously
                        disallowed the claim.</p>

                    <p>The memorial of the claimant alleged, in effect, that prior to the 1st of
                        July, 1844, the claimant was the inventor of a certain improvement in
                        breech-loading fire-arms, for which letters patent were issued to him by the
                        United States, dated 1st July, 1844.</p>
                    <p>That in the year 1844 the British government, through Her Majesty’s consul at
                        Philadelphia, ordered of the claimant two specimen guns made under the
                        claimant’s invention and patent, which were thereupon procured to be made by
                        the claimant, and furnished through the consul to Her Majesty’s government
                        in 1845, and paid for by that government.</p>
                    <p>The memorial further alleged that “it was understood and agreed that the
                        invention of said mechanical principle” of the claimant “should be paid for
                        by Her Majesty’s government whenever it should be determined upon for
                        adoption in Her Majesty’s service.” That after the receipt of the specimen
                        guns, in 1845, it was determined by Her Majesty’s government, in the same
                        year, that it was not expedient to adopt them for use, but that
                        subsequently, on the 14th March, 1885, Her Majesty’s government made “a full
                        determination of adoption in Her Majesty’s service of breech-loading
                        firearms” known as the Snyder Enfield rifle, containing and embodying the
                        mechanical principle covered by the claimant’s invention and patent; and
                        that after such official “determination of adoption,” in March, 1865, Her
                        Majesty’s government issued to Her Majesty’s army and navy 500,000 muskets
                        of the pattern named and covered by the invention and patent of the
                        claimant.</p>
                    <p>The claimant claimed a royalty of $1 each upon these muskets, amounting to
                        $500,000, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>A demurrer was interposed by Her Majesty’s counsel to the memorial, on the
                        ground that the commission had no jurisdiction of the claim stated in the
                        memorial, and that the memorial alleged no sufficient ground of claim

                                <p>These claims arose sometimes within the loyal States, sometimes

                                    No. 1, which was for cotton taken from the claimant at

                                    an enemy of the United States. He was found in a town captured
                                    by them, and his property was liable to levies and contributions
                                    for their benefit.</p>

                                        <p>Without expressing any opinion on the effect to be given
                                            to the evidence of Thomas Ward and Sarah Ward, the
                                            commissioners are of the opinion that the receipts and
                                            vouchers given by acknowledged officers of the Army <hi
                                                rend="italic">at the time</hi>, show that the cotton
                                            was taken from the claimant for the use of the United
                                            States. This we think sufficient, in the absence of all
                                            countervailing proof, to show the taking by the United
                                            States. Nothing appears to indicate that it was taken as
                                            enemy’s property, and the question of the right so to
                                            take is, therefore, not involved. It was taken nine days
                                            after the capture of Wilmington, N. C., by the United
                                            States, and the possession of the place ever after
                                            continued in the United States. We are not, upon the
                                            facts before us, prepared to hold that, at the time of
                                            the taking of the cotton, the place was enemy’s
                                            territory. We agree, therefore, that the claimant is
                                            entitled to compensation for the property, the amount
                                            being the average value of cotton usually produced in
                                            that neighborhood, with interest at six per cent, per
                                            annum until January 31, 1873.</p>
                                        <p>We therefore award that the sum of $620.44 be paid by the

                                <p>In the case of John Wilkinson, No. 28, the claim was for beef
                                    taken from the claimant on Matagorda Island, Texas, by a
                                    commissary of the United States in 1863, and for which vouchers
                                    in the usual form were given. The claimant was domiciled and his
                                    property situated within the insurrectionary State of Texas, and
                                    apparently not within the actual military lines of the United
                                    States at the time of the taking. The vouchers were all signed
                                    by an authorized officer, and recited, “I have taken for
                                    military, purposes from John Wilkinson,” the property described,
                                    and that the same was necessary for the public service, and
                                    would be accounted for in the officer’s monthly returns.</p>
                                <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the taking
                                    was a capture under the right of war, and that no liability for
                                    payment arose against the United States.</p>

                                    United States, at Memphis, Tenn., in June, 1862, shortly after

                                <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, Mr. Commissioner
                                    Frazer dissenting upon the question of the sufficiency of
                                    proofs, but the commissioners all agreeing as to the principle
                                    involved.</p>
                                <p>It may be stated generally that the commission were unanimous in
                                    the allowance of claims for property coming under this head when
                                    taken within the loyal States or within those portions of the
                                    insurrectionary States permanently occupied by the Federal
                                    forces, except when something in the nature of the property or
                                    in the conduct of the claimant took him out of the condition of
                                    neutrality. Thus, for instance, in the case of Robert Davidson,
                                    No. 66, the claim was for gun-carriages and other artillery
                                    apparatus, manufactured by the claimant for the use of the
                                    confederate government, and remaining in his possession at the
                                    surrender of New Orleans, together with material for use in the
                                    same manufacture, which was taken and appropriated by the
                                    Federal forces, under the orders of General Banks, some months
                                    after the capture of New Orleans. The claim was unanimously
                                    disallowed.</p>
                                <p>Where, however, the taking of the property by the Federal forces
                                    and the domicile of the claimant were within the enemy’s lines,
                                    or in those portions of the enemy’s country not reclaimed from
                                    the enemy, the majority of the commission, on satisfactory
                                    evidence that the property was taken by authority, or actually
                                    appropriated to military use, made awards in favor of the
                                    claimants, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting, on the ground
                                    that one domiciled in the country of the enemy was himself an
                                    enemy in law, whether an actual enemy or not; and by
                                    well-settled principles of public law his sovereign had no right
                                    in such cases to intervene in his behalf against the ordinary
                                    treatment of him as an enemy. In the principle thus held by Mr.
                                    Commissioner Frazer, I am advised that the presiding
                                    commissioner agreed; but in view of the fact that the United
                                    States had, by the establishment of the Southern claims
                                    commission, made provision for the compensation of its own
                                    citizens domiciled within the enemy’s country who remained loyal
                                    adherents to the cause and the Government of the United States
                                    during the war,” for property taken in like manner, (16 Stat, at
                                    L., 524, § 2,) he was of opinion that neutral aliens in like
                                    situation should be entitled to the same degree of compensation,
                                    and, if British subjects, to a standing before the commission
                                    for that end.</p>
                                <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0100"/>
                                <p>Upon this question Mr. Commissioner Frazer held that any
                                    provision made for the payment of such claims to citizens was
                                    not in discharge of an obligation imposed by the public law, but
                                    was a matter of favor, and could carry with it no obligation on
                                    the part of the Government of the United States to extend like
                                    compensation to others not embraced within the class which it
                                    had selected.</p>
                                <p>In the case, however, of John Kater, No. 19, claimant was allowed
                                    for two horses taken by Sheridan’s army on its raid through the
                                    valley of Virginia in August, 1864, all the commissioners
                                    joining in this award, General Sheridan’s order of August 16,
                                    1864, directing the seizure of mules, horses, and cattle for the
                                    use of the Army, having in effect promised compensation for such
                                    property to loyal citizens.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Henry Henderson, No. 41, the claim was for 112
                                    bales of cotton seized by the United States military forces
                                    under orders of General Banks, on plantations in the State of
                                    Louisiana, outside of the Federal lines, carried to Port Hudson,
                                    and there used in the breastworks of the besieging army of
                                    General Banks for the reduction of that post.</p>
                                <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that this was a

                                    strictly military use, justified by the laws of war, and for

                                    and subject to the same treatment as other enemies. The claim
                                    was allowed by the majority of the commission, Mr. Commissioner
                                    Frazer dissenting and placing on the records of the commission a

                                    by the United States forces within the enemy’s country, not
                                    appearing to have been taken under any regular requisition or

                                <p>These claims were numerous and of great variety in regard to the
                                    circumstances of the alleged taking. It is somewhat difficult to
                                    draw the precise line of distinction by which the majority of
                                    the commission were guided in their decisions. It may, perhaps,
                                    be said generally that the commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                                    dissenting) made awards in favor of the claimant whenever it
                                    appeared by satisfactory evidence that the property so taken was
                                    a legitimate subject of military use and was actually applied to
                                    military uses, even though such application was not made through
                                    the regular and ordinary channels. On the other hand, where the
                                    property was in its nature not a proper subject of military use,
                                    or, being such, was not applied to military use, or where the
                                    taking appeared to be mere acts of unauthorized pillage or
                                    marauding, the claims were disallowed.</p>

                                <p>In the case of Thomas Stirling, No. 12, were included as well
                                    claims for property destroyed by the United States Army in its
                                    marches and encampments in the State of Virginia, as for horses,
                                    carriages, cattle, hogs, flour, corn, and bacon alleged to have
                                    been taken and carried off by the soldiers. The proofs showed
                                    nothing beyond the disappearance of the property in the presence
                                    of the United States Army. The decision of the commission, in
                                    which all the commissioners joined, was made in the following
                                    words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>The acts done upon which this claim is based seem to have
                                            been the ordinary results incident to the march of an
                                            invading army in a hostile territory, with possibly some
                                            unauthorized acts of destruction and pillage by the
                                            soldiery, with no proof of appropriation by the United
                                            States. Under such circumstances there is no ground for
                                            a valid claim against the United States. The claim is,
                                            therefore, disallowed.</p>

                                    property, alleged to have been taken by soldiers of the United
                                    States Army on the first capture of Jackson, in May, 1863. The
                                    acts complained of appeared, if committed by United States
                                    soldiers, to have been acts of pillage merely, and the claim was
                                    unanimously disallowed.</p>

                                    being in the nature of commissary’s and quartermaster’s
                                    supplies, applicable to the proper use of the Army, and

                                    tobacco, alleged to have been taken by General Sherman’s army at

                                <p>An award was made, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting, for the
                                    tobacco taken from this claimant, on proof that it was carried
                                    off in Army wagons, tobacco being allowed as an Army ration. All
                                    the other claims for property taken from this claimant were

                                    proof showing great neglect of discipline on the part of Colonel
                                    Jennison, the commanding officer, and his neglect and refusal to
                                    take any steps for the surrender of the stolen property or the
                                    punishment of the offenders when notified of the facts, and that
                                    a part, at least, of the stolen property was then in possession

                            <item><p>Claims for property taken under the abandoned and captured
                                    property act of March 12, 1863, (12 Stat, at L., 820.)</p>
                                <p>This act provided in effect for the turning over of property
                                    captured or seized as abandoned by the military and naval
                                    authorities of the United States to agents, to be appointed by
                                    the Secretary of the Treasury, for the sale of such property,
                                    and the payment of the proceeds into the Treasury; and provided
                                    that the owner of such property might, within two years after
                                    the suppression of the rebellion, bring suit for the proceeds in
                                    the Court of Claims, and, on proof of his ownership and right to
                                    the proceeds, and that he had never given aid or comfort to the
                                    rebellion, should be entitled to recover the net proceeds. The
                                    act was undoubtedly intended to apply particularly to cotton and
                                    the other staple products of the Southern States. To such
                                    products only it was in practice applied.</p>
                                <p>Many claims were brought before the commission for property,
                                    principally cotton, taken under this act. Most of the claims
                                    thus brought had been prosecuted in the Court of Claims, some of
                                    which were still pending in that court; some were pending on
                                    appeal in the <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0104"/>Supreme
                                    Court; in some the Court of Claims had given judgment in favor
                                    of the claimants for the net proceeds, the claimants now
                                    claiming here that such amount was less than the full value of
                                    their property, to which they claimed themselves entitled; and
                                    in some judgment had gone against the claimant in the Court of
                                    Claims, and no appeal had been taken. In some cases the
                                    claimants were domiciled within the insurrectionary States, and
                                    in others within the British dominions. In a few cases no suit
                                    had been prosecuted in the Court of Claims. The agent of the
                                    United States interposed demurrers in several cases, including
                                    all the different classes above named.</p>
                                <p>On the argument it was contended for the United States that the
                                    right of capture, by a belligerent, of private enemy’s property
                                    on land was permitted by the laws of war; that that right was
                                    specially applicable to the case of a great staple like cotton,
                                    upon which the enemy principally depended for his military and
                                    naval supplies, and for his credit and means to carry on the
                                    war; that by the abandoned and captured property act of 12th
                                    March, 1863, the United States had in no respect abandoned or
                                    waived this right, but that that act constituted merely an act
                                    of grace in favor of individuals who might show themselves
                                    personally free from complicity with the rebellion; that under
                                    that act neutral aliens stood upon the same footing with loyal
                                    citizens, and were entitled to the same rights given to such
                                    citizens by the act, and subject only to the same disabilities;
                                    that the owner of property thus captured within the enemy’s
                                    country had no right of reclamation against the United States,
                                    except that given by the act, and that that remedy must be
                                    pursued in the form given, and before the tribunal specified in
                                    the act.</p>

                                        <item>If under that statute the claimant has obtained a

                        the cases of John K. Byrne, No. 200; Charles Black, No. 128, and A. K.
                        McMillan, No. 250. Also, for timber felled in front of forts and batteries
                        to give clear range for the guns and deprive the enemy of cover, as in the
                        cases of Trook, administrator, No. 58, and of William B. Booth, No. 143. For
                        property alleged to have been wantonly and without provocation or military
                        necessity destroyed or injured in the enemy’s country, as in the cases of
                        Anthony Barclay, No. 5; Godfrey Barclay, No. 162, and in the Columbia
                        cases.</p>
                    <p>In these claims for destruction of property, it may be stated generally that,
                        with very few exceptions, and those mostly insignificant, no awards were
                        made against the United States.</p>
                    <p>The claims for injuries by bombardment, the passage of armies, the cutting of
                        timber to clear away obstructions, the erection of fortifications, &amp;c.,
                        in the enemy’s country, were all disallowed by the unanimous voice of the
                        commissioners.</p>
                    <p>The same may be said of the incidental destruction of innocent property
                        involved in the destruction of public stores and works of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>In several cases there were allegations of the wanton destruction of property
                        by United States troops, and in some cases satisfactory proof was made of
                        the fact of such destruction by soldiers without command or authority of
                        their commanding officers, and in defiance of orders.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Anthony Barclay, No. 5, allegations were made of wanton
                        destruction of property, including valuable furniture, china, pictures, and
                        other works of art, books, &amp;c. The proof was conflicting as to whether
                        the injuries alleged were committed by soldiers or not; but if committed by
                        soldiers, it was plainly not only without authority, but in direct violation
                        of the orders of General Sherman. In the award made in favor of Mr. Barclay,
                        I am advised that nothing was included for property alleged to have been
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Several claims were brought for property alleged to have been destroyed by
                        the burning of Columbia, on the allegation that that city was wantonly fired
                        by the army of General Sherman, either under his orders or with his consent
                        and permission. A large amount of testimony was taken upon this subject,
                        including that of General Hampton and other confederate officers on the part
                        of the claimants, and of Generals Sherman, Logan, Howard, Woods, and other
                        Federal officers on the part of the United States. The claims were all
                        disallowed, all the commissioners agreeing.</p>
                    <p>I am advised that the commissioners were unanimous in the conclusion that the
                        conflagration which destroyed Columbia was not to be ascribed to either the
                        intention or default of either the Federal or confederate officers. The
                        commission did not pass on the question whether, in case the city had been
                        burned by the order or permission of the commanding <pb n="51"
                            xml:id="pg_51" facs="0107"/>officer, any liability for resulting losses
                        would have existed against the United States.</p>
                    <p>The claim of Henry E. and Alfred Cox, No. 229, was for a saw-mill and its
                        motive-power, machinery, &amp;c., destroyed by raiding parties from General
                        Sherman’s army, near Meridian, Miss., in February, 1864. The expedition by
                        which the mill was destroyed was sent out by General Sherman for the express
                        purpose of destroying the confederate mills, supplies, railroads, and means
                        of transportation.</p>
                    <p>The proofs showed that the saw-mill in question had been actually employed in
                        the sawing of railroad-ties for the confederate government, and was
                        available for this and similar purposes.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the defense it was claimed that the destruction was a lawful
                        act of war.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>The case of William Smythe, No. 333, was a claim for an iron and brass
                        foundry, machine-shop, and machinery, fixtures, supplies, &amp;c., for same,
                        destroyed by General Sherman in Atlanta, after the capture of that city, and
                        before his advance upon Savannah. The establishment had been employed in the
                        manufacture of shot, shell, and other military supplies for the confederate
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>The case of James and Richard Martin, No. 434, was a claim for the value of
                        the British ship York, which, in January, 1862, on a voyage in ballast from
                        Valencia, Spain, to Lewistown, Delaware, was alleged to have been driven
                        ashore on the coast of North Carolina, one of the insurrectionary States,
                        and, while there stranded, to have been destroyed by United States
                        cruisers.</p>
                    <p>The proofs satisfactorily established that the vessel was actually wrecked
                        without intent of her officers, and while on a lawful voyage. An officer of
                        the United States Navy, believing her to have been intentionally beached for
                        the purpose of running in her cargo for the use of the enemy, and that the
                        cargo, with the rigging and furniture of the vessel, was actually available
                        to the rebels, boarded and burned her.</p>
                    <p>The commission made an award for her value in favor of the claimants, in
                        which all joined.</p>
                    <p>The case of James A. Macaulay, No. 260, was a claim for certain cotton, the
                        cargo of the steamship Blanche, which was alleged to have sailed from the
                        port of Lavaca, Tex., in June, 1862, and on her voyage to Havana to have
                        been pursued by the United States war-vessel Montgomery, commanded by
                        Lieutenant Hunter, to have run aground on the coast of the island of Cuba,
                        and, while so aground, to have been boarded by the crew of the Montgomery,
                        set on fire, and, with her cargo, totally destroyed.</p>
                    <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0108"/>
                    <p>The case was unanimously disallowed for lack of proof of the material
                        allegations in the memorial.</p>
                    <p>A large number of claims was brought for cotton destroyed by the United
                        States forces at various points in the insurrectionary States. Among these
                        were the cases of Brown &amp; Sharp, No. 33; John Cairns &amp; Co., No. 39,
                        and several others, for cotton destroyed at Camden, S. C.; of George Collie,
                        No. 458; Christopher Atkinson, No. 380, and others, at Columbia, S. C.; of
                        Samuel Hall Haddon, No. 107, in Screven County, Georgia; of Alexander
                        Collie, No. 376, at Oxford, Ga.; of A. R. McDonald, No. 42; John C. Forbes,
                        No. 300, and others, in Arkansas and Louisiana; and various other claims for
                        like alleged destruction at different points.</p>
                    <p>In several of these cases the proof was clear and undisputed that the cotton
                        was destroyed under express orders of the commanding officers, and for the
                        purpose of preventing it from falling into the hands of the enemy, and of
                        weakening the resources of the enemy. In other cases questions of fact were
                        in dispute, as to the fact of destruction by the United States forces; as to
                        such destruction, if committed, being by order or authority of any competent
                        officer; as to the title of the claimants to the cotton alleged to have been
                        destroyed; and as to whether the cotton, when destroyed, was within the
                        enemy’s country.</p>
                    <p>The question as to the right of the United States to destroy cotton of
                        private owners in the enemy’s country was discussed by the counsel of the
                        United States in his arguments filed in the cases of S. H. Haddon No. 107,
                        and of Brown and Sharp, No. 33; and to some extent in several other
                        cases.</p>
                    <p>On the same subject arguments were filed by Her Majesty’s counsel and by
                        counsel for the respective claimants in the cases of S. II. Haddon, No. 107;
                        Brown and Sharp, No. 33; David Jacobs, No. 236; Martha M. Calderwood, No.
                        360; John W. Carmalt, No. 89; Wood &amp; Hey worth, No. 103; James Borron,
                        No. 144, and in some other cases.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that a belligerent might
                        lawfully in the enemy’s country destroy any property, public or private, the
                        possession Or control of which might in any degree contribute to sustain the
                        enemy and increase his ability to carry on the war. That the occasion for
                        such destruction and its extent must always be left solely to the discretion
                        of the invading belligerent, who is of necessity the sole judge as to the
                        requirements of his military position, and of the necessity or propriety of
                        the destruction of property, and of the extent to which such destruction
                        shall be carried. That the actual ownership of such property within the
                        enemy’s country by the subjects of a neutral power, whether domiciled within
                        the enemy’s country or not, did not relieve such property from its liability
                        to such destruction. That cotton in the insurrectionary States was
                        peculiarly and eminently a legitimate subject for such destruction, from its
                        relation to the enemy’s <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0109"/>government,
                        as the great staple from which were derived the principal means of that
                        government for the carrying oh of the war, which was the principal basis of
                        its credit, the source of its military and naval supplies, and on which it
                        relied to maintain its independent existence and to carry on the war against
                        the United States. That the control of this staple as to production, sale,
                        and exportation, had been, to a large extent, assumed by that government.
                        That by the laws, military orders, and practice of the Confederate States
                        and their authorities, the destruction of cotton, whenever likely to fall
                        into the hands of their enemies, was enjoined and practiced, and that this
                        practice of the confederate government and its officers had received the
                        express and formal approval of the British government as a legitimate
                        practice under the laws of war.</p>
                    <p>Proofs were made in the case of Wood and Hey worth, No. 103, (proofs for
                        defense, pp. 16, 20, 24, 37 to 47, 51 to 65,) of the statutes of the
                        confederate government in regard to their control of this staple, and in
                        regard to its destruction when necessary to prevent its falling into the
                        hands of the enemy; of the practice of the confederate government in
                        controlling its production, sale, and exportation; of the acts of its
                        president and other executive and administrative officers in this regard,
                        and of the military orders and practice under the same for its destruction
                        when exposed to capture by the enemy. Other proofs in regard to this
                        practice of destruction by the confederates were made in the cases of James
                        Gumming, No. 94; A. R. McDonald, No. 42, and various other cases.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the United States, in his arguments, cited the letter from
                        Earl Russell to Lord Lyons of 31st May, 1862, from the British Blue Book
                        relating to the United States, 1863, vol. 2, p. 33, in which his lordship
                        said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Mr. Seward, in his conversation with your lordship, reported in your
                                dispatch of the 16th instant, appeared to attribute blame to the
                                confederates for destroying cotton and tobacco in places which they
                                evacuate on the approach of the Federal forces. But it appears to be
                                unreasonable to make this a matter of blame to them, for they could
                                not be expected to leave such articles in warehouses to become prize
                                of war, and to be sold for the profit of the Federal Government,
                                which would apply the proceeds to the purchase of arms to be used
                                against the South.</p>

                            xml:id="pg_54" facs="0110"/>that, by the modern law of war and the

                        on land is exempt from seizure, confiscation, or destruction, and that this
                        principle was fully recognized, in theory at least, by the United States in
                        the exercise of their belligerent rights in the late civil war; that the
                        article of cotton, the property of non-combatants, was no exception to this
                        general principle, this in fact having constituted the great mass of the
                        property the proceeds of which were allowed to be recovered in the Court of
                        Claims; that as to non-combatant citizens the United States recognized the
                        rule of the exemption of their private property from capture and
                        destruction; and that as to neutral aliens, peaceably residing in the United

                        equally favorable doctrine must be applied; that if, in any case, the
                        capture or destruction of such property became a military necessity, such
                        capture or destruction was accompanied by liability to compensation.</p>

                        exception, (that of A. R. McDonald, No. 42,) were disallowed by the
                        unanimous voice of the commissioners.</p>

                    <p>In the case of A. R. McDonald, Nos. 42 and 334, the commission made an award
                        in favor of the claimant, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting. In that case
                        the cotton was alleged to have been purchased by the claimant principally in
                        Ashley County, Arkansas, under permits issued by the proper officers of the
                        United States Treasury, under the statutes regulating trade in the
                        insurrectionary States, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury
                        made pursuant to said statutes, and to have been destroyed in the same
                        region by United States forces under the command of General Osband, in
                        February, 1865. These statutes and regulations only authorized trade in the
                        insurrectionary States within the lines of military occupancy of the United
                        States forces; and it was contended on the part of the claimants that the
                        issuing of such permits by the Treasury officers was controlling evidence
                        that the region covered by the permits, and within which the cotton was
                        alleged to have been purchased and destroyed, was actually within the
                        military lines of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the evidence
                        conclusively showed that at the time of the issuing of the permits in <pb
                            n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0111"/>question, and of the alleged
                        purchases under the same, as well as at the time of the alleged destruction,
                        the region where the cotton was situated was entirely outside the lines of
                        military occupancy of the United States, and within the control, civil and
                        military, of the confederate government; that the permits in question were
                        irregularly and unlawfully issued; that they gave no authority to the
                        claimant to purchase within the district in question; that the cotton was
                        purchased, if at all, within the enemy’s country, and under collusive
                        arrangements between the claimant and the confederate cotton bureau; that
                        the permits, even if valid when issued, afforded no protection to the cotton
                        when actually within the enemy’s lines at the time of its destruction; that
                        the claimant, by his unlawful dealings with the enemy, had forfeited any
                        possible right which he might have had under his alleged permits, and that
                        the claim was, to a large extent, fraudulent, both as to the alleged
                        purchase and destruction.</p>
                    <p>The entire claim of this claimant amounted, including interest, to over
                        $3,000,000. The award was for the sum of $197,190, including interest. I am
                        advised that, in the making of this award, the majority of the commission
                        did not intend to depart from the principle held by them in the other claims
                        for cotton destroyed; but that they regarded the permits as controlling
                        evidence that the region where the cotton was situated was within the lines
                        of Federal occupancy.</p>
                    <p>The case of John Turner, No. 44, included a claim for a dwelling-house of the
                        claimant, situated near the field of Fair Oaks, in Virginia, alleged to have
                        been for several weeks occupied as a hospital by the army of General
                        McClellan, in the spring of 1862. It was alleged by the claimant that large
                        stores of medicines and hospital supplies had accumulated in this house, and
                        that upon the retreat of General Mc-Clellan’s army, it being impossible to
                        save the stores so accumulated, the dwelling-house was burned, with its
                        contents, by the Federal officers, in order to prevent these stores from
                        falling into the hands of the enemy. The proofs substantially sustained
                        these allegations.</p>
                    <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, in which I am advised that the
                        majority of the commission included an allowance in respect of the
                        destruction of the house in question. Mr. Commissioner Frazer joined in the
                        award; but in his computation of amount included nothing for the house. In
                        no other case was any award made for the mere destruction of buildings
                        within the insurrectionary territory not permanently reclaimed to the
                        possession of the United States; and this award was therefore an exceptional
                        one, and not within the principle by which the commission was governed in
                        other cases.</p>
                    <p>The cases of A. R. McDonald, Nos. 42 and 334; of John Turner, No. 44; and of
                        J. &amp; R. Martin, No. 434, were the only cases in which awards were made
                        for the mere destruction of property within the insurrectionary States.</p>

                            destroyed by the rebels.</hi></p>
                    <p>In the case of John H. Hanna, No. 2, the memorial alleged in effect that the
                        claimant was the owner of 819 bales of cotton, situated within the rebel
                        States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and that “without fault of petitioner,
                        against his consent, and by force and arms, said cotton was destroyed by
                        rebels in arms against the Government of the United States prior to the year
                        1863.” By the schedules annexed to his memorial and made a part of the same,
                        it appeared that the cotton in question was destroyed by orders of the
                        authorities of the Confederate States and of the rebel State of Louisiana,
                        for the purpose of preventing the same from falling into the hands of the
                        Federal forces.</p>
                    <p>A demurrer to the memorial was interposed on behalf of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the argument of the demurrer it was contended by Her Majesty’s counsel, on
                        behalf of the claimant, that the acts of destruction alleged in the memorial
                        appearing to have been deliberately committed under the orders of the
                        commander of the forces of the Confederate States, and with the concurrent
                        authority of the governor of the State of Louisiana and commander of the
                        troops of that State, reclamation must lie on behalf of the British
                        government, in the interest of the claimant as a subject of that government,
                        against the United States as representing and including the State of
                        Louisiana, as well as all the other States forming the so-called Confederate
                        States; that the persons engaged in these acts of destruction were not
                        liable, either civilly or criminally, either for reparation or punishment in
                        respect of those acts, they having been committed in the course of military
                        operations under the authority of the existing government, whether lawful or
                        usurped.</p>
                    <p>That for the wrongful acts of the several States in respect to foreign
                        nations or their subjects, reclamation could be made only against the United
                        States, to the Government of which, by its Constitution, was reserved the
                        power of making treaties, declaring war, and making peace, and all
                        international powers generally, the same being denied to the individual
                        States; that no foreign nation could negotiate with or make demand upon
                        individual States in respect of such acts, but could deal only with the
                        Government of the United States; that in case of wrongs committed by any
                        State upon foreign nations, in regard to which that State, if wholly
                        independent and not a member of the Federal Union, would be liable to
                        reclamation, and to be called to account in the mode practiced between
                        nations—by treaty or by war—these remedies against such State being denied
                        to foreign powers by the Constitution of the United States, the liability
                        for reparation devolved upon the United States, and the Federal Government
                        must be held to answer as well for the acts of the authorities of its
                        several constituent States as for those of the Federal Government.</p>
                    <p>That the so-called secession of the State of Louisiana and the other States
                        forming the so-called Confederate States did not extinguish or <pb n="57"
                            xml:id="pg_57" facs="0113"/>suspend the liability of the United States
                        for wrongful acts committed by said States.</p>
                    <p>That by the treaties of 1794, 1815, and 1827, the United States had
                        stipulated with Great Britain for the protection of her subjects in the
                        State of Louisiana, as well as in all other territory of the United States;
                        that the United States not having allowed the claim of Louisiana to be
                        released from her constitutional obligations and restrictions, but having
                        held her to her constitutional obligations, and having insisted that their
                        political relations with foreign powers were in no wise affected by the
                        insurrection in the Southern States, and that the Government of the United
                        States was rightfully supreme in Louisiana and the other States in
                        rebellion, and having finally maintained its authority over those States,
                        its liability to Great Britain for violation of these treaties by those
                        respective States remained precisely as if there had been no insurrection or
                        civil war.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s counsel further contended that, as a principle of international
                        law, if the rightful government of a country be displaced and the usurping
                        government becomes liable for wrongs done, such liability remains, and
                        devolves on the rightful government when restored; that this principle
                        equally applied when the usurpation was only partial; that the restored and
                        loyal government of Louisiana was liable for wrongs done by the
                        insurrectionary government of the same State; and that it was only by the
                        provisions of the Constitution of the United States that the State of
                        Louisiana was prevented from being compelled to discharge that liability
                        toward foreign governments, and that on this ground the Government of the
                        United States must be held responsible for the acts of the State of
                        Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>He cited in support of these propositions the treaties of 1815 and 1827
                        between the United States and Great Britain, (8 Stat, at L., p. 228, art. 1;

                        and Great Britain of August 9, 1842, (8 Stat, at L., 575, art. 5;) and the
                        acts of Congress of December 22, 1869, (16 Stat, at L., 59, 60,) and of
                        April 20, 1871, (17 id., 13 to 15.)</p>
                    <p>The argument on behalf of the United States was summed up as follows: <list>
                            <item>First. That whatever may be the relations of the separate States
                                of the Union to the Government of the United States, it is manifest
                                that no responsibility can attach to the United States for the
                                destruction of the claimant’s property under color of the authority
                                of the State of Louisiana, because its destruction was not
                                authorized by any officials representing or authorized to represent
                                or act for the State of Louisiana under the Constitution and laws of
                                the United States. There can be no legitimate officers of a State to
                                constitute its government, except such as have taken an oath to
                                support the <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0114"/>Constitution of
                                the United States. All others are usurpers and pretenders. But,
                                further, a State of the Union has no political existence which can
                                he or has been recognized by Great Britain, except as a part of the
                                United States, in subordination to the National Government. The
                                rebels, who, by usurpation, undertook to act for the State of
                                Louisiana, declared their action to be in behalf of the State, which
                                they claimed as a component part of another and hostile
                                nation.</item>
                            <item>Secondly. The destruction of the claimant’s cotton was done under
                                the order of the commander of a military force engaged in
                                hostilities against the United States, and whose acts Great Britain
                                had recognized as those of a lawful belligerent, having all the
                                rights of war against the United States that any foreign invader
                                could have had. The men professing to act as the local authorities,
                                in concurring in the order of destruction acted as the assistants
                                and allies of the hostile and belligerent power, and subject to its
                                control. It is as absurd to hold the United States responsible in

                                the very purpose, and having first renounced his allegiance to
                                France and taken an oath of allegiance to Germany.</item>

                    <p>The commission unanimously sustained the demurrer in the following award:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The claim is made for the loss sustained by the destruction of cotton
                                belonging to the claimant by men who are described by the claimant
                                as rebels in arms against the Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The commissioners are of opinion that the United States cannot be

                                could exercise no control, and which acts they had no power to
                                prevent.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read an opinion, which will be found in the appendix,
                        H.</p>
                    <p>This was among the earliest of the decisions of the commission, and it is
                        understood that in consequence of it a large number of claims of similar
                        character awaiting presentation were never presented to the commission.</p>
                    <p>The cases of Laurie, Son &amp;. Co., No. 321; Samuel Irvin &amp; Co., No.
                        322, and Valentine O’Brien O’Connor, No. 404, likewise arose out of property
                        destroyed by the rebels; but in each of them it was attempted on the part of
                        the claimants to take the case out of the decision in Hanna’s case.</p>
                    <p>In each of the cases it was alleged that the claimant was the owner of
                        tobacco stored in the State of Virginia at the breaking out of the
                        rebellion; that, early in the year 1881, the ports of Virginia were
                        blockaded under the proclamation of the President of the United States, and
                        before the claimants could remove their property by land, the Congress of
                        the United States, by act of 13th June, 1861, prohibited the transportation
                        of merchandise from Virginia into the loyal States, except under license and
                        permission of the President, and in pursuance of rules to be prescribed by
                        the Secretary of the Treasury; and that <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59"
                            facs="0115"/>under the rules prescribed the claimants were unable to
                        remove the tobacco. In the cases of Laurie, Son &amp; Co. and Irvin &amp;
                        Co. it was alleged that the tobacco remained stored in Richmond until the
                        burning of that city by the rebels on the 3d April, 1865. In the case of
                        O’Connor it was further alleged that in April, 1865, claimant sent a vessel
                        from Ireland destined for Richmond, for the purpose of carrying away his
                        tobacco, which vessel arrived at Hampton Roads in June, 1865, but was warned
                        off by a public armed vessel of the United States and compelled to return to
                        Dublin without the tobacco. In this case it was further alleged that a part
                        of the tobacco was destroyed by the conflagration kindled by order of the
                        confederate authorities on the 3d April, 1865; that another portion was
                        destroyed by an accidental fire in March, 1863, but which occurred in
                        consequence of the disturbed condition of affairs then existing in Richmond;
                        that another portion was seized for taxes levied by the confederate
                        government, and another portion used and destroyed by the authorities of the
                        Confederate States for experimental purposes; and it was alleged that all
                        these losses of Mr. O’Connor were solely in consequence of the failure of
                        the United States to maintain and enforce their authority in the State of
                        Virginia, and to suppress the civil and military disorders then existing
                        there.</p>
                    <p>A demurrer was interposed on behalf of the United States in each of the three
                        cases.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s counsel filed an argument in Nos. 321 and 322, in which he
                        contended that the memorials showed a case where, by the acts of the United
                        States, the claimants were prevented from removing their tobacco from the
                        seat of war, where it was exposed to danger; and that but for such
                        prohibition they would have removed and saved it; but that they were
                        compelled to leave it in the hostile country, where it ultimately perished
                        from one of the dangers incident to the war; that the acts of the United
                        States alleged in the memorial, by which the claimants were prevented from
                        removing their tobacco, were not lawful acts under international law.</p>
                    <p>That, by the statute of 13th July, 1861, (12 Stat, at L.,) commercial
                        intercourse between the States in rebellion and the loyal States was
                        prohibited, subject only to the license and permission of the President “in
                        such articles, and for such time and by such persons as he in his discretion
                        may think most conducive to the public interest, and such intercourse, so
                        far as by him licensed, shall be conducted and carried on only in pursuance
                        of rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury;” that
                        by the regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under this act, a
                        tax was imposed upon such permits, and a special tax upon property to be
                        brought out under them, and it was provided that such permits should only be
                        granted to loyal citizens of the United States.</p>
                    <p>That this act and the subsequent legislation of the United States did <pb
                            n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0116"/>not provide for blockade or
                        non-intercourse <hi rend="italic">jure belli</hi>, but were acts regulating
                        intercourse by municipal statute between different sections of the territory
                        of the United States; that these statutes worked injustice to the claimants,
                        and deprived them of privileges to which they were entitled by the treaty
                        between the United States and Great Britain; that the loss of the property
                        in question was caused by them, and therefore was a legitimate subject of
                        international reclamation before the commission.</p>
                    <p>That, considering the prohibition in the light of a belligerent act, the
                        United States were bound, in analogy to maritime blockade, to allow a
                        reasonable time for the claimants to bring out their property; and, in
                        further analogy to the law of maritime blockade, that, as a belligerent
                        cannot blockade a port against neutrals while he allows his own or his
                        enemy’s merchant-vessels privilege of ingress and egress for the purposes of
                        trade, the United States cannot rightfully permit their own citizens to
                        trade with the insurgents under permits, while prohibiting trade to neutral
                        aliens and others without permits.</p>

                    <p>The commission unanimously, and without hearing argument for the United
                        States, sustained the respective demurrers, and disallowed the claims.</p>
                    <p>In the case of James Stewart, No. 339, it was alleged that the claimant,
                        having purchased certain cotton situated upon the Mississippi River, at Dead
                        Man’s Bend, below Natchez, sent a steamboat to remove the cotton, but that
                        the steamboat was improperly forbidden to land by the captain of a gun-boat
                        then cruising opposite the place where the cotton was stored; that the
                        claimant was thus prevented from removing his cotton, which was soon
                        afterward burned by rebel scouts.</p>
                    <p>Various questions of fact arose in this case as to the title of the claimant;
                        but it was maintained on the part of the United States that, upon the facts
                        alleged, no reclamation could lie against the United States; that the
                        discretion of the commanding officer of the gun-boat as to permitting or not
                        permitting vessels to land, even for the removal of property for which
                        permits from the civil authorities were held, was absolute; and that the
                        alleged act of the officer, in prohibiting the steamboat from approaching
                        the land and removing the property, was within the scope of his authority,
                        and in the exercise of his duty; that the subsequent destruction of the
                        property by the rebels was not a necessary or natural consequence of any
                        wrongful act of the United States or any officer of the United States, and
                        that no liability existed against the United States in respect of the
                        transaction.</p>
                    <p>The claim was disallowed, all the commissioners agreeing.</p>

                    <p rend="center">4.—<hi rend="italic">Claims for damages for alleged wrongful
                            arrest and imprisonment</hi>.</p>
                    <p>These claims were one hundred in number, and the total amount of damages
                        claimed, in all, was nearly $10,000,000, exclusive of interest; or, adding
                        interest at the rate allowed by the commission, say $16,000,000.</p>
                    <p>In thirty four of the cases awards were made in favor of the claimants
                        against the United States, in all amounting to $167,911. In sixty-four cases
                        these claims were disallowed; one case was dismissed without prejudice for
                        impertinent and scandalous language used in the memorial, and one was
                        withdrawn by Her Majesty’s agent by leave of the commission.</p>
                    <p>The question early arose before the commission whether in case of death prior
                        to the presentation of the claim of the party against whose person the
                        wrongful acts were alleged to have been committed, the claim for such
                        injuries was to be considered as surviving to the personal representatives.
                        This question was raised by demurrer interposed on behalf of the United
                        States, in the cases of Edward McHugh, No. 357; Elizabeth Sherman, No. 359;
                        and Elizabeth Brain, No. 447.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Mrs. Sherman, No. 359, all connection between the injuries
                        alleged and the death of the intestate was disclaimed by the memorial.</p>
                    <p>In the cases of Mrs. Brain, No. 447, and of McHugh, No. 357, there were
                        allegations that the injuries complained of caused or contributed to cause
                        the death of the intestate; but there was no allegation of any local statute
                        allowing damages in favor of personal representatives for a wrongful injury
                        causing death.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that, as by the common law
                        both of Great Britain and of the United States, claims for injuries to the
                        person did not survive to the personal representatives, such claims were not
                        to be considered as within the submission by article 12. That the claims
                        which by that article were submitted could not be taken to comprehend claims
                        of a character not recognized by the municipal laws of either of the
                        countries parties to the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s counsel contended that the municipal laws of the two countries
                        were not to be taken as controlling the rights of claimants in this regard;
                        that claims for injuries to the person, whether such injuries caused death
                        or not, were, in the diplomatic intercourse of civilized nations, treated as
                        a proper subject of international reclamation in behalf of the personal
                        representatives of the person injured after his death. He cited the practice
                        of the commissions under the convention between the United States and New
                        Granada, of 10th September, 1857, (12 Stat, at L., 985,) and under the
                        treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, of 2d February, 1848, between the United States
                        and Mexico, (9 Stat, at L., 933, art, 13.)</p>
                    <p>In the case of McHugh, No. 357, where the deceased died unmarried and leaving
                        only collateral relatives not dependent on him for support, <pb n="62"
                            xml:id="pg_62" facs="0118"/>entitled to inherit, the commission
                        unanimously sustained the demurrer and disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>In the cases of Mrs. Sherman, No. 359, and Mrs. Brain, No. 447, in both which
                        cases the deceased left a widow and minor children, the commission, Mr.
                        Commissioner Frazer dissenting, overruled the demurrers. Mr. Commissioner
                        Frazer read an opinion for sustaining the demurrers in each of the three
                        cases, which will be found in the appendix, I.</p>
                    <p>It may be added that on final hearing on the merits the claim of Mrs. Sherman
                        was unanimously disallowed; and though an award was made (Mr. Commissioner
                        Frazer dissenting) in favor of Mrs. Brain on account of property taken from
                        her husband, that award included no damages for imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>The following cases are selected as class cases illustrating the holdings of
                        the commission upon the various questions involved in these claims.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Ernest W. Pratt, No. 6, it was alleged that the claimant
                        arrived in New York on a British mail-steamer from Nassau, on the night of
                        the 17th March, 1865; that before leaving the vessel he was arrested by
                        order of General Dix, then in command of the United States forces in and
                        around New York, his luggage and papers searched, and he himself committed
                        to prison, where he was detained until the 25th June following, a period of
                        one hundred and seven days, when he was discharged without trial.</p>
                    <p>That he had received at Nassau, from the United States consul there, an
                        endorsement upon his discharge from the steamship City of Richmond, of which
                        he had been first mate, certifying that he was entitled to pass to the
                        United States as a British subject, which certificate had been given to him
                        by the consul with the assurance that it had all the effect of a regular
                        passport.</p>
                    <p>It appeared that in October, 1869, he had been about to commence suit against
                        General Dix to recover damages for his false imprisonment, and his counsel
                        having informed the Secretary of State of the United States of his intention
                        to bring such suit, the Secretary, by letter to his counsel in answer,
                        suggested whether it was not expedient to "await the result of the
                        deliberation of this (the United States) Government and that of Great
                        Britain upon a proposition for the establishment or adjudication, among
                        other things, of claims like that of Mr. Pratt;” and the claimant averred
                        that in conformity with this suggestion he omitted to bring his suit against
                        General Dix.</p>
                    <p>The City of Richmond, of which vessel the claimant had been first mate, had
                        been engaged in January, 1865, in carrying crew, arms, and ammunition from
                        London to the rebel cruiser Stonewall, which received substantially her
                        entire crew and armament of small-arms and ammunition by that means. On
                        parting with the Stonewall, the City of Richmond steamed to Bermuda, and
                        thence to Nassau, where her officers and <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63"
                            facs="0119"/>men were discharged, the claimant immediately proceeding to
                        New York, as above stated.</p>
                    <p>The claimant alleged in his memorial, however, that he shipped upon the City
                        of Richmond in good faith for an ordinary voyage to the West Indies, and
                        without information or suspicion that “her voyage was in any way connected
                        with either of the belligerent parties in the United States,” and that, on
                        finding her engaged in supplying the Stonewall, he had protested to his
                        captain, who paid no attention to his protest, and required him to obey
                        orders on pain of arrest for mutiny. The fact of the claimant’s having been
                        thus engaged on the City of Richmond was reported to General Dix, and this,
                        in connection with his arrival in New York from Nassau, constituted the
                        grounds of his arrest by General Dix.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the fact of the
                        claimant’s having been actively engaged in aiding the enemies of the United
                        States, and that he immediately thereafter came from Nassau, the principal
                        port in the Atlantic from which intercourse with the States in rebellion was
                        kept up through the blockade, to New York, justified the authorities of the
                        United States in arresting and holding him both as a prisoner of war and as
                        a probable spy.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that there was no proof of any
                        offence committed by the claimant against the laws of the United States, or
                        the laws or principles of neutrality. That even if he had voluntarily
                        participated in the cruise of the City of Richmond to equip the Stonewall,
                        this fact would have furnished no justification for his subsequent arrest in
                        New York, though it might have sufficed to determine Her Majesty’s
                        government not to interfere for his protection or indemnity. That the
                        informality in his passport was caused, if not contrived, by the United
                        States consul at Nassau, and that the assurance by that officer to the
                        claimant that the passport was a sufficient one was in bad faith, and made
                        with a view to the claimant’s arrest when he should arrive in the city of
                        New York, the consul having sent by the same ship a letter addressed to
                        General Dix, giving him the information upon which he acted; and that the
                        claimant’s imprisonment was unnecessarily and unjustly severe and
                        prolonged.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously awarded to the claimant the sum of $1,200.</p>
                    <p>The cases of John C. Rahming, No. 7; Joseph Eneas, No. 126; and Joseph W.
                        Binney, No. 352, were of substantially the same character, and were all
                        decided at the same time. These claimants were all domiciled in the city of
                        New York, and there engaged in trade. All were carrying on a considerable
                        trade with the port of Nassau, and were arrested on the charge of carrying
                        on an unlawful traffic with the enemies of the United States under color of
                        their trade with Nassau. Rahming and Eneas were both arrested on the 31st
                        December, 1863, and confined <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0120"/>under
                        military authority in Fort Lafayette, until July 2, 1864, and then
                        discharged without trial, on giving bonds for their appearance if called on
                        for trial by the United States authorities. Rahming had also been previously
                        arrested, on a charge of having shipped arms to the rebels, in September,
                        1861, and had then been detained as a prisoner in Fort Lafayette for fifteen
                        days. Binney was arrested on the 14th June, 1864, imprisoned in Fort
                        Lafayette under military authority for five weeks, and then transferred to a
                        jail in the city of New York, where he was detained seventeen days longer
                        and was then discharged by General Dix without any bonds or security
                        required.</p>
                    <p>In each of these cases it was alleged by the claimant, and proofs were taken
                        in support of such allegations, that the claimants were innocent of the
                        offences charged against them; that their imprisonment was unnecessarily and
                        improperly protracted; and that they received improper and unnecessarily
                        severe treatment during their imprisonment. Proofs were taken on the part of
                        the United States to show the charges against them well founded, and to
                        rebut the charges of improper treatment. In each of the cases allegations
                        were also made of large resulting damages to the claimants by reason of
                        their imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>Rahming, by his memorial, claimed damages $580,800, besides interest. He was
                        awarded by the majority of the commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                        dissenting on the question of amount merely) the sum of $38,500.</p>
                    <p>Eneas claimed damages $720,000, besides interest, and was awarded $1,540, all
                        the commissioners joining.</p>
                    <p>Binney claimed $100,000, besides interest, and was awarded $5,390, all the
                        commissioners joining.</p>
                    <p>In each of the cases I am advised that the decision turned upon questions of
                        fact, all the commissioners agreeing that the proofs, though sufficient to
                        warrant the arrest in each case, did not leave the truth of the charges free
                        from doubt; and that the detention of the prisoners without trial was
                        unnecessarily protracted. Mr. Commissioner Frazer, read an opinion in the
                        case of Rahming, which will be found in the appendix, I.</p>
                    <p>In the case of John Carville Stovin, No. 23, claimant was arrested at
                        Cumberland, Md., in October, 1861, on the charge of disloyalty, in attending
                        secession meetings in Cumberland, and being the means of transmitting
                        information to the enemy. He was taken to Fort Mc-Henry, there detained for
                        about five weeks, and discharged without trial. He alleged that his business
                        as a manufacturer at Cumberland was stopped, and in effect destroyed by his
                        arrest, and claimed damages $380,794.27, besides interest; including,
                        however, some fire-wood, hay, corn, and oats, alleged to have been taken and
                        appropriated by the United States soldiers. He alleged, also, ill-treatment
                        while in confinement. Proofs were taken on both sides on the question of his
                            <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0121"/>disloyal conduct, and it was
                        contended on the part of the United States that the facts of the case
                        justified his arrest as a disloyal person, openly giving aid and comfort to
                        the rebellion by his language and expressions of sympathy, in a village
                        situated upon the frontiers of the enemy’s country, and where such conduct
                        involved danger to the military operations of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant the charges of disloyal conduct and language were
                        denied, and proof was adduced to show him a law-abiding and peaceable
                        inhabitant.</p>
                    <p>The commission gave an award to the claimant of $8,300, all the commissioners
                        joining.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Frank Russell Reading, No. 43, the claimant was arrested in
                        the city of Washington on the 6th July, 1864, that city then being
                        threatened by the rebel forces under General Early; was brought to trial
                        before a military commission in Washington on the charge of uttering
                        disloyal and treasonable language in the District of Columbia when
                        threatened by the enemy, such language being calculated to give aid,
                        comfort, and assistance to the enemy. He was found guilty by the commission,
                        and sentenced to imprisonment for five years, with hard labor, at the Dry
                        Tortugas, or such other military prison as the Secretary of War might
                        select. Under this sentence he was imprisoned at Fort Delaware from the 30th
                        August, 1864, till 1st June, 1865.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the military
                        commission was a lawful tribunal, competent for the trial and punishment of
                        military offences, and having full jurisdiction of the case of the claimant,
                        both as to subject-matter and person; that at the time of his arrest and
                        trial Washington was a city in military occupation, environed by forts of
                        the United States, occupied and defended by their armies, the headquarters
                        of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and, as
                        the capital of the country, always a vital point of attack for the rebel
                        forces, and at this specific time the actual objective point of a vigorous
                        and determined attack by the enemy, who actually reached, as their advanced
                        post, on the 12th July, Fort Stevens, within the limits of the District of
                        Columbia and within four or five miles of the Capitol.</p>
                    <p>That the offence charged against Reading was a purely military offence, of
                        which the civil tribunals had not cognizance, and so was not within the
                        principle held by the Supreme Court in the case of Milligan, (4 Wall.,
                        2.)</p>
                    <p>That Reading having appeared in person and by counsel before the military
                        tribunal, and having pleaded in chief, without raising any question to the
                        jurisdiction, could not be heard to question the jurisdiction of the
                        tribunal as to his person merely; and that the commission having by law
                        jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the charge, the failure to object to
                        jurisdiction as to the person obviated all question as to <pb n="66"
                            xml:id="pg_66" facs="0122"/>their complete jurisdiction. The counsel for
                        the United States cited the case of Vallandigham, (1 Wall., 243.)</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the military tribunal had
                        no jurisdiction whatever, and that the imprisonment of the claimant under it
                        was wholly without authority of law.</p>
                    <p>The commission gave a unanimous award in favor of the claimant for
                        $15,400.</p>
                    <p>In the case of John I. Shaver, No. 51, the memorial alleged that the
                        claimant, being at the time domiciled in Canada, but travelling in the
                        United States on the business of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, a Canadian
                        corporation, of which he was an agent, was arrested at Detroit, on the 15th
                        October, 1801, by direction of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State of the
                        United States; that he was taken thence to Fort Lafayette, in New York
                        Harbor, and confined there, and subsequently at Fort Warren, in Boston
                        Harbor, until the 6th January, 1862. He alleged that by his arrest he was
                        thrown out of lucrative employment as agent of the railway company named;
                        that by it he lost the confidence of his employers and was unable to regain
                        his position after his release; and that he suffered large pecuniary losses
                        in consequence. He claimed damages $100,000.</p>
                    <p>The arrest was made upon information communicated to Mr. Seward that the
                        claimant was engaged in conveying communications between the rebels in
                        Canada and those within the insurrectionary States. The proofs failed to
                        sustain the charge, and it appeared that Mr. Kennedy, chief of police of the
                        city of New York, immediately after the arrest of the claimant, reported to
                        the State Department that he found no proofs to warrant his detention, or to
                        implicate him in any improper communication with the enemy.</p>
                    <p>The commission awarded the claimant $30,204, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                        dissenting on the question of amount only.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Samuel G. Levy, No. 61, it appeared that the claimant, a
                        resident of Canada, on landing in Boston from a British steamship from
                        Liverpool in May, 1864, was taken thence to New York, and there detained for
                        about eight days, on a charge of being engaged in blockade-running. At the
                        end of that time he was discharged upon giving bail for his appearance
                        within six months, if required. He alleged large consequential damages by
                        interference with his due attention to his business, and by the enforced
                        breaking of an engagement of marriage in consesequence of his arrest, and
                        claimed as damages, £20,000.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously gave him an award of $930.</p>
                    <p>In the case of James Stott, No. 271, it appeared that the claimant, domiciled
                        in the State of Maine, was arrested at Dexter, Me., September 2, 1863, on
                        the charge of being a deserter from a cavalry regiment in the United States
                        service; was sent thence to the regiment from which he was <pb n="67"
                            xml:id="pg_67" facs="0123"/>alleged to have deserted, at Warren ton,
                        Va., where it plainly appeared that the charge was unfounded, it being a
                        case of mistaken identity. He was detained until the 9th of November, 1863;
                        and, for the purpose of making him some compensation as to loss of time, and
                        of giving him transportation back to his home, was mustered into the United
                        States service and discharged with the pay of a private soldier for the time
                        he had been detained, and with transportation back to his home.</p>
                    <p>An award was made for $775 in favor of the claimant, in which all the
                        commissioners joined.</p>
                    <p>John I. Crawford, No. 79, was arrested in the city of New York, on the 10th
                        of May, 1864; sent to Fort Lafayette, and there detained until the 27th of
                        July, 1864, when he was brought to trial before a military commission in the
                        city of New York, on the charge of violation of the laws of war, in passing
                        through the military lines of the enemy, first, from South Carolina, by way
                        of Richmond, to New York; second, from New York again, by way of Nassau and
                        Wilmington, through the blockade, to South Carolina; and again from South
                        Carolina, by way of Richmond, to New York; and also by purchasing goods in
                        New York, and sending the in thence through the lines to Richmond, Va. He
                        was, convicted on all the specifications except that relating to the
                        purchasing and sending of goods, and was sentenced to give bonds in such sum
                        and with such sureties as should be satisfactory to the general in command
                        of the department, that he would not visit, traffic, or correspond with the
                        States in rebellion, nor give aid, comfort, or information to the enemy
                        during the war, in default of giving such bonds to be confined at hard labor
                        during the war. The bond was immediately given, and Crawford was discharged.
                        The proofs before the commission fully sustained the findings of the
                        military tribunal.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the military tribunal was
                        without jurisdiction, and that the claimant’s imprisonment and detention
                        were unlawful.</p>
                    <p>The memorial claimed $500,000 as damages, and the commission unanimously
                        disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>In the case of John Carmody, No. 85, it appeared that the claimant, domiciled
                        in New Orleans, was, in March, 1865, conscripted into the military service
                        of the United States; the notice of his conscription requiring him to report
                        for military service was addressed to him by the name of John Kemdy, and on
                        receiving it he procured from the British consul at New Orleans a
                        certificate of his British nationality, which he alleged that he presented
                        to the officer in charge of the office at which he was required to report,
                        but two days after was arrested by a squad of United States soldiers, and
                        was detained in a military prison for some five or six weeks. The arrest and
                        detention evidently arose from mistake growing out of the confusion of
                        names. The memorial <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0124"/>claimed $100,000
                        damages, besides interest, and the commission unanimously awarded the
                        claimant $500.</p>
                    <p>In the case of William Patrick, No. 97, it appeared that the claimant a
                        British merchant, domiciled in New York, was, on the 28th August, 1861,
                        arrested and committed to Fort Lafayette, where he was detained till the
                        13th September following, when he was discharged. His arrest was based on
                        the charge that the firm in New York of which he was a member, and which had
                        a branch house also at Mobile, Ala., was a channel for carrying on
                        correspondence between rebels in Europe and those in the insurrectionary
                        States. Representations by highly respectable citizens of New York of Mr.
                        Patrick’s loyalty were made to the Secretary of State, and the British
                        minister also intervened in his behalf. Investigation showed that the charge
                        against Mr. Patrick was without foundation, and he was discharged after a
                        confinement of seventeen days. The proofs established Mr. Patrick to have
                        been a gentleman of high social and business standing, and also to have been
                        in conduct marked by loyalty and good faith toward the Government during the
                        rebellion, and to have furnished liberal contributions in its aid. His
                        arrest was undoubtedly caused by false or erroneous information.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the claimant punitory damages were claimed. On the part of the
                        United States it was insisted that no such damages could be allowed; that
                        Mr. Patrick, domiciled within the United States, was exposed in the same
                        degree with citizens of those States to arrest on false charges or erroneous
                        information, and that, having been discharged within a reasonable time for
                        inquiry to be made, he was not entitled to claim damages against the United
                        States. That if any damages were awarded to him, they should be such only as
                        would afford him fair compensation for the injury inflicted.</p>
                    <p>The memorial claimed $100,000, besides interest. The commission awarded the
                        claimant $5,160, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting on the question of
                        amount.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Joseph J. Bevitt, No. 104, the claimant, until that time
                        domiciled in South Carolina and Virginia, left Richmond in April, 1863, and
                        passed through the rebel lines to the Potomac River, was there taken on
                        board a United States transport steamer on the 30th April, 1863, taken to
                        Washington, detained in the Old Capitol prison until the 19th May, and then
                        sent back into the confederacy.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant, it was contended that Bevitt, being a British
                        subject, and not having offended against the laws of the United States, or
                        taken part in the domestic strife then in progress, was entitled to such
                        egress without molestation by the public authorities.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the attempt of the
                        claimant to enter the loyal portion of the United States from the enemy’s
                        country, and through his military lines, after having voluntarily <pb n="69"
                            xml:id="pg_69" facs="0125"/>remained within the enemy’s country during
                        two years of the war, was one which the United States might lawfully prevent
                        or punish, and that their sending him back into the enemy’s country, from
                        which he came, was an act permitted by public law.</p>
                    <p>The commission disallowed the claim, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                    <p>In the case of William Ashton, No. 325, the claimant, until then domiciled in
                        the State of South Carolina, in February, 1863, came north through the
                        Federal lines under a pass from the confederate General Lee, and while
                        crossing the Potomac River into the State of Maryland was arrested by the
                        naval patrol, on the 7th February, 1863. He was taken to Washington, there
                        detained until the 11th May, 1863, and then sent back through the lines into
                        the enemy’s country.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the case was parallel
                        with that of Bevitt, above reported, and that the arrest, detention, and
                        return of the claimant were lawful acts under the recognized laws of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The commission awarded to him the sum of $6,000, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                        dissenting.</p>
                    <p>The undersigned finds difficulty in reconciling the decision of the
                        commission in this case with that in the case of Bevitt. It may be noted,
                        however, that Bevitt was detained but twenty days before being sent back,
                        while Ashton was detained three months and four days.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Thomas Barry, No. 127, the claimant, domiciled at New Orleans,
                        alleged that, on the 15th March, 1864, he was arrested without any cause or
                        provocation, but arbitrarily and maliciously, by a provost -marshal under
                        the orders of General Banks, then in command of the department; was
                        committed to the parish prison, there confined for ten weeks, and then
                        released on giving a bond conditioned that he should report daily to the
                        provost-marshal in the city of New Orleans. That he continued so to report
                        until the 31st December, 1864, when the bond was cancelled and the claimant
                        fully discharged. He claimed damages $50,000. The proofs showed that he was
                        arrested in the act of clandestinely and in disguise attempting to pass from
                        New Orleans through the lines into the enemy’s country, having upon his
                        person letters to residents within the enemy’s lines, and carrying
                        confederate money—the use of which was forbidden by the Federal authorities.
                        That only two months before he had perpetrated the same offence in the same
                        disguise; had visited many places within the enemy’s lines, and had returned
                        into the Federal lines in the same clandestine manner. Before his arrest he
                        had applied for permits to go within the confederate lines for the alleged
                        purpose of looking up and bringing back cotton alleged to have been owned by
                        him; but such permission had been refused.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0126"/>
                    <p>In the case of Henry Glover, No. 134, the claimant, a resident of the State
                        of Georgia, was, in November, 1864, in company with a companion, in Jones
                        County, Georgia, within the enemy's territory, overtaken by a detachment of
                        cavalry from the corps of General Kilpatrick, forming a part of the flanking
                        force of General Sherman’s army in the march from Atlanta to Savannah. His
                        companion fled and was fired upon; claimant waited, was arrested and
                        detained for twenty-four hours, when he was discharged, it appearing that he
                        was a civilian and a British subject.</p>
                    <p>His claim was disallowed, all the commissioners agreeing.</p>
                    <p>The case of Thomas H. Facer, No. 203, was similar in character to that of
                        Glover, and was disallowed in like manner.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the administrators of James Syme, No. 139, it appeared that
                        the decedent had been for many years domiciled at New Orleans, and there
                        carrying on a large trade as a wholesale and retail druggist; that on the
                        28th August, 1862, he was arrested and taken before Major-General Butler,
                        then in command of the Department of the Gulf, and there arraigned on
                        charges styled in the memorial “false, wicked, and malicious,” to the effect
                        that he had aided and abetted the so-called confederates by the shipment of
                        sulphur, drugs, and medicines into their lines, and that he had violated his
                        neutrality. General Butler? being satisfied of the truth of the charges,
                        condemned him, without the intervention of any court or military tribunal,
                        to be imprisoned at Fort Pickens for three years at hard labor with ball and
                        chain; the ball and chain were, however, within a few days, and before the
                        commencement of execution of the order, remitted. He was detained in
                        confinement at New Orleans for about six weeks; then sent under guard to
                        Fort Pickens, in Pensacola Harbor, Florida, and there confined until about
                        the 1st March, 1863, when he was brought back to New Orleans, and there
                        detained during an investigation by a military commission, which reported
                        him not guilty of the charges upon which he was imprisoned Pending the
                        proceedings of this commission he was discharged from confinement by order
                        of General Banks, who had succeeded General Butler in command, on giving a
                        bond, with surety, in the sum of $20,000, conditioned for his appearance on
                        requirement by the Government. Upon the report of the commission the bond
                        was canceled August 28, 1863. At the same time with his arrest his
                        drug-store and contents, in New Orleans, were seized and appropriated to the
                        use of the United States, and remained in their possession until about the
                        1st May, 1864, when the store, with so much of the stock of drugs, &amp;c.,
                        as had not been used, was surrendered to his possession by order of the War
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>A large amount of testimony was taken on both sides upon the question of his
                        guilt or innocence of the charges on which he was imprisoned.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0127"/>
                    <p>On the part of the United States, it was also proved that the decedent, in
                        November, 1861, and again in March, 1862, had accepted commissions as
                        surgeon—first with the rank of captain, and afterwards with the rank of
                        major—in the battalion of the Louisiana State militia designated as the
                        British Fusiliers; that this battalion was a regularly organized portion of
                        the State militia of the rebel State of Louisiana, but was organized under
                        the reservation that its members should be required to serve only within the
                        limits of the city of New Orleans; that, on the acceptance of these
                        commissions, the decedent was required by law to take, and did take, an oath
                        faithfully to discharge the duties of the office to which he had been
                        appointed, and to support, protect, and defend the constitution of the State
                        of Louisiana and of the Confederate States; that at the time of accepting
                        these com missions, respectively, the decedent was above the age of
                        forty-five years, and was exempt by the laws of the State of Louisiana from
                        militia service, by reason of age, even if otherwise liable by reason of
                        nationality or domicile. Evidence was also given on the part of the United
                        States to the effect that Dr. Syme, shortly after the occupation of New
                        Orleans by the Federal forces, refused to sell medical and surgical supplies
                        to medical officers of the United States Army. Dr. Syme died in January,
                        1872, before the filing of the memorial, leaving a widow and one son
                        entitled to inherit his estate, both born within the United States and
                        always domiciled there.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that by the acceptance of
                        these commissions and the taking of the oaths above recited, Dr. Syme had
                        deprived himself of the condition of a neutral alien and assumed the
                        character of an enemy of the United States, and was not entitled to a
                        standing as a British subject under the treaty; that the proofs fully
                        sustained the charges upon which he was condemned by General Butler; that if
                        any doubt existed upon the proofs now before the commission as to the truth
                        of those charges, the evidence before General Butler and upon which he acted
                        was certainly sufficient to sustain his finding and to justify the
                        condemnation pronounced by him upon the proofs before him; that as military
                        commander of a captured city within the enemy’s country, then strictly and
                        solely under military government, General Butler was vested with full
                        authority to administer military law, either in person or through military
                        courts and tribunals organized under his order; that the offense of which he
                        found Dr. Syme guilty was a crime under military law of a high grade, and
                        justifying the sentence pronounced upon him.</p>
                    <p>The memorial claimed damages for the arrest and imprisonment, $100,000; for
                        the drugs and other property of the decedent taken and appropriated by the
                        United States, (less the value of the amount returned,) and the rent of the
                        store, $166,925; and damages by the breaking up of the business of the
                        decedent, and the loss of profits which he would have derived from the
                        business, $150,000, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made an award <pb n="72"
                            xml:id="pg_72" facs="0128"/>in favor of the claimants for $116,200. I am
                        advised that this award included nothing for damages for imprisonment, but
                        was made solely in respect of the drugs and other property taken and
                        appropriated by the United States, and the rent of the drug-store while
                        occupied by them. Mr. Commissioner Frazer expressed his views upon the case
                        as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Being over the military age, and exempt from military duty as a
                                druggist also, Dr. Syme took a commission in the British Fusiliers
                                and an oath of office to support the rebel confederacy, and evinced
                                his hostility further, as I deem the weight of the evidence to show,
                                by refusing to sell goods to the United States after New Orleans
                                fell into Federal possession. This made him an actual enemy, and he
                                could have no standing to prosecute a claim before this commission.
                                The beneficiaries—his wife and child—have none, because they are
                                Americans. His condemnation by General Butler was upon what appeared
                                at the time to be satisfactory evidence, though it was subsequently
                                shown before the military commission, organized under the order of
                                General Banks, that he was probably innocent of the charges upon
                                which he was arrested. He was restored to liberty as soon as an
                                investigation could conveniently be had; and what remained
                                unconsumed of his confiscated goods was also restored, together with
                                the possession of his building.</p>

                    <p>In so much of this opinion of Mr. Commissioner Frazer as relates to the
                        sufficiency of the evidence upon which General Butler acted to sustain his
                        finding and sentence, and as relates to the probable actual innocence of Br.
                        Syme as appearing before the commission, I am advised that the majority of

                    <p>In the case of William B. Booth, No. 143, a claim was made for $56,000
                        damages for the alleged wrongful arrest of the claimant in the neighborhood
                        of Fort Jackson, Louisiana, and subsequent imprisonment. He was arrested by
                        United States soldiers on the 8th August, 1862, taken to Fort Jackson, and
                        there confined till the 28th August; then sent to Fort Pickens, Pensacola
                        Harbor, and there confined till the 15th August, 1863; then taken back to
                        New Orleans and detained till the 26th August, 1863, when he was
                        unconditionally released.</p>
                    <p>Previous to his arrest, Dr. Booth, who resided in Louisiana, two miles from
                        the forts and outside the lines of military occupation by the United States,
                        had been on the request of Dr. Gordon, the surgeon of the forts, visiting
                        and prescribing for the prisoners and Federal soldiers at the forts. Gen.
                        Neal Dow, the commander, learning the fact, had notified him that he could
                        not be permitted to visit the forts without taking the oath of allegiance,
                        or giving his parole of honor not to communicate information to the enemy.
                        Dr. Booth declined to do either of these things. After his arrest he still
                        continued his refusal to give the required parole, and, persisting in his
                        refusal, General Dow ordered his transfer to Fort Pickens and his detention
                        there. At this time Forts Jackson and Saint Philip, lying on the opposite
                        banks of the Mississippi some one hundred miles or more below the city of
                        New Orleans, were occupied by a United States force of about six hundred
                        soldiers, and about the same number of liberated slaves, under the command
                        of General Dow. The garrisons were weak, and a <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73"
                            facs="0129"/>large number of the troops actually there were prostrated
                        by sickness. General Dow deemed it of the utmost importance that a knowledge
                        of the weakness of his garrison should be kept from the enemy. The refusal
                        of Dr. Booth to give the required parole roused the suspicions of General
                        Dow, and when persisted in, led to his sending the claim ant to Fort
                        Pickens. During his stay at Fort Pickens, and after his retransfer thence to
                        New Orleans, he still persisted in refusing to give the required parole, and
                        was finally discharged, after a confinement of nearly thirteen months,
                        unconditionally and without parole. Lord Lyons, during his confinement, in a
                        letter to Mr. Coppell, British consul at New Orleans, stated that the
                        required parole was deemed not unreasonable by Her Majesty’s government,
                        after consulting the law officers of the Grown.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was insisted that the arrest and
                        detention of Dr. Booth were warranted as measures of just military
                        precaution in regard to an enemy by domicile possessed of knowledge, the
                        communication of which to the enemy would be highly dangerous to the United
                        States, and who, by his refusal to give this proper and reasonable pledge,
                        had, in the language of Lord Lyons, entitled the United States to treat him
                        as a suspected person.</p>
                    <p>The memorial of Dr. Booth also included claims to the amount of $83,890,
                        besides interest, for property of the claimant alleged to have been taken
                        and appropriated by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) awarded to the claimant
                        the sum of $24,900, which award was, as I am advised, wholly in respect of
                        property taken, and included nothing on account of the arrest and
                        imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>John McCann, No. 173, and John Murta, No. 195, natives of Ireland and
                        domiciled in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, were arrested there—McCann in
                        September, 1863, and Murta in November, 1863–—by United States troops, under
                        authority of a provost-marshal; were taken to Fort Mifflin and there
                        confined, McCann till March and Murta till April, 1864.</p>
                    <p>The proofs showed that at the time of their arrest an organized conspiracy
                        existed in Luzerne County and vicinity to resist the Federal draft for
                        troops; that great violence was used against Federal officers; that open
                        defiance of the Federal authority was made in public meetings of the mining
                        population; that loyal citizens sustaining the Government had been
                        assassinated, and measures had been adopted to ambuscade and massacre
                        Federal troops, should they be sent there to enforce the draft; that the
                        principal disturbing element in this conspiracy was the Irish Catholic
                        miners; that not only secret associations were formed, but public meetings
                        were openly held for the avowed purpose of stopping the mines and thus
                        stopping the war; that a large number of persons regarded as the ringleaders
                        and most dangerous persons in this movement were arrested, and among them
                        these two claimants. No proof was made of the complicity of either of the
                        claimants <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0130"/>with the actual resistance
                        to the draft or violation of law; but Murta was shown to have been a member
                        of the organization known as the “Knights of the Golden Circle,” created to
                        oppose the draft and aid the rebellion. Neither of the claimants was ever
                        brought to trial.</p>
                    <p>In the case of McCann an award was made in favor of the claimant for $3,000,
                        in which all the commissioners joined. In the case of Murta an award was
                        made for $1,200, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Thomas Riley, No. 192, the claimant, a resident of Luzerne
                        County, Pennsylvania, was drafted into the United States military service in
                        November, 1863, was taken to Philadelphia and there held in the United
                        States military barracks for about six weeks, when he was taken sick and
                        sent to the hospital, and there remained confined by disease till the 6th of
                        April, 1864, when he was discharged by the War Department, through the
                        intervention of Lord Lyons, as being a subject of Great Britain, having
                        received his pay as a soldier for the time during which he was held.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that he was held simply in
                        consequence of his failure to comply with the regulations of the
                        provost-marshal’s department in regard to showing proof of alienage. The
                        case showed, however, that the proofs of his alienage were submitted by Lord
                        Lyons to Mr. Seward in November, 1863, within a few days after his arrest,
                        and his discharge was not ordered till about four months after.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously awarded him the sum of $300.</p>
                    <p>Edward McCabe, No. 197, was drafted into the military service of the United
                        States in Queens County, New York, in September, 1883. He appeared before
                        the enrolling-board and claimed exemption; was informed of the regulation
                        prescribing the method of making the necessary proof; was given time to file
                        it, but failing to do so was arrested by order of the provost-marshal and
                        detained for two days, when, having furnished the necessary proof, he was
                        discharged.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed his claim.</p>
                    <p>Patrick J. O’Mulligan, No. 476, was drafted in Cayuga County, New York, in
                        October, 1863. He appeared before the board of enrollment and claimed
                        exemption as a British subject, but failed to comply with the regulations
                        for the proof of alienage. He was detained for twenty-four hours, and on
                        physical examination by the surgeon was found unfit for military service and
                        was discharged. For these grievances he claimed the sum of $800,000, besides
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>His claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>In the ease of Mary Sophia Hill, No. 198, the claimant, a native of Ireland,
                        was domiciled during the rebellion and for many years before in New Orleans.
                        At the time of the capture of New Orleans by the <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75"
                            facs="0131"/>Federal forces in 1862, she was in attendance on the
                        confederate hospitals in Virginia, but shortly after returned to New Orleans
                        under a proper pass. In 1863 she went to Ireland, and returned to New
                        Orleans, taking the oath of neutrality on landing. She again left New
                        Orleans in the fall of 1863 under a pass and went to Virginia, where she
                        remained for five months “rendering assistance in the hospitals and to
                        prisoners by means of flags of truce.” In 1864 she returned to New Orleans,
                        and having no pass was arrested and detained in prison for two days; when,
                        having satisfied the provost-marshal that she was a British subject, she was
                        released on bail. After her discharge and while sick she alleged that she
                        was called upon by a woman who gave the name of Ellen Williams, and gave her
                        a note purporting to be from Gen. Tom Taylor, an officer of the confederate
                        service commanding a post within the confederate lines in Louisiana. This
                        woman informed claimant that she was going through the lines into the
                        confederacy if she could get a pass from General Banks, and offered to take
                        letters from the claimant. Claimant gave to her a letter to General Taylor,
                        acknowledging the receipt of his letter, and saying to him, “Communicate and
                        state what you require, and I will do all in my power; I will be here until
                        the end of July.” She also gave to her a letter addressed to her brother, a
                        soldier in the confederate service in Virginia, in which she denounced the
                        “Yankees;” and said, among other things, “We have accounts of the battles in
                        Richmond, but so hashed up to suit northern palates you can make neither
                        head nor tail of the affair; but through my spectacles I see General Grant
                        and his well-whipped army with their faces toward Washington and their backs
                        to the hated city of Richmond, except those who take their summer residence
                        at Libby. Tell the boys Banks has made a splendid commissary to Dick
                        Taylor’s army, and they were so ungrateful as also to whip him, and very
                        badly.” She also gave this woman another letter of similar character,
                        addressed to Mrs. Graham, a person living in Montgomery, Alabama, within the
                        lines of the confederacy.</p>
                    <p>These letters were delivered on the 20th May, 1864; and within a few days
                        after she was arrested by an officer of the provost-marshal’s bureau,
                        committed to prison, and there detained until July, when she was brought
                        before a military commission and tried on the charge of “holding
                        correspondence with and giving intelligence to the enemy, in violation of
                        the Fifty-seventh Article of War,” the specifications being the written
                        letters above named. She was found guilty of the charge except the words
                        “and giving intelligence to;” and was sentenced to “be confined during the
                        war, at such place as the commanding general may direct.” The proceedings
                        and findings of the commission were approved by Major-General Hurlbut, then
                        in command; but the sentence was so modified as to direct the claimant to be
                        sent into the so-called confederacy as an enemy; and the
                        provost-marshal-general was charged with the execution of the order.</p>

                    <p>At the time of her trial New Orleans was still under military government, but
                        the United States district court had been reorganized under Judge Durell,
                        and was in operation in that city. No State tribunals were in operation, nor
                        any local tribunals, except under authority and permission of the military
                        commander.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended, first, that the claimant was
                        not amenable to military jurisdiction, but must be tried, if at all, before
                        the civil tribunals; second, that if amenable to military jurisdiction, the
                        commission before which she was tried was not a competent tribunal; that by
                        the Fifty-Seventh Article of War (2 Stat. at L., 366) the only military
                        tribunal having cognizance of such an offence was a court-martial, a
                        tribunal distinct and different from a military commission; third, that the
                        finding of the military commission that she was guilty of the charge except
                        the words “and giving intelligence to,” was in fact an acquittal,
                        correspondence with the enemy without giving him intelligence not being a
                        military offence or a violation of the article above referred to; fourth,
                        that the commanding officer had no authority to change the punishment
                        directed by the sentence of the court, and substitute banishment into the
                        confederacy for imprisonment; that this substitution was not with the
                        consent of the claimant, and was not a mitigation of punishment; fifth, that
                        the letters were not in fact sent into the confederacy, but were delivered
                        by the messenger to the United States military authorities in New Orleans,
                        and that the evidence tended to prove that the pretended messenger to whom
                        they were delivered was in fact a spy and agent of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the offence charged
                        against the claimant was a military offence purely, not cognizable by the
                        civil tribunals; that the claimant, domiciled in a city within the enemy’s
                        country and recently captured from the enemy, held by military power only,
                        and governed only by military authority, was amenable to military
                        jurisdiction; that the tribunal before which she was tried was a competent
                        military tribunal, organized under sufficient military authority, and having
                        jurisdiction both of the subject-matter and of the person of the claimant;
                        that irrespective of the proceedings, finding, or sentence of the
                        commission, the commanding general had ull authority to expel the claimant
                        from the city and send her within the enemy’s lines, on satisfactory
                        evidence of her active sympathy with the rebellion, and of her attempt
                        merely to communicate with the enemy, and that the modification and
                        mitigation by the commanding general of the punishment decreed by the
                        military tribunal was one of lawful power, and was not a matter of which the
                        claimant could rightfully complain.</p>
                    <p>The commission gave an award in favor of the claimant for $1,560, Mr.
                        Commissioner Frazer dissenting. This claimant was the same person whose
                        original memorial (No. 8) was dismissed by the commission on account of its
                        improper and indecorous language.</p>

                    <p>The case of Colin J. Nicolson, No. 253, may properly be reported in
                        connection with that of Miss Hill. Nicolson, a native of Scotland, had been
                        domiciled in New Orleans since 1852. He was arrested in that city on the
                        15th of September, 1864; was detained in prison till the 22d of November,
                        1864, when he was brought before a general court-martial in that city and
                        tried on the charges, first, of relieving the enemy with money, by investing
                        money in bonds of the Confederate States and transmitting the same to
                        England for sale there; and, second, of holding correspondence with the
                        enemy by letters passing between himself and one Violett, an enemy of the
                        United States, resident at Mobile; and in and by such correspondence
                        devising means for bringing cotton out of the confederacy, and disposing of
                        it for the joint benefit of himself and Violett, and for negotiating and
                        selling bonds of the Confederate States. He was convicted on both charges,
                        and was sentenced to imprisonment at Fort Jefferson, Fla., or at such other
                        place as the commanding general should direct, for five years. The sentence
                        was approved by General Canby, commanding, and the claimant was committed to
                        confinement at Fort Jefferson, where he remained for about nine months, when
                        he was pardoned by the President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The questions involved and the doctrines maintained by the respective counsel
                        in the case of Miss Hill were urged upon the commission in this case. The
                        counsel for the claimant further contended that the dealing in bonds of the
                        enemy in New Orleans and transmitting them thence to England for sale was
                        not a “relieving of the enemy with money,” or in any manner a giving of aid
                        to the enemy, and that the correspondence of the claimant with Violett
                        involved no aid or comfort to the enemy, gave no information to them, and
                        constituted no military offence. He cited the first article of the treaty
                        between the United States and Great Britain of 3d July, 1865, (8 Stat, at
                        L.;) also Milligan’s case, (4 Wall., 2;) Egan’s case, (5 Blatchford, C. C.
                        R., 320;) the Venus, (2 Wall., 259;) the Circassian, (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>The memorial claimed $500,000 damages. The claim was disallowed by the
                        commission, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                    <p>In the case of James McVey, No. 208, the claimant alleged that he was twice
                        arrested. It appeared that the first arrest was within the enemy’s lines,
                        when he was detained for some four weeks to prevent his communication with
                        the enemy. The second time he was arrested while in the act of carrying
                        goods across the lines from the enemy’s country, and was held in confinement
                        several weeks. His claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>Substantially similar to this last case, in regard to the character of the
                        arrest, were the cases of Isaac Milner, No. 207, in which an award <pb
                            n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0134"/>was made in favor of the claimant for
                        property, but including nothing for the alleged arrest; of Samuel Simpson,
                        No. 217, which was unanimously disallowed; of John Carew, No. 224, which was
                        disallowed, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting; of Henry F. White, No. 233,
                        which was unanimously disallowed; and of John Gale, No. 247, in which there
                        was an award for property, but including nothing on account of the arrest or
                        imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Joseph W. Scott, No. 226, the claimant, domiciled at
                        Jacksonville, Fla., was there arrested by order of the commanding officer in
                        November, 1864, on the charge of disloyalty, and detained in confinement for
                        some three months. Jacksonville was an inland town, on the Saint John’s
                        River, which came into the hands of the United States forces in February,
                        1864, and from that time to the close of the war was occupied by them; but
                        the rebel forces, most of the time, were within its immediate vicinity.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was insisted that the military commander
                        was necessarily invested with absolute power for the control of the city;
                        and that it was his duty to take such measures as should prevent inhabitants
                        disloyally disposed from communicating with the enemy; and that nothing in
                        the case of Mr. Scott showed an abuse of this authority.</p>
                    <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant in respect of property taken by
                        the United States troops, but it included nothing for imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>In the case of James T. Munroe, No. 235, claimant had embarked at New Orleans
                        in August, 1864, on board a steamer for Matamoras, Mexico, with the
                        machinery for erecting a saw-mill at that place. The steamer was stopped at
                        Fort Jackson on the charge of having contraband goods on board intended for
                        Texas, brought back to New Orleans, and the claimant was there detained by
                        the military authorities for two days on board the steamer, and for twelve
                        hours in the military prison at that city. It appeared that, while he was in
                        confinement, his trunk onboard the steamer was broken open, either by the
                        provost-guard or in consequence of their negligence, and money, wearing
                        apparel, and other articles were stolen from it. On complaint made to
                        Major-General Canby, in command of the city, an order was made by him
                        declaring these transactions, if true, to be exceedingly discreditable to
                        the guards, and directing the provost-marshal to take measures to bring the
                        offenders to justice. An investigation was ordered, but the offenders did
                        not appear to have been discovered, and no reparation was made to the
                        claimant.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was urged that the arrest and detention
                        were lawful and reasonable for the purpose of inquiry as to the character of
                        the vessel, and that the United States were not liable to reclamation for
                        the theft of the claimant’s property.</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0135"/>
                    <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant for $1,540, in which all the
                        commissioners joined.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Susan B. Jackson, No. 255, the claimant, in behalf of herself
                        and her four minor children, claimed damages for the arrest of John Jackson,
                        the husband of the claimant, at Knoxville, Tenn., and his banishment within
                        the enemy’s lines, with his family, in January, 1864. It appeared that Dr.
                        Jackson, the husband, had been a resident of Knoxville for some years and
                        until after the breaking out of the war; that he had sent his family to
                        England in August, 1861, and himself followed them in June, 1862; that he
                        returned to New York in October, 1862, and in January, 1863, having obtained
                        the proper permission, returned to Knoxville for the alleged purpose of
                        disposing of his property there. Instead of disposing of his property he
                        remained at Knoxville, and there entered into trade. Both before his
                        departure for England and after his return, in 1863, he had been an open and
                        active sympathizer with the rebellion, denouncing the United States
                        Government and encouraging and aiding the rebels down to the surrender of
                        Knoxville to the United States forces in September, 1863. Evidence was also
                        given on the part of the United States showing conduct evincing a hostile
                        spirit toward the United States Government. On the 29th January, 1864, the
                        following notice was addressed to him by General Foster’s provost-marshal:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Owing to your persistent disloyalty to the Government of the United
                                States, it has been decided to send you and your family south of the
                                Federal lines. You will, therefore, be prepared to start on
                                receiving further notice.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The further notice was served on the 30th January, requiring him to be ready
                        to depart on the 3d February, on which day Jackson and his family were sent
                        through the rebel lines under a flag of truce.</p>
                    <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant in respect of property of her own
                        appropriated to the use of the United States, but including nothing by
                        reason of the arrest and banishment complained of.</p>
                    <p>Joseph M. P. Nolan, No. 272, was arrested by the military provost-marshal at
                        Saint Louis, Mo., in October, 1861, on the charge of disloyalty to the
                        United States, and of having written a letter to an alleged enemy of the
                        United States in Canada, giving information as to military movements. He was
                        detained in prison at Saint Louis till June, 1862, then transferred to the
                        military prison at Alton, Ill., and there detained till August, 1863, when
                        he was finally discharged. His release was offered him in December, 1861,
                        and on one or two other occasions, on his giving his parole to do no act
                        unfriendly to the United States. This parole he refused to give. Great and
                        unnecessary hardships in connection with his confinement were alleged on the
                        part of the claimant; and the proof conclusively showed that the prison in
                        which he was confined at Alton was wholly unfit in its appointments and
                        sanitary <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0136"/>condition for the
                        confinement of prisoners, especially for the large number there confined;
                        and that at times the treatment of the prisoners, including the claimant,
                        was harsh and cruel.</p>
                    <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant for $8,600, all the commission
                        joining. I am advised that the majority of the commission, at least, held
                        the original arrest of the claimant and his reasonable detention justified;
                        but that his long confinement and improper treatment during it were not
                        justified.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Mary Nolan, No. 273, the claimant alleged that she was
                        arrested at Saint Louis by a detective in the employ of the United States
                        authorities in September, 1864; taken before the provost-marshal at Saint
                        Louis, and committed by him to the Chestnut-street prison, where she was
                        detained for an entire day; and that she was there subjected to improper
                        treatment. She claimed damages $10,000. The evidence in her case showed that
                        she was brought before the provost-marshal, apparently upon a subpoena, to
                        testify in a case before him; that she refused to testify, and defied and
                        insulted the officer, who committed her to the city prison, where she was
                        detained for nine or ten hours. Her allegations of improper treatment were
                        not sustained. The commission unanimously disallowed her claim.</p>
                    <p>In the case of John F. Parr, No. 285, the claimant, a resident of Nash ville,
                        Tenn., then in possession of the rebel forces, passed through the lines into
                        Indiana, and thence to Buffalo, N. Y., in October, 1861. He went thence to
                        New York City, where he bought some clothing, shoes, medicines, and other
                        goods, and returned thence to Buffalo, where he was arrested immediately on
                        his arrival, on the 20th of October; he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New
                        York Harbor, there confined for about four months, and was finally
                        discharged in February, 1862, without a trial.</p>
                    <p>An award was made in his favor for $4,800, in which all the commissioners
                        joined. I am advised that the award proceeded on the ground that though his
                        original arrest and reasonable detention were lawful, his detention for four
                        months without trial was held not justified.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Richard Hall, No. 318, the claimant was arrested in Maryland,
                        on the 8th of March, 1864; was brought before a military commission on the
                        charge of having unlawfully passed from the loyal States through the Federal
                        and confederate military lines into the State of Virginia, and there held
                        illegal intercourse with the enemies of the United States, and then returned
                        through the lines in the same manner. The military commission found him
                        guilty of the offence charged, and sentenced him to imprisonment in Fort
                        McHenry, Maryland, for the term of four months, and to pay a fine of $8,000,
                        and to be imprisoned until the fine should be paid. He was accordingly
                        imprisoned for the four months, and for twenty days thereafter, when he paid
                        the $8,000 and was released.</p>
                    <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0137"/>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was alleged that his visit to Virginia was
                        without unlawful intent and for innocent and social purposes. This
                        allegation was answered on the part of the United States by proof that ‘the
                        claimant took orders from the confederate military authorities at Richmond
                        for military supplies, which he undertook to purchase for them, and that he
                        returned through the lines with the purpose of executing such orders. The
                        counsel for the claimant claimed that the military commission was without
                        jurisdiction, citing the case of Milligan, (4 Wall., 2.) The counsel of the
                        United States claimed that the offence was purely a military one and
                        cognizable by the military tribunals under the Articles of War.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made an award in favor of
                        the claimant for $2,984. I am advised that this amount was made up of the
                        sum of $5,000, part of the fine of $6,000 imposed, which the commission
                        deemed excessive, reduced from United States currency in which it was paid
                        to gold, and interest added to make up the amount of the award.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Llewellyn Crowther, No. 362, the claimant was arrested in
                        Baltimore in July, 1863, taken before Colonel Fish, then provost marshal
                        there, and detained in confinement at the Gil more House for about’ eight
                        hours. The arrest grew out of a quarrel between the claimant and two other
                        persons at a hotel in Baltimore, of which complaint was made to Colonel
                        Fish, and the claimant was charged with using seditious and disloyal
                        language. He alleged that Colonel Fish, on the arraignment of the claimant
                        before him, used language abusively and indecently violent toward him and
                        toward his country and Queen. He claimed damages $10,000, and the commission
                        unanimously awarded him the sum of $100.</p>
                    <p>In the case of John M. Vernon, No. 364, the claimant alleged that he had
                        always been domiciled in England, the country of his nativity. It appeared,
                        however, that he had resided in the United States most of the time since
                        1849, and had been there engaged in trade. He was in Europe at the breaking
                        out of the war, but returned to the United States in June, 1861, and thence
                        passed into the confederacy, remaining there, with the exception of a
                        temporary absence in the latter part of 1861, till January, 1863.</p>
                    <p>He alleged that he had always maintained his neutrality between the United
                        States and the confederate government$ that in January, 1863, he sailed from
                        the port of Charleston in the steamer Huntress, owned by himself and laden
                        with cotton, principally owned by himself, for Nassau, N. P.; succeeded in
                        passing out through the blockade, but on the day after his departure, and
                        upon the high seas between Charleston and Nassau, the steamer took fire and
                        was destroyed, the claimant with the master and crew escaping in two ship’s
                        boats. These boats were picked up by a <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0138"
                        />United States war-vessel on the ocean, on the 18th January, and the
                        claimant was carried to Hilton Head, S. C., there transferred to another
                        vessel, carried to New York, examined before the United States marshal
                        there, and committed to Fort Lafayette, in New York Harbor, in which fort,
                        and afterwards in Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, he was kept confined till
                        October, 1865, when he was released upon his written pledge that he would
                        “sail from Boston, Mass., by the earliest opportunity, and leave the United
                        States of America, not to return without the special permission of the
                        President thereof.”</p>
                    <p>He alleged large losses resulting from his imprisonment, by the waste and
                        destruction of his property in the Southern States during his imprisonment,
                        and in consequence of his business being deprived of his personal attention;
                        and claimed damages, in all, to the amount of £338,133.</p>
                    <p>The proofs on the part of the United States showed that, up to his departure
                        from Charleston, in July, 1863, he had been largely and actively engaged in
                        rendering aid to the confederate government in its war against the United
                        States; that he individually, and as a partner in the firms of Vernon &amp;
                        Co., and Vernon, James &amp; Co., had entered into large contracts with the
                        confederate government for the supply of arms, ammunition, and military
                        supplies, including twelve large rifled cannon, and large quantities of
                        gun-barrels; rifles, pistols, powder, army clothing, shoes, blankets,
                        &amp;c.; that he had been engaged in the manufacture of arms during the war,
                        at Wilmington, N. C., for the benefit of the confederate government. At the
                        time of his capture some of his contracts were found upon him: these
                        contracts also granting to his firm, on the part of the confederate
                        government, certain privileges of purchasing cotton and tobacco, and
                        transporting the same without hindrance, and exporting them to all ports
                        except those of the United States, with convoy if desired. Correspondence
                        ensued between Lord Lyons, Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, and Mr.
                        Seward, the Secretary of State of the United States; and upon submission to
                        Her Majesty’s legation of the proofs found upon the person of the claimant
                        further intervention in his behalf was declined.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart, then Her Majesty’s acting minister at Washington, on the 23d
                        September, 1863, addressed to Mr. Vernon the following letter: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inform you, in reply to your
                                letter of the 19th instant, that I lately received a dispatch from
                                Earl Russell, stating that your case had been fully considered by
                                Her Majesty’s government in communication with the law advisers of
                                the Crown.</p>
                            <p>It appears to Her Majesty’s government, judging by the evidence
                                produced, that you are a born British subject, and it does not
                                appear that you have obtained naturalization in the United States,
                                or exercised political privileges as a citizen.</p>
                            <p>But taking other circumstances into consideration, and more
                                particularly that you have identified yourself in the strongest
                                manner with the fortunes of the so-called Confederate States, and
                                that you were, when taken, actually engaged in rendering material
                                assistance to the government of these States, although deriving a
                                commercial profit from so doing, Her Majesty’s government are of
                                opinion that the United States Government are justified in treating
                                you as a <hi rend="italic">de fcato</hi> belligerent.</p>
                            <p>The evidence, moreover, shows that although, during as residence of
                                twenty-three <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0139"/>years in the
                                Southern States, you paid occasional visits to England, you had no
                                intention of returning to permanent residence in your native
                                country, and that, you were practically and <hi rend="italic">de
                                    facto</hi> a willing citizen of the Confederate States, engaged
                                in equipping their army.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government, therefore, consider, under the
                                circumstances, your release cannot be claimed as a matter of right
                                merely because you were born a British subject, but Earl Russell
                                desires that Her Majesty’s legation should, nevertheless, endeavor
                                to persuade the United States Government to mitigate or shorten your
                                captivity.</p>
                            <p>I accordingly represented to the Secretary of State, on the 10th
                                instant, that it would be a gratification to Her Majesty’s
                                government to learn that your captivity had been mitigated or
                                shortened through the clemency of the United States Government, and
                                your case is consequently again under consideration.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>From that time forth Her Majesty’s government uniformly and consistently
                        declined any international interference for the protection of Mr. Vernon,
                        and disclaimed all pretence of right to intervene in his behalf. Sir
                        Frederick Bruce, then Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, as late as 24th
                        October, 1865, said in a letter to Mr. Vernon, in response to an application
                        from him: “My instructions prohibit my interfering in your behalf.”</p>
                    <p>A labored argument was filed on behalf of the claimant, by which it was
                        contended that the imprisonment of the claimant without trial was utterly
                        unjustifiable; that it was prolonged in a manner never contemplated by the
                        British authorities; that while under restraint his treatment was
                        indefensible, and that the order of banishment from the United States, and
                        the subsequent refusal to revoke it, were outrages against all law and
                        justice. That the decision of Her Majesty’s government, justifying the
                        treatment of the claimant by the United States Government as a <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> belligerent, was erroneous; that the
                        condition of the claimant, at the time of his capture, was that of a neutral
                        alien engaged in commercial transactions only with the confederate
                        government, and that such transactions were not criminal and did not deprive
                        him of his neutral character. That even if he had previously been an enemy
                        by domicile., he had, when he embarked from Charleston on the Huntress, left
                        the country of his former domicile without the intention of returning, and
                        his native domicile, native allegiance, and native <hi rend="italic"
                            >status</hi> had thereupon instantly reverted to him, and that the
                        decision of Her Majesty’s government, justifying his detention by the United
                        States, and refusing to intervene in his behalf, could not be taken as
                        prejudicing the claimant’s individual right to reclamation under, the rules
                        of international law. The counsel for the claimant cited, in support of
                        these propositions, the following authorities: 4 Blackstone’s Com., 76;

                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>In the case of William B. Forwood, No. 394, the claimant, a British subject,
                        domiciled in England, in October, 1861, landed at New York from the steamer
                        City of Washington from Queenstown. He was arrested immediately on landing
                        from the steamer, on information that he had, both in Liverpool and on board
                        the steamer upon his passage, expressed himself as a warm friend of the
                        rebellion, and that he was connected with a firm engaged in running the
                        blockade and upon the suspicion that his visit to New York was for the
                        purpose of promoting correspondence with the enemy. He was detained at the
                        office of the chief of police in New York for some three or four hours, his
                        person and baggage examined, and he was then discharged. He claimed, as
                        damages for his arrest, £5,000. The commission disallowed his claim, Mr.
                        Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                    <p>In the cases of Stephen Jarman, No. 418; Robert Bowden, No. 419; Samuel
                        Joseph Redgate, No. 420; and John Henry Ellsworth, No. 421; the claimants
                        were respectively the master and passengers on the British steamship
                        Peterhoff, captured as prize of war by the United States steamer Vanderbilt,
                        near the Island of St. Thomas, in February, 1863. The case of the Peterhoff
                        will be more fully reported under a subsequent head. Bowden, Red gate, and
                        Ellsworth were respectively in charge of portions of the cargo of the
                        Peterhoff, either as owners or consignees, or as agents for owners or
                        consignees. The Peterhoff was taken, on her capture, first to Key West and
                        thence to New York, where she was libelled in the United States district
                        court. Jarman, Bowden, and Redgate were taken with the vessel to New York,
                        and detained till their depositions, <hi rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi>,
                        were taken, when they were discharged. Ellsworth was discharged at Key West,
                        without being taken to New York or examined as a witness. He was detained on
                        board the Peterhoff from her capture, 25th February, till the 25th March,
                        eighteen days after her arrival at Key West. Jarman, Bowden, and Redgate
                        were examined as witnesses in New York on the 1st day of April, the fourth
                        day after the arrival of the Peterhoff in New York <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85"
                            facs="0141"/>Harbor, and were respectively discharged immediately after
                        their examination.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimants, respectively, it was contended that the capture
                        of the Peterhoff was unlawful, and the detention of these claimants,
                        respectively, was likewise unwarranted by prize law.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the Peterhoff was
                        rightfully captured on justifiable cause, and that the detention of these
                        claimants as witnesses was warranted by the law and practice of the prize
                        courts; and that as to Ellsworth, his release at Key West without
                        examination as a witnesss, and without being taken to New York where the
                        vessel was libelled, could not be considered as an aggravation of his
                        imprisonment, nor as giving him any right of reclamation, which he would not
                        have had if taken to New York and examined as a witness, as he lawfully
                        might have been.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                    <p>The case of Philip George Beaumont Dean, No. 465, was of like character with
                        the four last named. The claimant was captured on board the British brig
                        Dashing Wave, (whose case will be hereafter reported,) off the mouth of the
                        Rio Grande River, in November, 1863. He was rated as an able seaman on the
                        brig, though in fact a passenger and a son of one of the owners of the brig.
                        He was taken with the vessel to New Orleans, where the vessel was libelled;
                        was examined as a witness <hi rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi> 28th
                        November, 1863, six days after the arrival of the vessel at New Orleans, and
                        was then released. His memorial alleged that from that time till the 23d
                        July, 1864, he was “detained on parole by the commissioners of the United
                        States Government” at New Orleans, but his evidence showed no such detention
                        or parole, and it appeared that his stay in New Orleans after his
                        examination was a voluntary one, for the purpose of looking after the
                        interests of the owners of the vessel, and cargo.</p>
                    <p>His claim was unanimously disallowed by the commission.</p>
                    <p>In the case of George F. Cauty, No. 443, the claimant was a British subject,
                        for several years domiciled in Central America, but from March to December,
                        1863, temporarily resident in the city of New York, engaged, as he alleged,
                        in commercial enterprises connected with Central America. He was arrested in
                        New York by the United States military authorities on the eve of his
                        departure for Nicaragua by steamer, 24th December, 1863; detained in a
                        prison in the city of New York for three days, then transferred to Fort
                        Lafayette, and there confined till the 14th March, 1864, when he was
                        discharged without trial and without information of the grounds of his
                        arrest, except the general statement that he had been engaged in aiding the
                        enemies of the United States, or violating the neutrality laws and
                        regulations. It appeared that he was arrested in company with one Dr. Segur,
                        in connection with whom he had been <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0142"
                        />engaged in purchasing arms, as was alleged by them, for the state of San
                        Salvador, and that the circumstances of the purchase and shipment of these
                        arms were such as to lead to the strong suspicion that they were in fact
                        purchased and shipped for the use of the confederate government. Shortly
                        after his arrest he was brought before a military commission at New York and
                        interrogated as to his connection with Dr. Segur, and purchase of arms made
                        by him. Most of these questions he refused to answer, on the ground that he
                        had “been advised not to compromise himself or his friends in any shape or
                        manner.” He was thereupon remanded to prison. The charge that the arms were
                        in any way designed to aid the enemies of the United States was not
                        sustained by the proofs. The claimant alleged large pecuniary losses
                        resulting from his imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>The commission made an award in his favor for $15,700, Mr. Commissioner
                        Frazer dissenting on the question of amount.</p>
                    <p>John Tovell, No. 446, a Baptist clergyman, was arrested at Nashville, Term.,
                        on the 9th November, 1862, on the charge of disloyalty to the United States,
                        and of having in the course of a funeral oration delivered at Nashville used
                        language strongly denunciatory of the military authorities in charge of
                        Nashville, and tending to incite disaffection and rebellion. Nashville was a
                        town within the insurrectionary states, captured by the United States in the
                        spring of 1862, and held by them as a military post and under military
                        government at the time of the claimant’s arrest. He was detained in prison
                        till the 8th June, 1863, and then banished into the confederate lines.</p>
                    <p>The commission awarded him $830, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>
                    <p>Henry E. Smith, No. 461, a physician, domiciled at Louisville, Ky., within a
                        State not in rebellion, was arrested at that place by the military
                        authorities of the United States, in July, 1864, on a charge of circulating
                        treasonable documents, the documents in question being copies of a
                        handsomely printed placard highly laudatory of the confederate General
                        Robert E. Lee, as a patriot, Christian, and hero of unfaltering devotion to
                        duty, &amp;c. Louisville and the State in which it was situaedt contained a
                        large proportion of sympathizers with the rebellion; and it was contended on
                        the part of the United States that the circulation of this document by Dr.
                        Smith was made with the direct purpose and intent of giving aid to the rebel
                        “cause $ that it was calculated to give such aid, and that his, imprisonment
                        and detention were lawful military acts The claimant was imprisoned for
                        about fourteen weeks, and was then discharged without trial.</p>
                    <p>The commission gave an award for $1,540, Mr. Commissioner Frazer

                    <p>Robert McKeown, No. 463, was in March, 1863, while employed as a
                        ship-carpenter in the service of the United States Government on board the
                        gunboat Benton, on the Mississippi, River, near the mouth of the Yazoo,
                        arrested by the commanding officer of the gun-boat, confined in the hold for
                        about four days, then transferred to another gun-boat, and taken to Cairo,
                        Ill., where he was discharged on the 5th April, after a confinement, in all,
                        of thirteen days He alleged improper treatment during his confinement,
                        inconsequence of which his health was materially injured. His arrest was
                        upon the charge of disloyal and seditious language against the United States
                        while employed on board the gunboat.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously made an award in his favor for $1,467.</p>

                    <p>These claims related to vessels and their cargoes captured as prize by the
                        United States during the war, and libelled in the prize-courts of the United
                        States. In a portion of them final sentence of condemnation of the vessel or
                        cargo, or both, was given by the courts of the United States, and the claim
                        was now brought for the alleged value of such vessels and cargoes, alleging
                        the condemnation to have been wrongful. In the other cases judgment of
                        restitution was given by the courts, and the claim was now brought for
                        damages by reason of the alleged wrongful capture and detention, and for
                        costs and expenses incurred in respect of the same.</p>
                    <p>The whole number of memorials filed by different claimants for such captures
                        was seventy-six, some of the memorials covering claims for several different
                        vessels, as in the case of Sanders &amp; Sons, No. 281, in which damages
                        were claimed for the capture and condemnation of twenty seven vessels.</p>
                    <p>The whole number of vessels captured, in respect of which and their cargoes
                        claims were interposed, was seventy, in some instances many claims of
                        different alleged owners being interposed in respect of the same vessel and
                        her cargo, as in the case of the Peterhoff, in regard to which, and
                        different portions of her cargo, twenty-two memorials were filed.</p>
                    <p>In respect of the capture of six of these vessels and their cargoes, or
                        portions of the same, awards of greater or less amount were made against the
                        United States.</p>

                    <p>The whole amount of the allowances, in respect of the six vessels as to which

                    <p>The question was early raised, on the part of the United States, as to the
                        jurisdiction of these prize cases by the commission, both in respect to
                        cases where the decision of the ultimate appellate tribunal of the United
                        States had been had, and to those in which no appeal had been prosecuted on
                        the part of the claimants to such ultimate tribunal. As to the former class
                        of cases, the undersigned may properly state that he personally entertained
                        no doubt of the jurisdiction of the commission, as an international
                        tribunal, to review the decisions of the prize-courts of the United States,
                        where the patties alleging themselves aggrieved had prosecuted their claims
                        by appeal to the court of last resort. As this jurisdiction, however, had
                        been sometimes questioned, he deemed it desirable that a formal adjudication
                        by the commission should be had upon this question. The commission
                        unanimously sustained their jurisdiction in this class of cases, and, as
                        will be seen, all the members of the commission at some time joined in
                        awards against the United States in such cases.</p>
                    <p>The question as to the jurisdiction of the commission in cases where the
                        party complaining had failed to prosecute his appeal from the prize court of
                        original jurisdiction to the court of ultimate appellate jurisdiction, was
                        raised by demurrer in several cases, and was argued at length in the case of
                        the British brig Napier, Ryerson and others, claimants, No. 147. In that
                        case the vessel was captured as prize in July, 1862, by a United States
                        vessel of war near the mouth of the Gape Fear River, on which river is
                        situated the port of Wilmington, in North Carolina, a blockaded port. She
                        had sailed from Turk’s Island, one of the Bahamas, with a cargo of salt, on
                        a voyage alleged to have been destined for the port of Beaufort, N. C., then
                        not blockaded, but in possession of the United States forces. She was taken
                        by the captors to the port of Philadelphia, and there libelled in the United
                        States district court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, on the
                        charge of attempting and intending to violate the blockade of the port of
                        Wilmington, or other blockaded port in the insurrectionary States, and was
                        condemned by that court as lawful prize, and sold under the decree. The
                        vessel belonged to the port of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and was owned by
                        British subjects there resident. No appeal appeared to have been taken from
                        the decision of the district court by which the vessel was condemned. The
                        memorial contained a general averment that neither the vessel nor cargo was
                        “liable to confiscation” under the law of nations or the laws of the United
                        States. A demurrer was interposed on behalf of the United States,
                        specifying, among other grounds of demurrer, the following: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>That the memorial does not show any appeal taken from the judgment of
                                said court to the appellate tribunals of the United States having
                                appellate jurisdiction thereof; and does not show that the remedy of
                                the claimants for their alleged grievance under the laws of the
                                United States had been sought or pursued to or in the judicial
                                tribunal of the United States having ultimate appellate jurisdiction
                                of the said matter.</p>

                    <p>On the argument of this case on demurrer, it was contended, on the part of
                        the United States, that until the claimant has exhausted his remedy by
                        appeal, and finds himself still aggrieved by the judicial tribunal of last
                        resort, he has no ground of reclamation against the United States as the
                        workers of injustice against him. That it is only in the event of final
                        failure of justice, after pursuit of all the regular and ordinary means of
                        redress, that any adjudication is to be considered as working wrong against
                        a foreign litigant so as to entitle him to reclamation through the
                        intervention of his own government. That the litigant who stops short of
                        this and submits to the judgment of the inferior court, without seeking a
                        review and reversal of such judgment by the appellate tribunal, in effect
                        concedes the correctness of the judgment to which he submits. The counsel
                        for the United States cited the report of Mr. Murray, (afterwards Lord
                        Mansfield,) 1753, upon the reprisals made by the King of Prussia upon the
                        Silesian Loan; Wheaton’s History of the Law of Nations, pp. 210, 211; Wild
                        man’s Institutes, vol. 1, pp. 353, 354; Rutherforth’s Institutes, vol. 2,
                        pp. 596–7–8–9; the Opinions of Dr. Nicholl and Mr. Pinkney in the case of
                        the Betsy, before the commission under the seventh article of the treaty of
                        13th November, 1794, between the United States and Great Britain. (Wheaton’s
                        Life of Pinkney, pp. 193 to 276.)</p>
                    <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel, on behalf of the claimants in this and other
                        cases, maintained that the doctrines of the publicists in regard to the
                        necessity of a party aggrieved following out his complete remedy in the
                        appellate prize courts of the nation of whose acts he complained, applied
                        only to the question as to grounds of war and reprisals, and did not apply
                        to the question of jurisdiction by an international tribunal, established by
                        treaty, with the large powers and jurisdiction conferred by the treaty upon
                        this commission. That under the terms of the treaty the commission had
                        jurisdiction of all wrongful acts committed by the authorities of the United
                        States upon the persons or property of British subjects; that the case of
                        the claimant here was founded, not on an alleged denial of justice, but on
                        an act alleged to be in violation of the law of nations, to wit, the
                        wrongful capture of the claimant’s vessel, which act had been adopted by the
                        United States, whose armed force committed the wrong, and of which wrongful
                        act the United States had received the benefit. He cited Dana’s Wheaton, §
                        292; Grotius, book 3, c. 2, §§ 4, 5; Wildman, vol. 1, p. 197; the treaty
                        between the United States and Great Britain of 1794, (8 Stat, at L., 121,)
                        and the case of the bark Jones, before the commission under the convention
                        of 1853 between the United States and Great Britain. (Report of that
                        commission, p. 83.)</p>
                    <p>The commission held, in effect, that, under the treaty, they had
                        jurisdiction, notwithstanding the failure of the claimant to pursue his
                        remedy by appeal to the court of last resort; but that such failure on his
                        part would be considered conclusive against him, unless satisfactory reasons
                            <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0146"/>were given for the omission to
                        appeal. It was thereupon unanimously ordered by the commission that the
                        demurrers be overruled, but that the claimants, in all the prize cases in
                        which appeals had not been taken and pursued to the court of last resort,
                        should file with the commission their reasons for such omissions or failures
                        to take and prosecute such appeals.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently the claimants in this case filed an affidavit, assigning as
                        their reasons for not appealing from the decree of the district court the
                        following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>1st. Because it was universally known in Philadelphia at the time
                                said decree passed that appeals from the prize courts there by
                                claimants were almost uniformly confirmed with costs. 2d. That
                                public opinion there was in sympathy with such confirmations, under
                                the suspicion that commercial men in this province (Nova Scotia)
                                were in sympathy with the confederates. 3d. That the other owners of
                                the Napier were not of pecuniary ability to procure the necessary
                                sureties without much inconvenience, nor to sustain further heavy
                                costs, and the burden of loss added to injury, especially as we had
                                already expended nearly $500 in counsel fees, agency, and travelling
                                expenses connected with this seizure.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>On the filing of these “reasons” the commission, without further argument,
                        held them insufficient to excuse the want of appeal, and unanimously
                        disallowed the claim. On the decision of the original question Mr.
                        Commissioner Frazer read an opinion which will be found in the appendix,
                        L.</p>
                    <p>Under the order for claimants in cases in which no appeal had been taken to
                        file their reasons for non-appeal, such reasons were filed and passed upon
                        in the following cases:</p>
                    <p>John W. Carmalt, No. 89, claimant for part of the cargo of the ship Amelia,
                        captured and condemned by the United States, alleged, as his excuse for
                        non-appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, that the claimant,
                        being then within the State of South Carolina, then at war with the United
                        States, was unable to communicate with counsel in Philadelphia, where the
                        vessel was libelled, or to take any measures for prosecuting such appeal on
                        account of the war then raging.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) held these reasons
                        sufficient; but subsequently, on the hearing on the merits, unanimously
                        disallowed the claimant’s claim, it appearing that he was at the time of the
                        alleged capture domiciled within the Confederate States, and his property,
                        therefore, liable to capture on the high seas as enemy’s property.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the brig Ariel, R. M. Carson, claimant, No. 178, the reason
                        assigned for non-appeal was that the claimant had never been aware, until
                        the filing of the demurrer to his memorial before the commission, “that
                        there could have been any appeal from the decision of the United States
                        prize court that condemned the vessel and cargo.”</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim, on the ground of the
                        insufficiency of this reason.</p>
                    <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0147"/>
                    <p>In the case of the schooner Argonaut, Joseph B. Hey cock, administrator, No.
                        263, and Frederick Wm. Ruggles, No. 264, Claimants, the reasons for
                        non-appeal assigned were that the counsel consulted by the claimants advised
                        them that there was no necessity for taking such appeal, unless they
                        intended to commence a suit in a civil court for damages, and that such
                        claims, arising during the war, would, without doubt, be ultimately made the
                        subject of arbitration, on which advice the claimants acted, and so omitted
                        to appeal.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim on the ground of the
                        insufficiency of the reasons.</p>
                    <p>In the cases of the brig Sarah Starr and the schooner Aigburth, Cowlam
                        Graveley, claimant, No. 292, the reasons assigned for non-appeal were that
                        the claimant had become impoverished by his losses during the war, and the
                        expenses of prosecuting his claims in the prize-court of original
                        jurisdiction, and was unable to incur further expense; and also that he was
                        advised that in the excited state of the country, and in view of the tenor
                        of other decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, he would not
                        be likely to obtain impartial justice by such appeal.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim for insufficiency of the
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the schooner Prince Leopold, Henry A. McLeod, claimant, No.
                        306, the claimant assigned as reasons for his failure to appeal, his poverty
                        and consequent inability to meet the drafts of his proctor and counsel in
                        New York, and his expectation that his proctor would prosecute the appeal at
                        his own expense, of the failure of which expectation he was not advised in
                        season to secure the services of another lawyer on those terms.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously held the reasons insufficient, and disallowed the
                        claims.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the M. S. Perry, otherwise known as the “Salvor,” John
                        McLennan, claimant, No. 370, the claimant alleged as reasons for non-appeal
                        that the case of the vessel was hurried through the prize-court so rapidly
                        that he, residing in Havana, had no opportunity to interpose any claim or
                        defense; that he was advised by letter from Lord Lyons, Her Majesty’s
                        minister at Washington, that he would have full opportunity to defend, but
                        that subsequently it appeared that the vessel and cargo had been condemned
                        and sold some days before this letter was written, and that, though he
                        attempted by correspondence to secure a defence of his rights, all such
                        efforts proved futile and unavailing.</p>
                    <p>The commission accepted these reasons as sufficient, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                        dissenting, and directed the case to be heard on its merits. On final
                        hearing the claim was disallowed, as will hereafter appear.</p>
                    <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0148"/>
                    <p>In the ease of the ship Will-o’-the-wisp, J. G. A. Creighton and others,
                        claimants, No. 378, the reasons assigned for non-appeal were, in substance,
                        that they did not know the case was appealable, and that they supposed that
                        their proper appeal was to their own government.</p>
                    <p>The reasons were held insufficient, and the claim disallowed, Mr.
                        Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the brig Minnie, Wm. H. Fisher, claimant, No. 379, the reasons
                        for non-appeal were substantially the same as alleged in the case of the
                        Ariel, No. 178, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim for the insufficiency of the
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>In the case, of the schooner Adelso, Henry Horton, claimant, No. 437, the
                        claimant assigned as his reasons for non-appeal, his poverty and his
                        apprehensions of the danger of investing more money in law expenses.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously adjudged the reasons insufficient, and disallowed
                        the claim.</p>
                    <p>The above were the only cases in which the sufficiency of the reasons
                        assigned for non-appeal were specifically passed upon by the commission. In
                        several other cases reasons for non-appeal were filed, but were not passed
                        upon by the commission before the final disposition of the cases upon the
                        merits.</p>
                    <p>The action of the commission upon those cases, respectively, will appear in
                        the following notes, under the heads of the respective vessels.</p>
                    <p>It maybe stated generally, that although in two or three cases, as above
                        noted, the commission expressly held the excuse for non-appeal to be
                        sufficient to entertain jurisdiction of the claim upon the merits, and
                        although in other cases the commission did not expressly disallow the claim
                        on the ground of the insufficiency of the reasons for non-appeal, no award
                        was made against the United States in any case in which the claimants had
                        not pursued their remedy in the prize courts of the United States by appeal
                        to the court of last resort. I am advised that Mr. Commissioner Frazer was
                        of opinion that nothing short of the misfeasance or default of the capturing
                        Government, by means of which an appeal was prevented, was sufficient to
                        excuse the failure to appeal, and that in accordance with this view he held
                        the reasons assigned in every case before the ‘commission to be
                        insufficient.</p>
                    <p>The following cases cover all the prize cases not disposed of by the rulings
                        of the commission on the question of non-appeal, as above stated:</p>
                    <p>The steamship Dolphin; Richard Henry Eustice, No. 166, claimant for part of
                        cargo and for wages, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured by a United States war-vessel while on a <pb n="93"
                            xml:id="pg_93" facs="0149"/>voyage from Liverpool, ostensibly to Nassau,
                        in the island of New Providence. She was taken into the port, of Key West,
                        and there libelled in the United States district court for the southern
                        district of Florida. A claim was interposed in that court on behalf of
                        William J. Grazebrooke, merchant of Liverpool, as the owner of the
                        vessel.</p>
                    <p>The memorial of the claimant here alleged that the prize court refused to
                        condemn the steamer as lawful prize, but she was, notwithstanding, with her
                        cargo, taken possession of by the United States Government, and no part
                        thereof ever returned to the owner. The proofs, however, showed that the
                        vessel and cargo were regularly condemned in the prize court, and that no
                        appeal was taken from the judgment of that court. Among her cargo were found
                        46 cases containing 920 rifles, and 20 cases containing 2,240 cavalry
                        swords, all entered upon her manifest under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                            >hardware</hi>. The proofs before the prize court satisfied Judge
                        Marvin, before whom the trial was had, that the ultimate destination of both
                        vessel and cargo was Charleston or Wilmington, both blockaded ports of the
                        Confederate States; and he accordingly decreed condemnation of both vessel
                        and cargo as lawful prize. The proofs in the prize court were not put in
                        evidence before the commission, and the claimant submitted his case upon his
                        own deposition, taken on notice, in the course of which he refused to answer
                        various pertinent questions propounded on cross-examination, touching his
                        experience as a blockade-runner, and his intentions in connection with the
                        voyage of the Dolphin.</p>
                    <p>No reasons for non-appeal were filed, the case having been disposed of on the
                        merits without waiting for such reasons.</p>
                    <p>The commission, without hearing any argument on the part of the United
                        States, unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The brig Isabella Thompson; James McDaniel, No. 168, claimant for vessel;
                        Nehemiah K. Clements, No. 167, claimant for cargo.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured in June, 1863, by a United States cruiser on her
                        return voyage from Nassau, New Providence, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where
                        she was owned, having been chartered by the owner, McDaniel, to William
                        Pryor &amp; Sons, of Halifax, agents of Sanders &amp; Sons, of Nassau, for a
                        voyage from Halifax to Nassau and back to Halifax. The claimant Clements in
                        his memorial alleged that the vessel was chartered by himself. The claimant
                        McDaniel in his memorial alleged that the charter was to Messrs. Wm. Pryor
                        &amp; Sons. The proofs in both cases showed that the charter, although in
                        form to Messrs. Pryor &amp; Sons, was taken by them as the agents of and for
                        the benefit of Messrs. Sanders &amp; Sons. She was taken by the captors into
                        the port of New York and there libelled in the United States district court.
                        Judgment of restitution was rendered in that court, but without costs or
                        damages to the claimants. (Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 377.) From so much of
                        the decree as refused costs and damages the claimants respectively appealed
                            <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0150"/>to the Supreme Court of the
                        United States, where the judgment of the district court was affirmed, the
                        supreme court saying that a case of probable cause was clearly made out, and
                        expressing doubt whether the vessel and cargo should not have been condemned
                        by the court below on the evidence before it. The case in the Supreme Court
                        is reported under the name of "The Thompson,” (3 Wallace Supreme Court
                        Reports, p. 155.) The evidence showed that the vessel had arrived at Nassau
                        from Halifax, and had discharged her outward cargo. She then took on board a
                        cargo of turpentine and cotton, the product of the insurrectionary States,
                        which she received in the harbor from on board another vessel, the Argyle,
                        which bad run the blockade from Wilmington, N. C., with this cargo, which
                        she discharged directly upon the Isabella Thompson, having hauled alongside
                        her.</p>
                    <p>The claimant Clements alleged in his memorial that he was the sole owner of
                        the cargo which was, purchased by him at Nassau; that he had made an
                        arrangement with Messrs. Martin &amp; Co., of Nassau, that they should have
                        one-half the cargo when they paid for the same, but that Martin &amp; Co.
                        had never paid for their half, but after the seizure and redelivery of the
                        cargo to the claimant, refused to pay for their one-half, and the claimant
                        thereby remained sole owner. In the course of the litigation in the prize
                        court this claimant had several times stated on oath that one-half the cargo
                        belonged to him and one-half to Messrs. Martin &amp; Co. In his testimony
                        before the commission he stated in effect that the cargo was shipped by
                        Messrs. Martin &amp; Co., on joint account, and that after restoration to
                        himself he settled with Martin &amp;Co., he paying all expenses, and on such
                        settlement it was agreed that he should be personally entitled to all
                        damages recovered from the United States Government. Martin &amp; Co. were
                        shown to have been actively engaged in blockade-running; and their letters
                        found on board the Isabella Thompson, to their correspondents at Halifax and
                        New York, sufficiently indicated that the cargo in question was run out by
                        the Argyle on joint account of themselves and the claimant Clements.</p>
                    <p>On cross-examination Clements refused to answer who constituted the firm of
                        Martin &amp; Co., and whether he was himself a member of that firm; whether
                        they had general authority to make purchases for and shipments to him, or
                        only special authority for particular purchases; whether they shipped goods
                        on his account to the blockaded ports of the insurrectionary States, or
                        purchased goods in those ports for him. He also refused to state more
                        particularly the terms of the contract or agreement by which he became the
                        owner of Martin &amp; Co.’s half of the cargo, and evaded the question
                        whether he ever paid for the cargo seized in the Isabella Thompson, and if
                        so, to whom, how much, and when. He admitted himself the owner of the
                        Argyle, the blockade-runner from which the Isabella Thompson received the
                        cargo in question.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the proofs <pb n="95"
                            xml:id="pg_95" facs="0151"/>before the prize court, especially as
                        supported by the testimony of the claimant Clements before the commission,
                        clearly established that as to the cargo there was not only ample probable
                        cause to justify the capture, but that the proof was ample for its
                        condemnation; that the cargo was never landed at Nassau, and certainly never
                        became a part of the common stock of that port, but was in the course of-a
                        continuous voyage from the blockaded port of Wilmington to Halifax, having
                        been merely trans-shipped from the Argyle to the Isabella Thompson, without
                        change of ownership or of original destination. That the evasive, uncandid,
                        and untruthful testimony of the claimant Clements when testifying in his own
                        behalf, and his refusal to answer on cross-examination legitimate and
                        pertinent questions, exposed his claim to every possible implication against
                        its merits. And that the only error committed by the prize court was in
                        adjudging restitution instead of condemnation of the cargo. That if the
                        seizure of the cargo was justifiable, the seizure and detention of the
                        vessel were also justifiable to the same extent, and that her owner could
                        sustain no claim for damages where the cargo was liable to condemnation or
                        probable cause was found for its seizure, or that of any part of it.</p>

                        officials, who sold it at a high price.” His memorial contained no other
                        allegations concerning the tobacco or its capture. On demurrer by the United

                    <p>The Pacifique was owned at Quebec, Canada East, where the claimant Lemieux
                        resided. She was chartered to the claimants Harvey &amp; Co. for a round
                        voyage from Saint John’s, Newfoundland, to a port in the West Indies; thence
                        to Cienfuegos, Cuba, and thence back to Saint John’s. She sailed from
                        Cienfuegos on the 12th March, 1863, on her alleged return voyage to
                        Newfoundland, upon which her proper course would have taken her along the
                        eastern shore of Florida. She was captured on the 27th March, 1863, by a
                        United States war-vessel, off the port of Saint Mark’s, in the Gulf of
                        Mexico, on the western shore of Florida, and <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96"
                            facs="0152"/>so near the blockaded ports of Cedar Keys and Saint Mark’s
                        as to raise what Judge Marvin called “a very strong and violent presumption”
                        in the mind of the capturing officer of a purpose to break the blockade. She
                        was taken into the port of Key West, and there libelled in the United States
                        district court. On the hearing before Judge Marvin judgment of restitution
                        of the vessel and cargo was awarded on payment to the marshal of the
                        pilotage and the costs of keeping the vessel while in port, probable cause
                        of capture being certified by the judge, and costs and damages refused to
                        the claimants.</p>
                    <p>From this judgment no appeal was taken by either party; The evidence before
                        the prize court was not produced before the commission.</p>
                    <p>Under the order of the commission, requiring reasons for failure to appeal to
                        be filed, the claimants filed an affidavit of Mr. Outerbridge, agent for the
                        claimants Harvey &amp; Co., in which he assigned as the reason for
                        non-appeal that the master had no funds or credit at Key West to employ
                        counsel to take an appeal from said decree, or to furnish bonds on appeal;
                        that the master “believed that the release of the vessel and cargo imposed
                        on him the duty of continuing his voyage; “and that he forthwith departed
                        from Key West; and that “the claimants believed that the payment of the
                        costs imposed, as well as the declaration of probable cause of capture,
                        forming part of said decree, were within the ordinary discretion of the
                        court or its officers and formed no ground of special exception.”</p>
                    <p>No distinct or separate ruling was made by the commission as to the
                        sufficiency of these reasons for non-appeal, the question having been
                        submitted on the final hearing of the case on its merits, and in connection
                        with the other questions involved in the case. Judge Marvin, on the hearing,
                        after examining the testimony and comparing the logbook, came to the
                        conclusion that, “strange as it might seem,” the case was one of honest
                        mistake of reckoning by the master, and that he, in fact, thought he was on
                        the eastern side of Florida, and had mistaken the coast of Florida, which
                        lay to the east of him, for a part of the Bahamas, some five degrees of
                        longitude farther to the east; that in fact the vessel was innocent of any
                        intent to break the blockade; but that the circumstances under which the
                        vessel was found fully justified the capturing officer in making the
                        capture, and warianted his belief that the vessel was actually engaged in an
                        attempt to break the blockade.</p>

                                before the prize court, those proofs must be taken by the commission

                            <item>That on the evidence offered by the claimants themselves here, and
                                on their letters to the British minister, and the protest of the
                                master and officers of the schooner, the facts appearing fully
                                sustained the conclusions arrived at by Judge Marvin. That under the
                                circumstances <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0153"/>appearing to
                                the capturing officer, he was justified in making the capture and
                                taking the vessel in for condemnation. That the capturing officer in
                                such case did not stand in the place of a judicial officer,
                                compelled to decide at his own peril upon the ultimate liability of
                                a vessel to condemnation as prize, but was only bound to act
                                honestly and fairly and upon the circumstances reasonably apparent
                                to himself. That the fact that the vessel captured was involved in
                                suspicious circumstances, without fault on the part of her officers,
                                but by an honest mistake, did not change the question as to the
                                liability of the captor to damages for wrongful seizure.</item>

                            <item>That the excuse offered for failure to appeal from the judgment of
                                the prize court was insufficient. That the master had power to bind
                                his principals (the owners) for payment of counsel-fees and for the
                                security of the sureties on the appeal bond. That the statute
                                regulating practice in the prize courts then in force (12 Stat, at
                                Large, 760, sec. 7) gave full authority to the judge to extend the
                                time for taking appeal; and that the claimants having made no
                                application for such extension certainly could not allege that it
                                would not have been granted on proper application. And that the
                                second reason assigned for non-appeal amounted simply to an averment
                                that the master, as representing the claimants, and the claimants
                                themselves, on being advised by the master of the facts, did not
                                consider that there was any just ground of appeal from the decree of

                    <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that the case showed the vessel
                        out of her proper course solely from the ignorance and bewilderment of her
                        master, in consequence of thick weather and of the; vessel having drifted by
                        strong currents, unknown to the master, who was innocent of intent to break
                        the blockade; that these facts were established by her log and papers, and
                        would have satisfactorily appeared to the captors by a proper inspection of
                        the same; that the captors, having neglected to avail themselves of the
                        knowledge thus open to them from the books and papers of the vessel, were in
                        fault, and should have been cast in damages and costs; that no appeal could,
                        by law, be taken from the district court to the Supreme Court, the amount
                        involved being less than $2,000, and that, if an appeal could have been
                        taken by law, the affidavit of Mr. Outerbridge sufficiently excused the
                        failure to take it.</p>

                    <p>The memorial in this case was filed in the name of Charles Coleman, as
                        surviving partner of the firm of Charles Coleman &amp; Co., British
                        merchants, domiciled in Rio de Janeiro from 1861 to 1865, for a quantity of
                        coffee, part of the cargo of the bark Sally Magee, belonging to Richmond,
                        Va., and owned by citizens of the Confederate States there resident. Coleman
                        had in fact died about a week before the filing of the memorial, that fact
                        being unknown to the attorneys who filed the memorial in his name, but for
                        the benefit of the firm of Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., as hereinafter set
                        forth. A question was raised as to the case being regularly before the
                        commission on account of the death of the claimant before the filing of the
                        memorial, but the commission, in October, 1.872, ordered that the
                        administrator of Coleman have leave to prosecute the claim. The case was as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., a firm doing business at Richmond, Va.? and
                        composed of citizens of that city, in 1861, before the establishment of the
                        blockade, shipped goods to the claimant’s firm at Rio de Janeiro, with
                        written instructions as to the investment of the proceeds in coffee. These
                        written instructions were not produced; but the claimants gave evidence that
                        the instructions were in effect to purchase coffee if procurable, at not
                        over 10½ cents per pound, and ship it to the Richmond firm Coleman &amp; Co.
                        purchased the coffee at a price not accurately shown, but said to exceed the
                        limit given them by the Richmond firm by from one-half a cent to a cent per
                        pound, and snipped it by the Sally Magee, consigned to Edmond, Davenport
                        &amp; Co., at Richmond. The vessel sailed from Rio de Janeiro for Richmond
                        on the 12th May, 1861, and, as the claimant alleged, before intelligence of
                        the war or the blockade had reached Rio de Janeiro. She was captured by a
                        United States cruiser off the entrance of Chesapeake Bay on the 26th June,
                        1861, taken to New York, and there libelled in the United States district
                        court, and the vessel and cargo, including the coffee in question, condemned
                        as enemy’s property. (See report of the case in the district court,
                        Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 382.) In the prize court Messrs. Charles M. Fry
                        &amp; Co. intervened on behalf of Coleman &amp; Co., in respect of the
                        coffee in question, claiming it as the property of <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99"
                            facs="0155"/>Coleman &amp; Co. No express repudiation of the purchase by
                        the Richmond firm was shown; nor did it appear that the Richmond firm was
                        advised of the terms of the purchase until after the capture of the vessel.
                        Two members of that firm were examined as witnesses before the commission,
                        one of whom testified that, in view of all the circumstances, he thought his
                        firm would have ratified the purchase if the vessel had arrived safely at
                        her point of destination, while the other testified that he thought they
                        would not have ratified it. Coleman &amp; Co. appealed from the decree of
                        condemnation of the district court to the Supreme Court of the United
                        States, where the decree of the district court was affirmed, (3 Wall., 451.)
                        The condemnation in the district court and the affirmation of the same in
                        the Supreme Court both proceeded upon the ground that the coffee was, by the
                        terms of the consignment, <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> the property of
                        the consignees, and that no sufficient proof had been made of the terms of
                        the instructions given by the Richmond firm to Coleman &amp; Co. in regard
                        to the purchase, or of the violation of those instructions by Coleman &amp;
                        Co. The claim was prosecuted before the commission by Messrs. Edmond,
                        Davenport &amp; Co., at their own cost and for their own benefit, though in
                        the name of Charles Coleman, surviving partner, under an assignment
                        conveying to the former firm all the right, title, and interest of Coleman
                        &amp; Co. in the claim.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States, it was contended that the condemnation by
                        the prize court was lawful, and was sustained by the evidence before that
                        court; that no sufficient proof was there made to rebut the presumption
                        arising upon the face of the papers, that the coffee was the property of the
                        Richmond consignees; that if the facts were as alleged, Coleman &amp; Co.
                        were bound to make lawful proof of those facts before the prize court; that
                        for that purpose they should properly have applied for the taking of further
                        proofs, but that they made no such application. That having failed to make
                        such proofs before the prize court, they could not now be allowed to make
                        them <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> before the commission thus establishing
                        a state of facts different from that appearing before the prize courts. That
                        even if such new proof before the commission were admissible, the claimant,
                        by omitting to produce or account for the written instructions to Coleman
                        &amp; Co., had failed to establish even here any facts showing Coleman &amp;
                        Co. the owners of the coffee. That the parol evidence as to the terms of
                        those instructions given on the part of the claimant was inadmissible, and
                        that the claim being now prosecuted for the sole benefit of Messrs. Edmond,
                        Davenport &amp; Co., who were not British subjects, but at the time of the
                        seizure enemies of the United States, and now citizens of the same, the
                        court had no jurisdiction of the claim under the terms of the treaty. That
                        the property having been captured and condemned, as the property of Edmond,
                        Davenport &amp; Co., enemies of the United States; having been bought with
                        their money for their benefit; shipped to them in good faith; captured under
                        circumstances which made the capture lawful if <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100"
                            facs="0156"/>the property was theirs: they having attempted to avail
                        themselves of a technical right to repudiate the ownership of the property,
                        and then having taken an assignment of the claim for the purpose of
                        reimbursing themselves for the moneys invested on their behalf in the same
                        property, and now prosecuting the claim in the name of a British subject
                        wholly without actual interest in the property, the case was in substance
                        one between the United States and its own now citizens and former enemies,
                        and not covered by the spirit or equity of the treaty, and was not such a
                            <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> controversy between a subject of Great
                        Britain and the government of the United States as the treaty
                        contemplated.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the production of the
                        written instructions to Coleman &amp; Co. was sufficiently excused, and
                        parol evidence of their contents was therefore properly admitted. That such
                        proof might properly be made before the commission, though not made in the
                        prize court. That Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co. as assignees of Coleman,
                        though citizens of the United States, were entitled to a standing before the
                        commission, and <hi rend="italic">quoad</hi> this claim were to be deemed
                        British subjects, and that the claim might properly be prosecuted here by
                        Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co. as assignees of Coleman.</p>

                        insurers and underwriters.</p>
                    <p>This case and the three following cases, of the Dashing Wave, the Volant, and
                        the Science, were intimately connected in character and circumstances, and
                        were argued and submitted together. The Sir William Peel was captured by a
                        United States war-vessel on the 11th September, 1863, while lying at anchor
                        at the mouth of the Bio Grande, the stream dividing the territories of the
                        United States from those of Mexico, and upon which, about forty miles from
                        its mouth, lay on the right bank the Mexican port of Matamoras, and on the
                        left bank the United States port of Brownsville, then in possession of the
                        confederate forces. The place at which she lay was held by the United States
                        prize courts to be within Mexican and neutral waters. She was taken by the
                        captors into the port of New Orleans, there libelled in the district court
                        of the United States, and on the 6th June, 1864, a decree of restitution was
                        rendered in that court, certifying reasonable cause of seizure, and
                        providing that the question as to costs and expenses be reserved for further
                        action.” Prom this decree the United States appealed to the Supreme Court.
                        Subsequently, on the hearing in the district court <pb n="101"
                            xml:id="pg_101" facs="0157"/>of the question thus reserved, the
                        following decree was made on the 3d June 1865.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>On the preliminary trial of this cause, considering that the position of
                            the Sir William Peel, when captured, was a matter of doubt, and with a
                            view to set this question at rest, the court allowed the captors further
                            proof, and extended to the claimants the same privilege if they chose to
                            accept it.</p>
                        <p>The result of the whole testimony satisfied the mind of the court that
                            the Sir William Peel was captured when anchored south of the line
                            dividing the waters of the Rio Grande, and when, therefore, she was in
                            neutral waters. On that ground the court decreed her restitution; but
                            entertaining grave doubts as to the object of her voyage, so grave,
                            indeed, that but for this consideration, that she was captured in
                            neutral waters, the court should have decreed her condemnation, it is
                            now ordered and decreed that the costs and charges consequent upon the
                            capture be paid by the claimants, and that damages be refused.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>From this decree the claimants appealed to the Supreme Court of the United
                        States. Both appeals were heard together in the Supreme Court, and that
                        court affirmed the judgment of restitution, including its cerficate of
                        reasonable cause of seizure, rendered June 6, 1864, and reversed the decree
                        of 3d June, 1865, charging the claimants with costs, and remanded the case
                        to the district court, with directions that no costs or expenses be allowed
                        to either party as against the other. The case in the Supreme Court is
                        reported in 5 Wallace, pages 517 to 536. The opinion of that Court delivered
                        by Chief Justice Chase is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                or the testimony of persons found on board.</p>
                            <p>If upon this evidence the case is not sufficiently clear to warrant
                                condemnation or restitution, opportunity is given by the court,
                                either of its own accord or upon motion and proper grounds shown, to
                                introduce additional evidence under an order for further proof.</p>
                            <p>In the case now before us some testimony was taken, preparatory to
                                the first hearing, of persons not found on board the ship, nor,
                                indeed, in any way connected with her.</p>
                            <p>This evidence was properly excluded by the district judge, and the
                                hearing took place on the proper proofs.</p>
                            <p>Upon that hearing an order for further proof was made, allowing the
                                libellants and captors on the one side, and the claimants on the
                                other, to put in additional evidence; and such evidence was put in
                                accordingly on both sides.</p>
                            <p>The preparatory evidence on the first hearing consisted of the
                                depositions of the master of the ship, the mate, and one seaman. No
                                papers were produced, for none were found on board; a circumstance
                                explained by the statement of the master, that all the papers
                                belonging to the vessel, except the lighter-men’s receipts for the
                                cargo, were with the English consul and the consignees of the ship
                                at Matamoras.</p>
                            <p>The depositions established the neutral ownership of the ship and
                                cargo. They proved that the Sir William Peel was a British
                                merchantman; that she had brought a general cargo, no part of which
                                was contraband, from Liverpool to Matamoras; that this cargo, except
                                an inconsiderable portion, had been delivered to the consignee at
                                the latter port; that the cotton found on board was part of her
                                return cargo; that it was owned by neutrals, and had a neutral
                                destination; and that the ship, when captured, was in Mexican
                                waters, well south of the boundary between Mexico and Texas.</p>
                            <p>This proof clearly required restitution. The order for further proof
                                was probably made upon the rejected depositions, which, though
                                inadmissible as evidence for condemnation, may have been allowed to
                                be used as affidavits on the motion for the order.</p>
                            <p>The further proof, when taken, was conflicting.</p>
                            <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0158"/>
                            <p>The weight of evidence, we think, put the vessel, at the time of
                                capture, in Mexican waters; hut if the ship or cargo was enemy
                                property, or either was otherwise liable, to condemnation, that
                                circumstance by itself would not avail the claim<gap quantity="1"
                                    unit="characters"/>ts in a prize court. It might constitute a
                                ground of claim by the neutral power, those territory had suffered
                                trespass, for apology or indemnity. But neither an enemy, nor a
                                neutral acting the part of an enemy, can demand restitution of
                                captured property on the sole ground of capture in neutral
                                waters.</p>
                            <p>We must therefore look further into the case.</p>
                            <p>There is some evidence which justifies suspicion. Several witnesses
                                state facts which tend to prove that the Peel was in the employment
                                of the rebel government, and that part, at least, of the cotton
                                laden upon her as return cargo was in fact rebel property.</p>
                            <p>There are statements, on the other hand, which make it probable that
                                the Peel was in truth what she professed to be, a merchant-steamer,
                                belonging to neutral merchants, and nothing more; that her cargo was
                                consigned in good faith by neutral owners for sale at Matamoras, or
                                to be conveyed across the river and sold in Texas, as it might
                                lawfully be, not being contraband; that the cotton was purchased by
                                neutrals and on neutral account, with the proceeds of the cargo or
                                other money.</p>
                            <p>In this conflict of evidence we do not think ourselves warranted in
                                condemning, or in quite excusing, the vessel or her cargo. We shall,
                                therefore, affirm the decree by the district court, and direct
                                restitution, without costs or expenses to either party as against
                                the other.</p>

                    <p>This opinion sufficiently states the facts of the case as appearing by the
                        evidence in the prize court, and those facts were not substantially changed
                        by any evidence taken before the commission.</p>
                    <p>The claim before the commission was prosecuted by Edwin Gerard as assignee of
                        the owners of the vessel and cargo, and as attorney-in-fact for the insurers
                        and underwriters, some one hundred and fifty in number. The vessel and cargo
                        were fully insured against capture as well as other losses; and upon the
                        capture the owners abandoned vessel and cargo to the underwriters, who
                        accepted the abandonment and paid as for a total loss. Pending the case in
                        the district court, forty bales of cotton, part of the cargo, were sold by
                        order of the court, and the proceeds paid into the registry of the court.
                        And, pending the case on appeal in the Supreme Court, the vessel, her
                        tackle, stores, &amp;c, and the remainder of her cargo, having been
                        appraised at the sum of $857,642, United States currency, were, by order of
                        the court, delivered to the claimants on their furnishing stipulations in
                        the said appraised value with security. The claimants claimed the sum of
                        £35,314.16.9, the sum of the amounts paid by the insurers to the assured
                        less the net salvage obtained by the sale of the vessel and cargo, and the
                        further sum of $369,000, demurrage from the 11th September, 1863, to the
                        15th September, 1864, besides interest on both said sums.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the claimant filed, in No. 391, a general argument applicable
                        to the cases of the Sir William Peel, the Dashing Wave, the Volant, the
                        Science, and the Geziena Heligonda. In this argument he maintained that the
                        Rio Grande being the common boundary between Mexico at peace and Texas at
                        war with the United States, and the navigation of the river being, by the
                        law of nations as well as by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, free and
                        common to the citizens of both republics, the <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"
                            facs="0159"/>United States could not lawfully blockade that river so as
                        to interfere with the free ingress and egress of neutral vessels engaged in
                        trade with Matamoras, or with the right of such vessels to lie at anchor in
                        the roadstead at the mouth of the Rio Grande, while engaged in lawfully
                        discharging or receiving cargoes on neutral account through the custom-house
                        at Matamoras, or so as to interfere with inland trade carried on across the
                        Rio Grande, from Mexico to Texas or from Texas to Mexico. That the British
                        trade with Matamoras was a legitimate trade according to established
                        principles of public law. That these doctrines were fully recognized by the
                        Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the Peter, hoff, (5
                        Wallace, p. 28;) and by the courts of the United States in other cases,
                        notably that of the Labuan in the district court of the southern district of
                        New York. That it had also been fully recognized by the Secretary of State
                        of the United States, in the diplomatic correspondence with the British
                        legation, concerning the cases of the Labuan, the Magicienne, the Peterhoff,
                        the Sir William Peel, and other cases; and by the legislative authorities of
                        the same in appropriations for payment of the awards in the cases of the
                        Labuan, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>That, notwithstanding the recognition by the courts and executive and
                        legislative authorities of the United States of these principles, in
                        practice they had been disregarded, and British merchant-vessels, whether
                        found on the high seas and destined to the mouth of the Rio Grande, with
                        cargoes consigned to Matamoras, or anchored off the mouth of the river and
                        engaged in good faith in the discharge of neutral cargoes for Matamoras, and
                        in taking on board cargoes purchased at that port on neutral account, had
                        been subjected to capture and adjudication as maritime prize.</p>
                    <p>That these captures had been the subject of earnest but temperate
                        remonstrance on the part of Her Majesty’s government, and were regarded as
                        violations of the just maritime rights of Great Britain, and as assumptions
                        of belligerent power not warranted by the law of nations.</p>
                    <p>That the claims arising out of these captures were among the most important
                        in the contemplation of Her Majesty’s government in the establishment of the
                        Joint High Commission, and by that commission, in the provisions of articles
                        12 to 17 of the treaty providing for the establishment and conduct of this
                        commission. That this commission had full jurisdiction of the claims in
                        question, and to review and overrule the final judgments of the prize courts
                        of last resort of the United States.</p>
                    <p>That by the terms of the treaty, and of the “solemn declaration" subscribed
                        by the commissioners pursuant to the provisions of the treaty, they were to
                        decide each and all of the claims “according to justice and equity.” That
                        this provision gave to the present commission a broader and more
                        comprehensive power than was given by the 7th article of the treaty of 1794
                        between the United States and Great Britain (8 Stat, at L., 121) to the
                        commission provided for by that article, which was required to decide the
                        claims referred to it according to “justice, equity, and the laws of
                        nations.” That the omission of the last-named element <pb n="104"
                            xml:id="pg_104" facs="0160"/>of the prescribed rule of conduct from the
                        present treaty was significant. That under the present treaty the judgments
                        of the American prize tribunals were to be tested in each case by this
                        commission according to the principles of “justice and equity” only. That
                        “whether the law of nations justifies those decisions or not, unless they
                        are <hi rend="italic">also</hi> justified in the conscientious judgment of
                        the commissioners by justice and equity, the compensation which they fail to
                        give must be awarded to the parties.” That “the inquiry is not limited to
                        the question whether the law of nations entitled the claimants to
                        compensation, but extends beyond that narrow range, and its broad scope is
                        whether the parties are equitably entitled, under all the circumstances
                        surrounding the cases, to receive indemnification for their losses.” That it
                        was the intention of the framers of the treaty to confer upon this
                        commission “a more extensive jurisdiction, and greater power to do justice
                        than was exercisable by the prize courts of the United States deciding
                        according to the law of nations.” That the technical rule of the prize
                        courts, that “probable cause “not merely excuses, but in some cases
                        justifies, a capture, is a hard rule, “admitted to be opposed to the
                        fundamental ideas of justice and equity,” and “only to be justified upon
                        grounds which justify the extreme severity of the other operations of war.”
                        That therefore this commission was not bound to refuse damages in cases of
                        restitution to the claimants, even “if they should think that the appellate
                        prize court was warranted in its decision that there existed, in the sense
                        of the prize law, probable cause of capture.”</p>
                    <p>That if, however, it should be held that the only inquiry to be instituted by
                        the commission in such cases is, “whether there were such reasonable-grounds
                        of suspicion as constitute what is technically called probable cause of
                        capture,” the commissioners should nevertheless adjudicate according to
                        their own judgment of the facts and the law constituting the foundation of
                        probable cause, “unembarrassed by the special and technical rules of the
                        prize code.” That though the commission is not therefore bound by the
                        principles held by the prize courts in their adjudications, but has a larger
                        and more equitable jurisdiction, yet the decisions of prize courts of the
                        highest authority have established the duty of condemning captors in costs
                        and damages where they have unjustly interfered with the operation of lawful
                        neutral commerce. In this connection the counsel cited the cases of the
                        Elizabeth, 1 Acton, 10; the Ostsee, 9 Moore’s P. C. R., 150; the Gerasimo,
                        11 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 88; the Newport, <hi rend="italic">id</hi>,
                        187.</p>
                    <p>In answer to these propositions in the general argument the counsel for the
                        United States fully admitted the propositions as held and recognized by the
                        judicial, executive, and legislative authorities of the United States, that
                        the <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> trade with Matamoras was a legitimate
                        trade; that the United States could not lawfully blockade the mouth of the
                        Bio Grande or the port of Matamoras, or any other Mexican port, nor
                        interfere with the legitimate ingress or egress of neutral vessels engaged
                        in trade with Matamoras, or with the right of such vessels to lie <pb
                            n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0161"/>at anchor in the roadstead at the
                        month of the Rio Grande while engaged in the <hi rend="italic">bona

                    <p>He denied that in practice the United States had violated these principles or
                        undertaken to assert rights inconsistent with them, but maintained that, on
                        the contrary, the State Department of the United States, in its diplomatic
                        correspondence, had recognized their validity; insisting only that the
                        question of the application of these principles to the facts of each
                        particular case was to be determined by the regular prize tribunals, which
                        might be safely trusted to do entire justice in every case.</p>
                    <p>That the decisions of those courts in the various cases referred to by the
                        counsel for the claimant, fully recognized those principles and applied them
                        to the facts appearing in each case; and that in the disposition not only of
                        those cases, but generally of all the prize cases arising during the war,
                        those courts had carefully adhered to the principles of international law as
                        recognized in the prize courts of all civilized countries, and had extended
                        to neutral vessels and cargoes a degree of projection, to say the least,
                        quite as ample and complete as that afforded by the prize courts of Great
                        Britain, under the learned and widely known and recognized decisions of Sir
                        William Scott and his successors in those courts.</p>
                    <p>He admitted fully the jurisdiction of the commission, and their power and
                        duty under the treaty to review the final judgments of the prize courts of
                        ultimate resort of the respective nations, as not conclusive upon the
                        respective governments, which might intervene on behalf of their subjects
                        against the judgments of those courts, such jurisdiction having been long
                        since fully established by the direct decision of the commission upon that
                        question, and not having since been disputed.</p>
                    <p>As to the rules and principles by which the commission were to be governed in
                        their decisions upon these cases, he maintained that the rule prescribed by
                        the treaty, that the commissioners should “impartially and carefully examine
                        and decide to the best of their judgment, and according to justice and
                        equity,” had in no respect abolished or changed those well-settled
                        principles, in accordance with which the tribunals of the civilized world
                        have been accustomed to decide upon the validity of captures and the
                        respective rights of belligerents and neutrals in relation to them. That
                        “justice and equity” were not to be attained by a disregard of judicial
                        precedents and established principles of judicial proceeding.</p>
                    <p>That to adopt the doctrine propounded by the counsel for the claimant was to
                        substitute the mere fancy or caprice of a tribunal acting without guidance
                        or authority, for those sound rules established and followed by judicial
                        tribunals, in the light of the learning and experience of ages, for the very
                        furtherance of “justice and equity.” That true “justice and equity” are
                        recognized by all judicial tribunals, municipal or international, as
                        attainable only by well-defined and settled rules and principles <pb n="106"
                            xml:id="pg_106" facs="0162"/>of general application. That if this idea
                        is lost sight of, substantial justice as well as substantial equity is at an
                        end; and the rights of parties are committed to the absolute and
                        uncontrolled will and caprice of the judicial officer, instead of the
                        protection of the law.</p>
                    <p>That while, therefore, the right of the commission to sit in judgment upon
                        the validity and correctness of the judgments of the prize courts of the
                        United States upon these cases is not now questioned; such validity and
                        correctness are to be determined only in accordance with the settled
                        principles of prize law, as recognized by the two countries.</p>
                    <p>That in reviewing the judgments of the highest appellate courts of either of
                        the two countries, high contracting parties to the treaty, the high
                        reputation of those courts respectively, the weight uniformly given to the
                        decisions of each by the other, and the rules of international comity and
                        mutual respect, dictate that such judgments are not to be rashly or hastily
                        overruled or reversed; but only on a clear showing of a violation of the
                        rules of international law <hi rend="italic">in re minime dubia</hi>. That
                        the question to be decided in these cases is whether injustice has been done
                        to the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty by the judicial tribunals of the
                        United States; and that the commission certainly cannot find that such
                        injustice has been done, unless they find that the well-settled principles
                        of international law have been violated by those tribunals.</p>
                    <p>In answer to the proposition of the claimant’s counsel, that the rule of the
                        prize courts disallowing damages to the claimant where “probable cause"
                        appears for the capture, is one of extreme severity as against the neutral
                        trader, “opposed to the fundamental ideas of justice and equity,” and “a
                        hard rule, admitted to be such by all writers on the law of nations,” the
                        counsel for the United States cited the language of Dr. Lushington, in the
                        case of the Leucade, (2 Spinks, 236,) as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Lord Stowell administered the prize law on great and comprehensive
                                principles. His object was that, on the whole, equal justice should
                                be done to the rights of the belligerent and the just claims of
                                neutral nations; but he did not seek in each particular case to do
                                the most perfect justice. Many passages in his judgments might be
                                cited to show this; whereby he declared that, though there might be
                                hardships in particular cases, both to captors and especially
                                neutrals, yet, on the whole, the balance was in favor of the neutral
                                rather than against him. Lord Stowell used so say, though blockade
                                was a hardship on a neutral, and the right of search was a hardship
                                on a neutral, yet it was to be recollected the whole trade was
                                always open to them—the carrying trade in time of war. He used
                                always to say, and rely greatly on that rule of law, that, in the
                                first instance, the case should be heard on the evidence of the
                                claimants themselves, namely, the ship’s papers and depositions.</p>
                            <p>In the case of the Diligentia, (1 Dods., 404,) where the captors
                                complained of what Lord Stowell was about to do, Lord Stowell made
                                the same answer; he told them, though they might complain in
                                particular instances, yet he must adhere to the general principle,
                                though the consequences might press hard upon them. Now, no person
                                more readily acknowledged the truth of the principle, that a
                                claimant should be indemnified for a capture made without probable
                                cause, than Lord Stowell; no one more powerfully manifested it; but
                                that will necessarily presuppose that the court is in possession of
                                the truth.</p>
                            <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0163"/>
                            <p>It is equally contrary to common justice that a captor should be
                                mulcted in costs and damages where he has faithfully performed his
                                duty, and had, in truth, adequate cause for the seizure. Yet this
                                cause of seizure might not appear on the face of the depositions and
                                ship’s papers. So it might be in blockade cases, and in numerous
                                others which might be stated.</p>

                                commission was as to the right of the owners to damages; that the
                                claimants were in no position to make such claim before the
                                commission; that any right to damages in the prize courts was barred
                                by the first decree of the district court of 6th June, 1864, which
                                adjudged reasonable cause of seizure, and that from this decree or
                                from any part of it the claimants had never appealed; that the
                                question as to costs and expenses” reserved by that decree was
                                plainly the question only whether costs and expenses should be
                                allowed against the claimants, their right to claim costs and
                                expenses against the captors being barred by the certificate of
                                “reasonable cause of seizure” contained in the same decree; that the
                                claimants, having failed to appeal from so much of this decree as
                                certified reasonable cause of seizure, must be considered, in the
                                language of the letter of Sir William Scott and Dr. Nicholl to Mr
                                Jay, (3 Phillimore, 554,) to have “acknowledged the justice of the
                                sentence in that respect,” and that within the rule of practice
                                already settled by the commission the claimants, having neither
                                appealed nor rendered any reason for not having appealed, their
                                claim must be disallowed; that the only effect of the second decree
                                of the district court of 3d June, 1865, from which the claimants did
                                appeal, was to charge the claimants with the costs and charges of
                                the captors, and that on their appeal from this decree they had had
                                full relief by the judgment of the Supreme Court; that it had never
                                been possible for the Supreme Court to award damages in favor of the
                                claimant had they been so disposed, such damages being barred by the
                                certificate of probable cause in the first decree of 6th June, 1864,
                                from which the claimants had not appealed; that the claimants had

                                on the purely artificial and technical rule that such evidence must
                                come in the first instance from the vessel herself and those on
                                board of her, were here competent evidence under the terms of the

                                to such artificial rule of exclusion; and that those depositions not
                                only greatly strengthened the case made before the prize court as
                                one of probable cause, but in connection with the other proofs would

                            <item><p>That the fact that the vessel was taken in neutral waters, in
                                    no respect changed the case as to the respective rights of
                                    captors and claimants. That in such case it was only the neutral
                                    power whose waters had been violated that had cause of
                                    complaint; and such power only could be hard to raise the
                                    question of violation of her waters. That if the United States
                                    by this capture had violated any rights of Mexico, that was a

                                    That so far as the questions between these claimants and the

                                for the purpose of its prosecution against the United States. That
                                by the law of England, the purchase of a chose in action by an
                                attorney for the purpose of prosecution was illegal; that the same
                                rule prevailed in most, if not all, of the United States; and that
                                in practice it ought to prevail in international law. That such
                                champertous purchases of claims, void by the common law of both
                                countries, should not be recognized as lawful transactions, or be
                                permitted as the basis of claims to be prosecuted by one of those
                                governments against the other.</item>

                            <item>That the contracts of insurance by these insurers with the assured
                                were deliberate contracts to indemnify British subjects for the
                                consequences of attempted violation of the belligerent rights of the
                                United States; that such contracts, when sought to be enforced in
                                the courts of the United States, would be held void by those courts;
                                that like contracts, in relation to attempted violation of the
                                belligerent rights of Great Britain, if prosecuted in the courts of
                                that kingdom, would be held void by her courts; that, therefore, in
                                an international tribunal constituted by solemn treaty between the
                                two governments, the comity of nations and a proper regard by one
                                friendly government of the rights of another should preclude the
                                admissibility of such claims. That <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109"
                                    facs="0165"/>these contracts of insurance were distinguishable
                                from “war risks” recognized by all nations as legitimate subjects of
                                insurance, and such as were discussed among the American claims
                                before the tribunal at Geneva; those were assurances of the
                                merchant-vessels of a belligerent against capture by their enemy,
                                and such as are recognized in all wars of maritime nations as a
                                permissible and necessary means to the preservation of any commerce
                                whatever to a belligerent; but these are del itinerate contracts to
                                indemnify a neutral who, by carefully excluding the “free from
                                capture” clause, admits that he is engaged in an attempt to violate
                                the belligerent rights of a friendly nation. That though the
                                violation of blockade by a neutral is not held by international law
                                to be strictly a crime, it is an unfriendly act, prejudicial to the
                                character and interests of the neutral government of which the
                                violator is a citizen, and to her honest and legitimate traders, and
                                calculated to promote discord and hostility between friendly
                                nations. That a contract to indemnify the citizen of a neutral
                                government against the lawful consequences of his own wrongful act
                                against a friendly government, should never be made a ground of
                                reclamation by the government of the wrong-doer against the injured
                                government, nor be countenanced by an international tribunal
                                organized as a means of amicable settlement between two such
                                governments.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended in answer that the Supreme
                        Court of the United States had in effect passed upon all the questions
                        involved in the prize court, and had finally adjudged that the claimants
                        should not have damages against the captors; and had determined that the
                        fact of the capture having taken place in the waters of Mexico, a neutral
                        and friendly nation, did not make the capture a wrongful one as between the
                        captors and the claimants, Mexico not having intervened. That on the proofs
                        in the case there were no such circumstances of suspicion as to afford
                        probable cause of capture within the doctrines of the prize courts. That if
                        such probable cause within the rules of those courts existed, it was plain,
                        from the proofs before the commission, that actual injustice had been done
                        to the owners of the vessel and cargo; that the vessel was engaged in a
                        legitimate commerce; and that, according to justice and equity, the
                        claimants should be reimbursed for the losses in consequence of the capture
                        ultimately adjudged a wrongful one, even though the capture were held
                        excused by the doctrine of probable cause under prize law. That the capture
                        of the vessel within the neutral waters of Mexico was in violation of
                        international law, and absolutely illegal and void. That the doctrines of
                        the prize courts that such a capture could only be questioned by the
                        government whose territory had been violated, applied only to the case of an
                        enemy ship captured in neutral waters and not to the case of a neutral
                        vessel so captured. That, even if that doctrine applied in the last-named
                        case, it was only as a technical rule of the prize courts requiring an
                        intervention there by the government whose territory had been violated, and
                            <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0166"/>was not applicable in the case
                        of an international tribunal, which should be controlled by the
                        consideration that the capture was an illegal one under international
                        law.</p>

                    <p>The counsel for the claimant also maintained that the insurers and
                        underwriters were to be deemed parties to the memorial by Mr. Gerard, as
                        their attorney in fact; that the assignment to Gerard was a valid one; and
                        that the contracts of insurance were also valid and entitled to recognition
                        and protection under international law.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) gave the claimants an
                        award for $272,920. I am advised that the award was placed by the majority
                        of the commission on the ground that the capture within the neutral waters
                        of Mexico was absolutely illegal and void; and that the claimants were
                        entitled to make reclamation on that ground, irrespective of any question of
                        complaint or intervention on the part of Mexico.</p>

                        cargo.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured while at anchor off the mouth of the Rio Grande, on
                        the 5th November, 1863; was taken into the port of New Orleans and there
                        libelled in the United States district court. A decree was made in that
                        court, 16th June, 1864, adjudging restitution of the vessel to the
                        claimants; from which decree the United States appealed to the Supreme
                        Court. Further proceedings were had in the district court on the question of
                        costs and damages; and, on the 3d June, 1865, a decree was made adjudging
                        that the costs and charges consequent upon the capture be paid by the
                        claimants, and that damages be refused to them.</p>
                    <p>From this decree the claimants appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme
                        Court affirmed the decree of the district court restoring the vessel and
                        cargo; but directed that the costs and expenses consequent upon the capture
                        be rateably apportioned between the vessel and the shipment of coin
                        hereinafter named; and that the residue of the cargo be exempted from
                        contribution. The district court determined, upon the <pb n="111"
                            xml:id="pg_111" facs="0167"/>proofs, that the vessel when captured was
                        anchored south of the line dividing the waters of the Rio Grande, and was
                        therefore in neutral waters.</p>
                    <p>The Supreme Court held, on the contrary, that the proofs clearly showed her
                        to have been anchored north of the division line above named and within the
                        waters of Texas, then in possession of the enemies of the United States. The
                        case in the Supreme Court is reported in 5th Wallace, pages 170 to 178; to
                        which report reference is made for the statement of the peculiar facts of
                        the case. No proofs were made before the commission substantially changing
                        the facts as there stated.</p>
                    <p>Many of the questions involved in this case were identical with those
                        involved in the case of the Sir William Peel above reported, and therefore
                        need not be again stated.</p>
                    <p>Edwin Gerard, No. 244, claimed as assignee of the insurers of Messrs. F.
                        DeLizardi &amp; Co., the alleged owners of 12,000 British sovereigns, a
                        portion of the cargo upon which, together with the vessel, the costs and
                        expenses consequent upon the capture were apportioned by the decree of the
                        Supreme Court.</p>
                    <p>Simpson &amp; Pitman, No. 398, and McDowell &amp; Halliday, No. 397,
                        claimants as owners respectively of parts of the cargo exempted from
                        contribution by the final decree, claimed damages by the depreciation of the
                        cargo during its detention, and for costs and expenses to which they had
                        been subjected.</p>
                    <p>The insurance companies, Nos. 427 and 428, claimed respectively as insurers
                        of portions of the cargo in like manner exempted from contribution and which
                        had been duly abandoned to them as insurers, and payments made by them
                        respectively as upon a total loss.</p>
                    <p>Upon the two last-named claims of the insurance companies, questions were
                        raised on the part of the United States, as to the validity of the contract
                        of insurance in the same regard reported above in the case of the Sir
                        William Peel, and also as to the right of the insurance companies to recover
                        in respect of portions of the cargo owned by persons not appearing to have
                        been British subjects. This last-named question was subsequently more
                        distinctly raised and passed upon in the case of the Circassian, and will be
                        hereafter reported under that case.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                    <p>The Brig Volant, John Amy <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, No. 388, claimants
                        for vessel; Edwin Gerard, No. 245, claimant for cargo.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured on the 5th November, 1863, at the mouth of the Rio
                        Grande, taken into the port of New Orleans, and there libelled. By a decree
                        rendered on the 11th June, 1864, the district court condemned the vessel and
                        cargo as lawful prize. From this decree the claimants appealed to the
                        Supreme Court, which court reversed the decree of condemnation, but held
                        that the capture was justified by “probable cause,” and adjudged restitution
                        of the vessel on payment of costs and charges. The case is reported in the
                        Supreme Court in 5th Wallace, <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0168"/>pp.
                        179, 180. It appeared that the vessel, when captured, was anchored within
                        Texan waters.</p>
                    <p>The claimants in No. 388 claimed as owners of the vessel for reimbursement of
                        the costs and charges paid by them, and for damages by the detention of the
                        vessel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerard, in No. 245, claimed, as assignee of the insurers of the cargo to
                        whom the same had been abandoned, and who had paid as for a total loss,
                        about 140,000, besides interest, for depreciation of cargo after the
                        seizure, including the value of ninety-three cases of brandy, alleged to
                        have been abstracted from the vessel while in custody of the officers of the
                        district court.</p>
                    <p>The questions involved in respect to this vessel are substantially covered by
                        the report of the foregoing case of the Sir William Peel, and by the report
                        of the case in 5th Wallace.</p>
                    <p>The claim of Amy and others, No. 388, in respect of the vessel, was
                        unanimously disallowed by the commission.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Mr. Gerard, No. 245, the commission made an award in favor of
                        the claimant for $1,785, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting. I am advised
                        that this award was made in respect of the brandy abstracted while in charge
                        of the officers of the district court; and that the other claims for damages
                        in the case were disallowed.</p>

                    <p>This vessel was captured at the same time and place with the Dashing Wave and
                        the Volant, libelled in the same court, and the same decrees entered
                        respectively as in the case of the Dashing Wave, and the same appeals taken
                        by the respective parties to the Supreme Court. That court affirmed both
                        judgments of the district court restoring the vessel, and charging her with
                        the costs and expenses of capture, finding upon the proofs that she was,
                        when captured, anchored within Texan waters, and that no excuse appeared for
                        her being there. The case in the Supreme Court is reported in 5th Wallace,
                        pp. 178, 179.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the claimants, in addition to the points above cited in the
                        case of the Sir William Peel applicable to this case, contended that the
                        capture was one made in bad faith; that the Science had arrived off the
                        mouth of the Rio Grande on the 11th August; that, immediately on her
                        arrival, she was boarded by an officer of a United States blockading vessel,
                        who examined her papers and inspected her cargo, and permitted her to anchor
                        and discharge her outward cargo, and take on board a large portion of her
                        return cargo; that the only allegation made by the capturing officer was
                        that her outward cargo had included cloth of the character and description
                        used for confederate uniforms; that this allegation constituted no ground of
                        capture, and even if originally it might have afforded probable cause of
                        capture, it certainly could not, after the vessel had been allowed to lie
                        three months in the offing, and take on board a valuable cargo of over <pb
                            n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0169"/>300 bales of cot ion. That the fact
                        of her being at anchor within Texan waters, if it existed, did not of itself
                        constitute probable cause, there being no evidence in the case to indicate
                        an intention of violation of the blockade; that, by international law and
                        under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the roadstead at the mouth of the Rio
                        Grande was an open roadstead, where neutral vessels trading with Matamoras
                        had a right to lie at anchor, whether north or south of the conventional
                        line between the United States and Mexico established by that treaty; and
                        that the United States could no more lawfully interfere with the enjoyment
                        of that right than they could with the right of vessels in course of the
                        same trade to navigate the mouth and current of the river; that the right to
                        the navigation of the Rio Grande included the right to the means without
                        which such navigation could not be reasonably enjoyed— among others, the
                        right to moor in the roadstead at its mouth. That, even if the United States
                        could claim an exclusive right to occupy the waters north of this line for
                        the purpose of blockade, that a vessel honestly engaged in trade with
                        Matamoras, and anchoring for that purpose on the Texan side of the line, was
                        entitled to notice or warning before it could be treated as intruding on
                        forbidden ground, and that a seizure without such notice was unjustifiable;
                        that, in fact, the proofs failed to establish that the vessel was lying
                        north of the dividing line, and that the blockading vessels, by omitting to
                        apprize her that she was anchored in a place which they deemed an improper
                        one, and by permitting her to be there and take on board her return cargo,
                        were estopped to allege that her position was an unlawful one.</p>

                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the Science, and the
                        other vessels of her class, could not enter by reason of their draught of
                        water and never attempted to enter, the mouth of the Rio Grande, or to reach
                        the port of Matamoras. That, conceding her full right to navigate that river
                        and the waters through which its mouth was to be approached, and even for
                        that purpose to pass over the blockaded waters of the Confederate States, it
                        did not follow that she had the right, for her own convenience and for the
                        delivery of her cargo into lighters, to cast anchor within those blockaded
                        waters, and there lie for weeks in a position from which access, by means of
                        lighters to the blockaded coast, was easier, by night or by day, than that
                        to the neutral port for which her cargo professed to be destined. That the
                        United States were lawfully entitled to blockade, and did blockade the
                        sea-coast of Texas, and that such blockade would be wholly nugatory if a
                        vessel in the condition of the Science could claim and exercise the right to
                        cast anchor within the blockaded waters, and within three miles of the
                        enemy’s <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0170"/>coast, from which it was
                        evident that she could, with great facility, hold communication with that
                        coast.</p>
                    <p>The commission awarded to the claimant the sum of $45,684, Mr. Commissioner

                    <p>The schooner Matamoras; Oliver K. King, administrator, claimant, No. 288.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured at the mouth of the Rio Grande at the same time with
                        the Dashing Wave, the Volant, and the Science, and libelled in the United
                        States district court at New Orleans. The district court, on the proofs,
                        decided that, at the time of the capture, she was in Mexican waters, and
                        gave judgment of restitution, certifying reasonable cause of capture, and
                        refusing allowance of costs or expenses to the claimant. No appeal was taken
                        from the judgment of the district court.</p>
                    <p>Under the order of the commission the claimant assigned as the reason of his
                        omission to appeal, that, “in consequence of the short space of time in
                        which to appeal, only thirty clays being allowed for that purpose, and the
                        detention of the mails, and the counsel in New Orleans not having taken the
                        appeal, the time to appeal expired.”</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the proofs showed
                        probable cause of capture in the conduct and position of the Matamoras; but
                        this was denied on the part of the claimants. The counsel for the United
                        States insisted that no sufficient excuse was assigned for the failure to
                        appeal.</p>
                    <p>The commission disallowed the claim, (Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting,) on
                        the ground of the insufficiency of the reasons for failure to appeal.</p>
                    <p>The Isabel; George Wigg, claimant, No. 269.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured on the 23d September, 1852, on a voyage from
                        Bayport, in Florida, to Havana; was taken into the port of Key West, there
                        libelled in the United States district court before Judge Marvin, and
                        condemned as lawful prize. An appeal was taken, under the then existing law,
                        to the circuit court of the United States for the same district; and this
                        appeal was subsequently, under the United States statutes of 3d March, 1863,
                        (12 Stats, at L., 730, § 7,) and of 30th June, 1861, (13 <hi rend="italic"
                            >id.</hi>, 311, § 13,) transferred by stipulation to the Supreme Court,
                        in which court the claimant having failed to file the transcript from the
                        court below, pursuant to the rules of that court, the case was dismissed, on
                        motion of the United States, without appearance on the part of the claimant.
                        The claimant alleged himself the sole owner of both vessel and cargo; and
                        alleged that the port of Bayport, from which the vessel sailed, was not
                        blockaded at the time of the capture or of the entrance or departure of the
                        Isabel into and from that port. The fact of no blockade was sought to be
                        established by the testimony of the master and <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115"
                            facs="0171"/>crew of the vessel, who testified that they saw no
                        blockading vessels on entering or departing. The time of day or night of
                        their entrance or departure was not shown.</p>
                    <p>The counsel of the United States relied on the official reports of the
                        Secretary of the Navy and accompanying documents for the years 1862 and
                        1883, and upon the decision of the district court having judicial knowledge
                        of the current historical facts of the day, as sufficiently establishing the
                        fact of blockade. Documentary proofs were filed on the part of the United
                        States going to show the claimant, Wigg, at the time of the capture of the
                        vessel actually engaged in shipping munitions of war to the confederate
                        government; and that both before and after the capture, he and the vessels
                        which he owned or controlled were for a long time largely engaged in the
                        like employment.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained: 1, that the Isabel was
                        lawfully captured in the actual course of a voyage in violation of the
                        blockade; 2, that, by the failure of the claimant to prosecute his appeal to
                        the Supreme Court, and procure an adjudication of that court upon the merits
                        of his case, he was debarred from a standing before the commission; 3, that,
                        by his personal acts in aid of the enemies of the United States in carrying
                        on their war against those States, the claimant was debarred of any standing
                        as a British subject before the commission; 4, that, by those acts, he had
                        constituted himself an enemy of the United States, so that his property upon
                        the high seas was liable to capture as enemy’s property, irrespective of any
                        question of blockade.</p>
                    <p>All these propositions were controverted on the part of the claimant.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The steamship Pearl; Shand, Higson &amp; Co., claimants, No. 270.</p>
                    <p>The Pearl was captured in January, 1863, by a United States cruiser, in the
                        Atlantic Ocean, between the Bahama Banks and Nassau, on a voyage purporting
                        to be from Queenstown to Nassau. She was taken into the port of Key West,
                        and there libelled as prize on the alleged ground that her actual
                        destination was for one of the blockaded ports. Mr. Geo. Wigg intervened as
                        claimant in the district court, alleging himself the sole and absolute owner
                        of the vessel. The district court adjudged restitution of the vessel and
                        cargo. An appeal was taken by the United States to the Supreme Court, and
                        that court reversed the decree of the district court, and adjudged
                        condemnation of the vessel and cargo. (See report of the case of the Pearl,
                        5th Wallace, 574.)</p>
                    <p>The claimants here alleged that the vessel, though purchased by Wigg in his
                        own name, was actually purchased by him as agent for Messrs. J. &amp; T.
                        Johnson, merchants of Liverpool, to whom she actually belonged, though
                        registered in the name of Wigg. That J. &amp; T. Johnson had, since the
                        condemnation, assigned to the claimants, by way of mortgage, their claim
                        upon the United States for the alleged wrongful capture and condemnation. No
                        proofs were made by the claimants of the <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116"
                            facs="0172"/>title of the Messrs. Johnson, nor of the assignment of the
                        claim by them to the claimants.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>The schooner D. F. Keeling: Mary Hutchinson, claimant, No. 277.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was seized in the port of New York, on the 6th October, 1861, and
                        libelled in the United States district court for confiscation under the
                        statute of 13th July, 1861, (12 Stat, at L.,) as the property of an
                        inhabitant of the State of Louisiana, then in rebellion against the United
                        States. The claimant, Mary Hutchinson, interposed a claim to the vessel,
                        denying that she was an inhabitant of New Orleans, alleging herself a
                        native-born subject of Great Britain, and only transiently present in New
                        Orleans upon a visit to relatives there residing. The district court found
                        this allegation sustained by the proofs, and adjudged restitution of the
                        vessel, certifying probable cause of seizure, and refusing costs or damages
                        to the claimant. No appeal was taken from the decree of the district court.
                        On the part of the claimant an affidavit of one Leetch was filed, excusing
                        the omission to appeal on the ground that his own business required him to
                        return home immediately to Mexico, (he having been at the time the agent of
                        Mrs. Hutchinson,) and that Mrs. Hutchinson was not able to attend to the
                        appeal in person, “by reason of age and infirmity.” The claimant’s memorial,
                        verified by her own oath, alleged that she was born in 1813, making her
                        forty-eight years old at the date of the decree of restitution. She claimed
                        here damages by the detention of the vessel, and costs incurred in defense
                        of the suit, $18,063, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>The proofs before the commission showed that the claimant emigrated with her
                        husband to New Orleans about 1850; that her husband died there in 1852, and
                        that the claimant had ever since, up to the date of the deposition,
                        (February, 1873,) been permanently domiciled in New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the proof here fully
                        showed the liability of the vessel to condemnation before the district
                        court; that such condemnation was there defeated by false allegations and
                        proofs; that, on the merits, the claimant was not entitled to damages; and
                        that no sufficient reason was shown for her failure to appeal from the
                        decree of the district court.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>

                    <p>Messrs. Sanders &amp; Sons, merchants of Nassau, filed their memorial
                        claiming damages, in all $142,643, besides interest, for the alleged
                        wrongful capture and condemnation of the twenty-seven vessels above-named.
                            <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0173"/>Their memorial contained simply
                        a general averment that their vessels were lawfully engaged in trade “with
                        certain ports of the United States which were held open by the Government of
                        the United States to foreign commerce, and also with certain ports of Great
                        Britain and other nations.” That they were with their cargoes “unlawfully
                        and wrongfully captured, in violation of the law of nations,” by cruisers of
                        the United States, and condemned and sold. A schedule of the different
                        vessels, with copies of the respective registers, was filed with the
                        memorial. No other proofs were filed for the claimants, and the claim was
                        unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>The schooner Echo; Peter A. Spear water, claimant, No. 284.</p>
                    <p>The Echo was captured by a United States vessel of war on the 31st of May,
                        1863, on a voyage from Matamoras to New York; was taken into the port of Key
                        West; there libelled in the district court; by which court judgment of
                        restitution was awarded, certifying probable cause of capture, and refusing
                        costs or damages to the claimants. No appeal was taken and no reason was
                        assigned for the failure to appeal. In the testimony before the prize court
                        the mate of the vessel testified that the cargo was taken on board at the
                        mouth of the Rio Grande, and was purchased by the claimant himself in
                        Brownsville, Texas, a town of the Confederate States; that the Echo lay off
                        the mouth of the Rio Grande for about four months, from January till May,
                        1863; that, during most of that time, the claimant, the owner and master of
                        the vessel, was in Brownsville and there purchased the cotton in question.
                        The claimant himself, in his deposition denied these statements of his mate;
                        and the district judge deemed the evidence insufficient to justify
                        condemnation, but sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The bark Springbok; John Riley, manager, &amp;c, No. 442, claimant for
                        vessel; S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co. and Thomas Stirling Begbie, No. 316,
                        claimants for cargo.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured by a United States cruiser, on the 3d February,
                        1863, on the Atlantic Ocean, about one hundred and fifty miles east of
                        Nassau, New Providence; was taken into the port of New York, and there
                        libelled in the district court. That court rendered a decree of condemnation
                        of both vessel and cargo. (See the report of the case, B latch ford’s Prize
                        Cases, pp. 434 to 463.) The claimants appealed to the Supreme Court, which
                        affirmed the judgment of condemnation of the district court as to the cargo,
                        but reversed it as to the vessel, adjudging restitution of the vessel, but
                        without costs or damages to the claimants. (5 Wall, 1.)</p>
                    <p>The claimant John Riley, No. 442, claimed as manager of the London A 1
                        Insurance Association, the A 1 Guarantee Insurance Association, <pb n="118"
                            xml:id="pg_118" facs="0174"/>and the Colonial A 1 Insurance Association,
                        insurers of the vessel, and who had, on abandonment by the owners, paid as
                        for a total loss. He claimed an award for £4,615, besides interest, damages
                        for the detention of the vessel, loss of profits, and costs and expenses in
                        the prize-courts.</p>
                    <p>The claimants S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co., and Begbie, claimed £68,378, the
                        alleged value of the condemned cargo, and costs and expenses in the prize
                        courts. The facts of the case as appearing before the prize courts are
                        sufficiently set forth in the reports of the respective courts above
                        cited.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the proofs before the prize courts the claimants gave evidence
                        before the commission tending to show that the actual and ultimate
                        destination of the cargo was Nassau, and that it was intended to be there
                        sold in open market by the agent of the owners.</p>
                    <p>This evidence consisted of the testimony of the agent of the claimants at
                        Nassau to that effect, certain letters from the claimants to said agent
                        proved by him, and general proofs showing that there was at Nassau a market
                        for the various kinds of merchandise constituting the cargo of the
                        vessel.</p>
                    <p>Neither of the claimants for the cargo placed himself upon the stand to
                        testify as to the actual destination or the intent of the owners in relation
                        to it. The claimant Begbie was examined as a witness in behalf of Mr. Riley,
                        the claimant in No. 442; and, on his examination-in-chief, testified merely
                        that the cargo of the Springbok was to be discharged at Nassau; that there
                        was no agreement for the continuance of the voyage, or for the employment or
                        engagement of the vessel after her arrival at Nassau; and that the captain
                        of the vessel knew nothing of the ownership of the cargo. On
                        cross-examination he declined to answer as to whether he was, in the years
                        1862 or 1863, engaged in blockade-running speculations, and whether he was,
                        at the time of her capture, the owner of the Gertrude or her cargo, (this
                        being the vessel referred to in the report of the case in the Supreme Court,
                        and the proofs upon the condemnation of which were invoked in the case of
                        the Springbok.)</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States evidence was given showing both the firm of
                        S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co. and Begbie actively and largely engaged in
                        blockade-running ventures, and in supplying by contract the confederate
                        government with military supples. These proofs included original contracts
                        and letters between the claimants S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co. and the
                        confederate secretary of war, and other officials, showing contracts by that
                        firm, running through the years 1882 and 1863, for cannon, rifles, swords,
                        accoutrements, gunpowder, shells, clothing, &amp;c., in large quantities,
                        and delivery of the same to the confederate government under such contracts
                        to the amount of several hundred thousand pounds. Also evidence showing the
                        claimant Begbie a contractor with the confederate government for the
                        establishment of lines of fast steamers, to run in the service of that
                        government between the blockaded ports of the Confederate States and ports
                        in the West indies.</p>
                    <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0175"/>
                    <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that the proofs in the prize
                        court tailed to sustain the conclusions of the district court, that the
                        vessel “was knowingly laden in whole or in part with articles contraband of
                        war, with intent to deliver such articles to the aid and use of the enemy;”
                        that the true destination of the ship and cargo was not Nassau, a neutral
                        port, and for trade and commerce, but some port lawfully blockaded by the
                        forces of the United States, and with intent to violate such blockade; and,
                        further, that the papers of the vessel were simulated and false. That they
                        also failed to sustain the conclusions of the Supreme Court, “that the cargo
                        was originally shipped with an intent to violate the blockade; that the
                        owners of the cargo intended that it should be trans-shipped at Nassau into
                        some vessel more likely to succeed in reaching safely a blockaded port than
                        the Springbok; that the voyage from London to the blockaded port was, as to
                        cargo, both in law and in the intent of the parties, one voyage, and that
                        the liability to condemnation, if captured during any part of that voyage,
                        attached to the cargo from the time of sailing.”</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the claimants further contended that the proofs filed for the
                        first time before this commission conclusively rebutted these conclusions of
                        each of the prize courts, and established the ultimate destination of both
                        ship and cargo to be Nassau, the cargo to be there sold in open market.</p>
                    <p>The counsel called attention to an error in the opinion of the Supreme Court
                        in stating sixteen dozen swords and ten dozen rifle-bayonets as forming part
                        of the cargo of the Springbok, when in fact the proofs showed the vessel to
                        have carried only one sample-case containing one dozen cavalry-swords and
                        one dozen rifle-bayonets; and to the fact that, on the sale of the cargo,
                        the entire proceeds of the swords and bayonets, and of the army and navy
                        buttons, were only $270 out of the gross proceeds of the entire cargo of
                        nearly $250,000; and that, including the army blankets, saltpetre, and all
                        that portion of the cargo which could be regarded for any purpose as <hi
                            rend="italic">quasi</hi> contraband, the proceeds of such alleged
                        contraband goods were less than one per cent, of the proceeds of the entire
                        cargo. He urged that the judgment of the Supreme Court sustained “extreme
                        pretensions of belligerent right to subjugate neutral commerce to its
                        necessities,” which ought not to be sustained by this international
                        tribunal; that, to sustain the doctrine of liability to capture on the
                        theory of “continuous voyage,” it must appear that the cargo was intended as
                        a part of the original and planned adventure to be carried from the neutral
                        port to the enemy’s port; that the extreme doctrine in this regard had been
                        stated by the Supreme Court in the case of the Bermuda, (3 Wallace, 515,) as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>A voyage from a neutral to a belligerent port is one and the same
                                voyage, whether the destination be ulterior or direct, and whether
                                with or without the interposition of one or more intermediate ports,
                                and whether to be performed by one vessel or several employed in the
                                same transaction and in the accomplishment of the same purpose.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0176"/>
                    <p>That the measure of this doctrine, as applied by the Supreme Court to the
                        case of the Bermuda, was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>What has already been adduced of the evidence satisfies us completely
                                that the original destination of the Bermuda was to a blockaded
                                port; or, if otherwise, to an intermediate port, with intent to send
                                forward the cargo by trans-shipment into a vessel provided for the
                                completion of the voyage.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>That, with the doctrine of continuous voyage as thus limited and defined,
                        nothing in the case of the Springbok involves any necessary controversy; but
                        that this doctrine ought not to be extended so as to make guilty a trade
                        between neutral ports to which the intercepted voyage was actually and
                        really confined, by surmise, conjecture, or moral evidence not of a further
                        carriage and further carrier, but only of a probability that such
                        supplementary further carriage and <hi rend="italic">some</hi> supplementary
                        further carrier may or must have been included in the original scheme of the
                        commercial adventure. That such a fiction of continuous voyage for the case
                        of all trade between neutral ports, which has its stimulus from the state of
                        war, made the belligerent prize court master of neutral commerce, and in
                        fact established a paper blockade of the neutral ports in question, and left
                        their commerce at the mercy of the belligerent. That the whole history of
                        prize jurisdiction on the doctrine of continuous voyage shows that the
                        province of probable reasoning has been confined to the question of intent,
                        while the <hi rend="italic">corpus delicti</hi>—the voyage to the enemy
                        port—must be proved with the same definiteness of vehicle, port, and process
                        of execution as is confessedly essential when the voyage is direct and
                        simple.</p>
                    <p>That the original capture of the Springbok was wholly unjustifiable; that the
                        visitation and search disclosed nothing which rendered her voyage amenable
                        to further molestation; that there was nothing in the vessel, her cargo, or
                        her papers, her position, or the circumstances of her capture, justifying
                        the cruiser in sending the vessel into port for libel, on the speculation
                        that it might be that the cargo was to go forward, and, if so, that fact
                        perhaps might be provable; that it was a marked case of speculative seizure
                        and detention, not upon indications which the visit and search at sea
                        disclosed, but for the purpose of a visitation and search in the prize
                        courts for independent, extraneous, and argumentative grounds of
                        suspicion.</p>
                    <p>That the trial in the prize court violated the essential principles of the
                        prize jurisdiction as established between belligerents and neutrals, and in
                        which the latter find the limits of their exposure and submission. That the
                        rule of the prize courts that condemnation could only be justified upon the
                        proof furnished by the vessel itself, her papers, and cargo, and the
                        depositions of those on board, is not a mere matter of practice or form, but
                        is of the very essence of the administration of prize law. That,
                        accordingly, the invocation by the captors of the papers from the cases of
                        the Gertrude and Stephen Hart as part of the primary proofs on which to
                        condemn the Springbok and her cargo, was unprecedented, acknowledged <pb
                            n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0177"/>by the Supreme Court to be
                        irregular and not in accordance with the rules of proceeding in prize, and
                        was not a mere irregularity in form but was subversive of the principles of
                        prize jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>That the passing of condemnation without giving the claimants an opportunity
                        for further proof, was a manifest injustice; and that the absolute
                        condemnation without such opportunity for further proofs was contrary to the
                        rightful system of prize jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>That the presence of the trivial amount of contraband (as held by the prize
                        court) could not be regarded either as evidence of its own destination or of
                        that of its accompanying innocent cargo to an ulterior market, nor as ground
                        for condemnation independent of the question of intended breach of blockade;
                        citing on this point Dr. Gessner’s <hi rend="italic">Droit des Neutres sur
                            Mer</hi>, p. 122, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>It is wrong to seize contraband goods in a neutral vessel when they
                                are in such small quantities that their inoffensive character is

                    <p>On the part of the claimants of the vessel it was contended, in addition to
                        the positions above stated, that it was found by the Supreme Court that her
                        papers were regular and her voyage a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> one
                        between London and Nassau; that the papers were all genuine, and there was
                        no concealment of any of them, and no spoliation; that the owners were
                        neutrals, appeared to have no interest in the cargo, and could have had no
                        knowledge of its alleged unlawful destination; that these conclusions of the
                        Supreme Court upon the evidence before it were strengthened and completely
                        sustained by the additional testimony taken before the commission; that the
                        grounds on which the Supreme Court denied costs and damages to the claimants
                        of the vessel, to wit? misrepresentation by the master on his examination as
                        to his lack of knowledge of the grounds on which the capture was made, and
                        the fact that he had signed bills of lading which did not state truly and
                        fully the nature of the goods contained in the bales and cases mentioned in
                        them, were unsustained as matters of fact by the evidence, and, even if
                        sustained, were in themselves not of the least significance, and did not and
                        could not affect the interests or issues involved in the capture? that, so
                        far as the vessel and her owners were concerned, her voyage was <pb n="122"
                            xml:id="pg_122" facs="0178"/>honest, her papers fair, and the good faith
                        of the charter-party absolute and unimpeachable, and the declarations and
                        conduct of her captain not so obnoxious to just criticism as to justify the
                        infliction of punishment upon the innocent owners.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the conclusions
                        arrived at by the Supreme Court as above stated, and upon which the decree
                        of that court condemning the cargo was based, were fully sustained by the
                        evidence before the prize court. That the claimants of the cargo had, by the
                        judgment of the Supreme Court, full notice of the grounds on which the cargo
                        was condemned, those grounds relating principally to their own previous
                        conduct in furnishing military supplies to the confederate government and in
                        running the blockade, and to the presumption raised by the circumstances of
                        the case as to their own design and intention in regard to the destination
                        of the cargo. That, notwithstanding this notice, they had failed to avail
                        themselves of the opportunity afforded them before the commission to testily
                        as to the facts and conclusions thus found by the Supreme Court; and that in
                        the case of Mr. Begbie, when placed upon the stand involuntarily, he had
                        refused to answer concerning these very matters. That this failure and
                        refusal to testify on the part of the claimants was to be taken as in effect
                        an admission of the correctness of the conclusions of the court.</p>
                    <p>That by the evidence adduced before the commission the fact was fully
                        established that all these claimants of the cargo were extensively engaged
                        in running the blockade, and also in furnishing military supplies to the
                        enemy. That the facts thus proved went strongly to confirm the conclusions
                        of the court that the cargo was destined and intended for trans-shipment to
                        and delivery in the Confederate States, and not for a market at Nassau. That
                        they also established that these claimants legally and morally were not
                        neutrals, but enemies of the United States actually engaged in the
                        prosecution of the war against those States: and that, as such, their
                        property on the high seas was liable to capture without regard to the
                        question of blockade. That the question of national character in such case
                        was always a question of the individual national character of the owner, and
                        not of his national character as established by paramount allegiance, citing
                        the Anna Catherina, 4 Rob., 119$ the Vigilantia, 1 <hi rend="italic"
                            >id.</hi>, 1; the Vriendschap, 4 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 166, and
                        the authorities cited in 3 Phillimore, 605, 606. That these proofs also
                        precluded the claimants from a standing before this commission as neutral
                        British subjects. That as to the vessel, the capture and condemnation of the
                        cargo being lawful, the seizure of the vessel and taking her into port was
                        also lawful as the sole means of reaching the cargo which was lawful prize,
                        and that in such case the vessel was not entitled to costs or damages.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim for the cargo in No. 316. In
                        the claim for the vessel, No. 442, they unanimously awarded to the claimant
                        the sum of $5,065. I am advised that this award was made in respect of the
                        detention of the vessel from the date of the <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123"
                            facs="0179"/>decree of the district court to the date of her discharge
                        under the decree of the Supreme Court, the latter decree having established
                        that the vessel should have been discharged by the decree of the district
                        court.</p>
                    <p>The steamship M. S. Perry, alias Salvor; John McLennan, claimant, No.
                        370.</p>
                    <p>This vessel, then known as the Salvor, was owned at the breaking out of the
                        rebellion by James McKay, a citizen of Florida. In September, 18.61, McKay
                        took her to Havana, and there went through the form of a sale of the vessel
                        to McLennan, the present claimant, who caused her to be registered in his
                        name at the British consulate at Havana, and re-christened her the M. S.
                        Perry. A bill of sale was given by McKay to McLennan, specifying the nominal
                        consideration of $32,000. On the 13th October, 1861, she sailed from Havana
                        with the ostensible destination of Nassau, but with written instructions to
                        go to the main-land of Florida and there land Donald McKay, a son of the
                        former owner, who went as a passenger, together with several negro slaves of
                        the former owner, McKay. McKay, senior, himself sailed with her for Nassau?
                        holding a power of attorney from McLennan, authorizing him to collect the
                        freight at Nassau.</p>
                    <p>She was captured on the night of the 13th October, at a point between the Dry
                        Tortugas and the coast of Florida, being headed for the western coast of the
                        peninsula of Florida, and in a position quite wide of the proper course to
                        Nassau, and separated from that port by the whole width of the peninsula of
                        Florida and the waters intervening between that peninsula and the Bahamas.
                        She was taken into the port of Philadelphia, there libelled in the district
                        court, condemned, and sold. No appeal was taken from the judgment of the
                        prize court; but the commission held, as has been already stated, the
                        reasons assigned for the failure to appeal sufficient. The proofs taken
                        before the prize court were not put in evidence before the commission.</p>
                    <p>From the testimony taken before the commission, it appeared that McLennan was
                        a merchant’s clerk in Havana, not engaged in shipping, and owning no
                        interest in any other vessel than the M. S. Perry. When examined himself as
                        a witness, McLennan refused to say whether he possessed any property or
                        money to enable him to make such a purchase; but it appeared that he gave
                        McKay his promissory notes for the amount of the purchase-money at six,
                        twelve, and eighteen months, without any security for their payment by
                        mortgage on the vessel or otherwise. It did not appear that anything had
                        ever been paid on the notes; and the claimant, when asked on
                        cross-examination whether they had ever been paid, declined to answer. McKay
                        remained in the sole actual management of the vessel after the sale, and
                        employed the captain, the chief engineer, and the ship broker who obtained
                        her freight. McKay also held a power of attorney from McLennan to recover
                        and receive whatever indemnity or compensation should be awarded by the
                        commission <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0180"/>in the premises; he
                        verified the memorial filed by the claimant; and he alone appeared to have
                        procured the attendance of witnesses, and to have prosecuted the case before
                        the commission.</p>
                    <p>A considerable portion of the cargo of the M. S. Perry, upon her capture,
                        consisted of arms and ammunition, of the ownership of which no proof was
                        made, and for which no claim was prosecuted before the commission.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that these facts clearly
                        indicated the pretended sale by McKay to McLennan to be colorable merely,
                        and that upon them the claimant had shown no title to recover; that the
                        direction to the vessel to land young McKay and the negro slaves on the
                        coast of Florida was an attempt to violate the blockade, and justified the
                        capture; that the omission of the claimant to produce the testimony before
                        the prize court left the judgment of that court to be presumed fully
                        sustained by the evidence, and that in the absence of that evidence the
                        commission could not declare the judgment erroneous.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The steamship Granite City; Edward Pembroke, claimant, No. 377.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured on the 22d March, 1863, on a voyage from Nassau, at
                        which port she had cleared nominally for Saint John’s, New Brunswick. She
                        had shortly before taken a cargo of merchandise from Nassau, through the
                        blockade, to Wilmington, N. C, and succeeded in getting through safely,
                        though fired at by the blockaders, and had also succeeded in running out a
                        cargo of cotton through the blockade. In his deposition <hi rend="italic">in
                            preparatorio</hi>, her master, after repeated refusals to state to what
                        port the vessel was actually bound at the time of her capture, finally
                        voluntarily stated, at the end of his deposition, “that he was bound to run
                        the blockade into some confederate port wherever he could get in; and if he
                        could not get in, to go elsewhere.” The proof was unquestioned that she was
                        captured in the prosecution of a voyage designed to violate the blockade.
                        During the pursuit by the captors, and immediately before the capture, a
                        package of papers, of whose contents the captain professed himself ignorant,
                        was burned by his orders.</p>
                    <p>She was libelled in the United States district court for the southern
                        district of New York, and a decree of condemnation was rendered by that
                        court. (See report of the case, Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 355–357.) Pending
                        the proceedings in the district court, and before the decree of
                        condemnation, the vessel was taken for the use of the United States at an
                        appraised value, under the United States statute of March 3, 1863. (12 Stat,
                        at L., 759.) The cargo was sold under the decree. The claimant alleged
                        himself the owner of the vessel and cargo, and claimed damages, $462,000,
                        besides interest. No appeal was taken from the decree of the district court.
                        The claimant filed, under the order of the commission, a statement of the
                        reasons for his failure to appeal, alleging in effect <pb n="125"
                            xml:id="pg_125" facs="0181"/>that the decree of condemnation was by
                        default, the claimant not having appeared in the prize court, and that, the
                        vessel having been taken by the United States, he had no funds, or means of
                        securing funds, wherewith to appeal.</p>
                    <p>The case was decided without a specific decision upon the sufficiency of
                        these reasons.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the capture was illegal, in
                        that the vessel had received no warning, and that she was captured on the
                        high seas, and not in the act of violating the blockade by crossing that
                        part of the sea which had been conquered by the blockading power. That the
                        declarations of the master, as to the object and intent of the voyage, did
                        not constitute the offence of violating the blockade, nor authorize the
                        capture. That the fact of the former running of the blockade was not to be
                        taken as proof of the illicit character of the voyage in the course of which
                        she was captured. That the spoliation of papers shown did not constitute
                        sufficient ground of condemnation, and generally that the grounds of
                        condemnation assigned by the court were insufficient under well-settled
                        principles of international law, and without precedent in maritime
                        jurisprudence. That the prosecution of an appeal from the decision of the
                        prize court was not necessary to lay the foundation for reclamation before
                        the commission. That the appropriation of the vessel to the use of the
                        United States before condemnation was an unlawful act, and of itself gave
                        sufficient ground for reclamation. That that act deprived the prize court of
                        jurisdiction, the proceeding being <hi rend="italic">in rem</hi>, and the
                        subject of the litigation, therefore, must necessarily be before the court,
                        in order to sustain their jurisdiction.</p>

                    <p>The commission unanimously, and without hearing any argument for the United
                        States, disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The bark Empress; John Loft, mortgagee, claimant, No. 387.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured off the mouth of the Mississippi River, in November,
                        1861, sent into the port of New York, and there libelled for <pb n="126"
                            xml:id="pg_126" facs="0182"/>adjudication as prize in the district
                        court. The district court adjudged condemnation of vessel and cargo,
                        (Blatehford’s Prize Cases, 175.) An appeal was taken to the circuit court of
                        the United States for the same district, under the practice then existing,
                        which court reversed the judgment of the district court and awarded
                        restitution, (<hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 659,) but without costs or damages
                        to the claimants. Pending the proceedings in the prize court the vessel was
                        sold and the proceeds, less the costs taxed against the same, were paid into
                        the hands of the proctors of the claimants in the prize court, Pearson and
                        others, the owners of the vessel.</p>
                    <p>The memorial alleged that this money was attached in the hands of the
                        proctors by creditors of Pearson, and that Pearson’s interest in the same
                        was appropriated to the payment of the debts due from him to the attaching
                        creditors. The claimant, Loft, alleged himself the holder of a mortgage
                        given by the owner, Pearson, to him to secure the sum of £1,000 and
                        interest, which mortgage was wholly due and unpaid. It alleged that the
                        claimant had never received any notice of the capture of the bark, except as
                        he learned the fact from the owners some time after the capture, and that he
                        was then informed by the owners that they were taking the necessary and
                        proper steps in the law courts for the purpose of protecting their
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The memorial also alleged that the bark, at the time of her capture, was
                        worth the sum of £1,000, and that it became largely depreciated in value by
                        being suffered to remain without repairs, and without proper care being
                        taken of it during the time it was detained prior to the sale. The claimant
                        claimed the amount of his mortgage, £1,000 and interest.</p>
                    <p>His counsel contended that the decree of the circuit court having ordered the
                        restitution of the vessel to the claimants free of all costs and charges, it
                        was plain that that decree had not been executed, over $2,000 having been
                        retained from the proceeds as costs and charges, and the proofs failing to
                        show that the remainder of the proceeds even were ever paid over in any
                        manner under the decree of the court.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States, it was contended that from the memorial
                        itself it appeared that the proceeds of the vessel were regularly paid over
                        to the proctors of the owners, the only claimants appearing in the prize
                        court, excepting only costs allowed by the court as claimants’ costs out of
                        the fund. That it further appeared from the memorial that these funds thus
                        paid over to the proctors were appropriated by regular judicial process to
                        the payment of claims of attaching creditors of the owners. That, if the
                        claimant, Loft, as mortgagee, had a valid lien upon the vessel, that lien
                        could have been followed against the proceeds due, had he seen fit to take
                        the necessary steps for that purpose; and that behaving failed to do so, his
                        lien had been lost by his own negligence. That, as to the sum withheld for
                        costs, nothing appeared to show that that sum was excessive in amount, or
                        was improperly withheld; and that if such had been the case, the remedy of
                        the claimant <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0183"/>or of his mortgagor,
                        who represented his interests before the prize court, was ample before the
                        courts themselves. That the whole case showed no ground of international
                        reclamation on behalf of this claimant.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The steamships Sunbeam, Eagle, Greyhound, Lilian, Lucy, Emma Henry; also, the
                        steamers Banshee, Tristram Shandy; Henry Lafone and John T. Lawrence, No.
                        389, claimants for the six first named, and John T. Lawrence, No. 431,
                        claimant for the two latter.</p>
                    <p>These vessels were captured at different times in 1862, 1863, and 1864, by
                        war vessels of the United States, and duly condemned in the prize courts of
                        original jurisdiction. No question was made but that they were all at the
                        time of capture engaged in voyages intended for violation of the blockade.
                        No appeals were taken from the prize courts of original jurisdiction before
                        which they were respectively condemned. The claimants filed their reasons
                        for failure to appeal, in which they alleged poverty and destitution of
                        means to defray the expense of appeal, ignorance of the circumstances of the
                        capture, imprisonment of the masters and crews, and previous adverse
                        decisions by the Supreme Court in like cases, as the excuses for
                        non-appeal.</p>
                    <p>No specific ruling was made by the commission on the sufficiency of these
                        reasons, but the cases were submitted on their merits, the only claim on the
                        part of the claimants being that they were respectively entitled to formal
                        notice and warning by a blockading vessel before they could be subjected to
                        capture. This question was not argued, and the commission unanimously
                        disallowed the claims.</p>
                    <p>The brig Geziena Heligonda; Walter Easton, trustee, claimant, No. 390.</p>
                    <p>This was a Dutch vessel, sailing under charter-party to the firm of
                        Galbraith, Red gate &amp; Co., of Glasgow and Matamoras, for a voyage from
                        Liverpool to Matamoras and back. She was captured on the 4th December, 1864,
                        on the outward voyage, within the blockaded waters of the coast of Texas,
                        and off the port of Brazos Santiago, situated some ten to fifteen miles
                        north of the mouth of the Rio Grande; was taken into the port of New Orleans
                        and there libelled, and in that court a decree of condemnation was rendered
                        on the 2d February, 1865. The claimant applied for a rehearing in the
                        district court, which was granted, and further proof allowed. Jansen, the
                        Dutch master of the brig, was then re-examined in his own language, with the
                        aid of an interpreter; and on the 25th March, 1865, the judgment of
                        condemnation before rendered was annulled, and judgment of restitution
                        awarded, certifying reasonable cause of seizure, and refusing costs and
                        damages to claimant. From this decree both parties appealed, Captain Jansen
                        representing the owners of both vessel and cargo. The Supreme Court, on the
                        hearing, and without any written opinion, unanimously affirmed the decree in
                        all respects.</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0184"/>
                    <p>The claim here was brought by Easton as trustee under a trust deed for the
                        benefit of creditors executed by the firm of Galbraith, Redgate &amp; Co.,
                        the alleged owners of the cargo. Samuel J. Redgate, one of the members of
                        this firm, and who was also the claimant in case No. 420, hereinbefore
                        reported, and one of the beneficiaries in No. 439, hereafter reported under
                        the head of the Peterhoff, appeared to be a citizen of the United States.
                        The vessel, when first seen, was not only within the blockaded waters of
                        Texas, but was apparently seeking to effect an entrance into the inlet of
                        Brazos Santiago. Prom the proofs taken in the prize court, however, it was
                        evident that there was no intention to violate the blockade, and that
                        Captain Jansen was seeking to effect this entrance under the mistaken
                        impression that it was the mouth of the Rio Grande. The cargo of the vessel,
                        though containing nothing strictly contraband of war, was in large part
                        fitted and apparently designed for the confederate markets.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the circumstances
                        under which the vessel was captured sufficiently justified the capture as
                        one of “probable cause,” and that no ground existed for overruling or
                        questioning the judgment of the United States courts upon the case.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was insisted that a proper and reasonable
                        examination of the books and papers of the vessel, together with the
                        explanation of her position given by her officers, ought to have fully
                        satisfied the captors of her innocent intent, and to have prevented her
                        detention and taking into port for libel.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>The steamship Adela; Arthur Bower For wood and James Dorrington, No. 392,
                        claimants for the vessel; Arthur Bower For wood and William Bower Forwood,
                        No. 393, claimants for cargo.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured on the 7th July, 1862, near the island of Abaco, one
                        of the Bahama Islands, and a possession of Her Britannic Majesty, in a
                        voyage from Liverpool ostensibly to Nassau. She was taken into the port of
                        Key West, and there libelled in the district court, and a decree of
                        condemnation of both vessel and cargo was there rendered. The claimants
                        appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the judgment of
                        the district court was affirmed. (See report of the case, 6 Wall., 266.)</p>
                    <p>The Adela was a small side-wheel steamer of light draught, fleet, well
                        adapted for service as a blockade-runner and for short trips like those
                        between Nassau and Charleston or Savannah, but unfit for carrying on trade
                        in voyages of the length of that from Liverpool to Nassau. Her cargo on the
                        outward voyage was light, consisting only of twenty cases of Enfield rifles
                        and twenty-five boxes of cartridges, which had been discharged at Bermuda
                        before her capture, and of some <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0185"
                        />fifty, packages of boots and shoes, which were captured and condemned, and
                        which were the subject of the claim in No. 393.</p>
                    <p>This claim for the cargo, in No. 393, was withdrawn by the claimants by leave
                        of the commission after the completion of the claimants’ proofs. In No. 392
                        proofs were taken before the commission in addition to those taken in the
                        prize court, which were also put before the commission.</p>
                    <p>The position of the Adela, when first summoned by the capturing vessel, as
                        well as when actually captured, was a matter of dispute upon the facts of
                        the case, the witnesses on the part of the claimant giving evidence tending
                        to show that when first summoned, as well as when actually captured, she was
                        within a marine league of the shores of the island of Abaco, while the
                        evidence on the part of the defence tended to show that at both times she
                        was more than that distance from the shore and upon the high seas.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that there was no sufficient
                        proof of the Adela being engaged in an unlawful voyage; and also that the
                        capture, being made within British and neutral waters, was unlawful and
                        void, and the owners entitled to make reclamation.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the preponderance of
                        the evidence was in favor of the lawfulness of the capture as made upon the
                        high seas, and not in the neutral waters of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the United States urged that the doctrine of the sovereignty
                        of the proprietary nation over the sea for a marine league from the shore is
                        founded in the idea of a proper and necessary protection to the adjacent
                        coasts, and to the vessels resorting to them for legitimate trade. That in
                        its original inception this doctrine never included the idea that a vessel
                        engaged in an unlawful voyage might protect herself from capture, to which
                        she would be subject on the high seas, by merely skirting the coast of a
                        harborless and substantially uninhabited island, such as the island of
                        Abaco. That although strictly and technically the coast of such an island
                        might be within the protection of the rule, it was only technically so; and
                        that where a claim is set up for the protection of a vessel actually engaged
                        in an unlawful voyage, and claiming a capture otherwise lawful to be made
                        unlawful by reason of being within a marine league of the shore of such an
                        island, a judicial tribunal should require strict and conclusive proof to
                        bring the vessel within the technical rule, and to satisfy them that the
                        neutrality of the proprietary nation had been in fact violated. That the
                        burden of proof, therefore, devolved strictly and onerously upon the
                        claimants; and that on the evidence appearing in this case it would be,
                        unjust to resolve any doubts which the commission might have in this regard
                        in favor of the claimants.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                        to pass through the blockading fleet on an outward voyage from Richmond,
                        Va., for Liverpool. She was taken into the port of New York, and vessel and
                        cargo there libelled in the United States district court, and condemned.
                        (See report of the case in that court, Blatchford’s Prize Cases, p. 1.) On
                        appeal, first to the circuit court and thence to the Supreme Court, the
                        decree of the district court was affirmed, the opinion of the Supreme Court
                        being delivered by Mr. Justice Crier, and a dissenting opinion being read by
                        Mr. Justice Nelson, in which Chief Justice Taney and Justices Catron and
                        Clifford concurred. (See report in the Supreme Court under title of “The
                        Prize Cases,” 2 Black, 635 to 699.)</p>
                    <p>This was one of the first vessels captured during the war, and one of the
                        first upon the validity of whose capture adjudications were had in the prize
                        courts of both, original and appellate jurisdiction. In the Supreme Court,
                        where the case was argued in connection with those of several other vessels
                        captured about the same time, and involving to some extent the same general
                        principles, the question of the validity of the blockade established under
                        the President’s proclamations of 19th and 27th April, 1861, (12 Stat, at L.,
                        1258, 1259,) and that of the liability of the property of persons domiciled
                        within the insurrectionary States to capture on the high seas as enemy’s
                        property, were elaborately argued. The majority of the court sustained the
                        validity of the blockade and the right of capture of property of citizens of
                        the insurrectionary States upon the high seas as enemy’s property. The
                        minority of the court held “that no civil war-existed between the United
                        States and the States in insurrection till recognized by the act of Congress
                        of 13th July, 1861, (12 Stat, at L., 255;) that the President of the United
                        States does not possess the power under the Constitution to declare war or
                        recognize its existence within the meaning of the law of nations, which
                        carries with it belligerent rights, and thus change the country and all its
                        citizens from, a state of peace to a state of war; that this power belongs
                        exclusively to the Congress of the United States, and, consequently, that
                        the President had no power to set on foot a blockade under the law of
                        nations; and that the capture of the vessel and cargo in this case and in
                        all cases before us in which the capture occurred before the 13th July,
                        1861, for breach of blockade or as enemy’s property, are illegal and void,
                        and that the decrees of condemnation should be reversed, and the vessel and
                        cargo restored.” (2 Black, 698, 699.)</p>
                    <p>The case of the Hiawatha was this: She sailed from Liverpool on the 11th
                        February, 1861, with a cargo of salt for Richmond, Va., thence <pb n="131"
                            xml:id="pg_131" facs="0187"/>to take cargo back to Liverpool. She passed
                        Hampton Roads, at the mouth of the James River, on the 23d April, and
                        arrived at City Point, the port of Richmond, a few miles below that city on
                        the James River, on the 29th April. She completed the discharge of her
                        outward cargo on the 10th May; immediately commenced lading with her return
                        cargo, (consisting principally of tobacco,) and completed this lading on the
                        14th or 15th May. On the 16th she weighed anchor and attempted to go to sea
                        without pilot or steam-tug, but was prevented by headwinds. On the 17th a
                        tug attempted to take her out of harbor, but was prevented by the breaking
                        of the tow-line. On the 18th she was taken in tow by another steamer and
                        towed down the river to within about twenty miles of Hampton Roads. From
                        this point she floated down with the tide toward the Roads, and on the 20th
                        was boarded by an officer from a United States blockading vessel, who
                        endorsed upon her register this notice: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>This vessel (the Hiawatha) has been boarded by the United States
                                blockading squadron, and warned not to enter any port in Virginia or
                                south of it.</p>

                    <p>On the same day, and while still floating with the tide in Hampton Roads, she
                        was seized by the United States war-steamer Minnesota, and thereafter taken
                        into port and libelled, as above recited.</p>
                    <p>President Lincoln’s proclamation establishing blockade of the ports of
                        Virginia was issued 27th April, 1861, (12 Stat, at L., 1259.) Under that
                        proclamation the blockade of the ports of Virginia upon the Chesapeake Bay
                        and the James River was actually established by Commodore Pendergrast, and a
                        proclamation made of same on the 30th April. On the 8th May, Lord Lyons
                        communicated to Mr. Seward a letter from the British consul at Richmond,
                        dated 5th May, in which the consul had said to Lord Lyons: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>There are parties here about to load the British ship Hiawatha at
                                City Point for Liverpool, under the impression that she will be
                                allowed free egress by the blockading squadron. I have told persons
                                who are here representing the owners of the ship that I see no
                                difficulty to the ship leaving in ballast; but to this they will not
                                consent, as the ship came here expressly’ from Liverpool at a
                                nominal freight to load a remunerative cargo back.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Lord Lyons stated to Mr. Seward the hardship of the case of the Hiawatha, in
                        case she should be compelled to return home in ballast in consequence of the
                        blockade, of which, of course, her owners could have had no knowledge when
                        they sent her out, and submitted the case for the consideration of the
                        Government of the United States, requesting an early answer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Seward answered on the 9th May, enclosing a letter from the Secretary of
                        the Navy, in which he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Fifteen days have been specified as a limit for neutrals to leave the
                                ports, after actual blockade has commenced, with or without cargo,
                                and there are yet remaining five <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"

                                diligence on the part of persons interested, I see no reason for

                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Lord Lyons again wrote Mr. Seward on the 9th May, acknowledging the receipt
                        of Mr. Seward’s letter, and saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>In order to avoid all possible mistake with regard to the Hiawatha,
                                as well as to future cases of the same kind, I venture to request
                                you to inform me whether I am right in concluding, from the
                                statement just quoted, that the date of the shipment of the cargo is
                                immaterial, and that vessels leaving the ports, before the
                                expiration of the fifteen days will be allowed to proceed with their
                                cargoes, whether such cargoes were shipped before or after the
                                actual beginning of the effective blockade.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>This letter was answered by Mr. Seward on May 11, enclosing another letter
                        from the Secretary of the Navy, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>In answer to Lord Lyons’s letter of the 9th instant, I have the honor

                                leave port after the actual establishment of the blockade, whether
                                such vessels are with or without cargoes.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Lord Lyons responded to Mr. Seward on May 11, thanking him for his prompt
                        information, reciting the correspondence, and saying: <quote

                            <p>I have, consequently, instructed Her Majesty’s consuls to advise

                                board as well after as before the commencement of the blockade, and
                                that they will be allowed fifteen days to go to sea, whether with or
                                without cargoes, and whether their cargoes be shipped before or
                                after the actual commencement of the effective blockade.</p>

                    <p>On the same day Lord Lyons sent to the British consuls at Richmond and other

                    <p>He also sent, on the same day, a dispatch to Rear-Admiral Sir A. Milne, of

                    <p>In the decision of the cause in the district court, Judge Betts expressed the
                        opinion that the correspondence between Mr. Seward and Lord Lyons did not
                        constitute any relaxation of the general rule limiting the right of
                        departure of neutral vessels from a blockaded port to such cargo as had been
                        laden before receiving notice of the blockade; so that, if the Hiawatha had
                        departed within the fifteen days allowed for departure after the
                        establishment of the blockade, she would not have been entitled to take out
                        the cargo laden after knowledge of the blockade, (Blatchford’s Prize Oases,
                        p. 20.) The Supreme Court, however, distinctly overruled Judge Betts upon
                        this point, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>After a careful examination of the correspondence of the State and
                                Navy Departments, found in the record, we are not satisfied that the
                                British minister erred in the construction he put upon it, which was
                                that a license was given to all vessels in the blockaded ports to
                                depart with their cargoes within fifteen days after the blockade was
                                established, whether the cargoes were taken on board before or after
                                the notice of the blockade. All reasonable doubts should be resolved
                                in favor of the claimants. Any other course would be inconsistent

                    <p>The British consul at Richmond gave to the master of the Hiawatha, on the
                        15th May, a certificate stating that, according to the best information
                        attainable by him, the effective blockade at the mouth of the James River
                        began on the 2d May. After the capture of the vessel, correspondence ensued
                        between Lord Lyons and Mr. Seward, in which Lord Lyons earnestly recommended
                        the case of the Hiawatha to the favorable consideration of the United States
                        Government, saying that it appeared “that the master of this vessel was
                        innocent of any intention to break the blockade, and that his not having
                        passed the blockading squadron earlier was due to erroneous information or
                        unavoidable detentions,” He also called attention to the cases of the Haxall
                        and the Octavia, and expressed the hope that the Government of the United
                        States would be disposed to extend to the Hiawatha the same favor which had
                        been shown to those vessels.</p>
                    <p>In another letter to Mr. Seward, Lord Lyons said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>In cases No. 400 and 401, the memorials failed to show the respective
                        claimants the owners of the portions of the cargo claimed by them, but
                        showed those portions respectively to be the property of one David Dunlop, a
                        resident of Petersburgh, Va., who was shipping them to the claimants in
                        performance of executory contracts between him and the respective claimants
                        for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Wm. T. Marshall, No. 402, the memorial showed that the
                        claimant was, at the time of the capture, domiciled in Richmond, Va.</p>
                    <p>Demurrers were interposed in those cases, specifying these respective

                    <p>In the case of McEwen’s executors, No. 452, the proofs showed the testator
                        domiciled at Richmond down to about the time of the capture; but about that
                        time, the proofs failing to show whether shortly before or shortly after, he
                        returned to the domicile of his nativity in Great Britain, where he ever
                        after remained until his death.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that, irrespective of the
                        strict rule of prize law applicable to the case of the Hiawatha, the case
                        was one where in “justice and equity" the claimants were entitled to
                        indemnity, being without intentional fault, and morally, at least, innocent
                        of any intention to violate the blockade, or do any illegal or prohibited
                        act; that the master of the vessel had used the utmost diligence in lading
                        his vessel within the time which he was informed he was entitled to consume
                        in lading it, and had been prevented from reaching Hampton Roads within the
                        time limited, by causes beyond his control; that he ought not to be made to
                        suffer for the accidents that had deprived him of the services of a pilot
                        and the aid of steam, nor for the winds that retarded the progress of his
                        ship to sea, nor by reason of the master’s failure, in the emergency of an
                        unexpected war, to understand the exact legal significance of proclamations
                        of the President, and the legal consequences of blockade; that at the time
                        of the capture no war existed between the United States and the Confederate
                        States, by virtue of which the blockade of the confederate ports could be
                        lawfully established; that no such war could be taken as existing until
                        recognized by the act of Congress of 13th July, 1861; that consequently the
                        President had no power to set on foot a blockade of the ports in question
                        under the law of nations prior to the 13th July, 1861; that the capture of
                        the Hiawatha and her cargo, whether for breach of blockade or as enemy’s
                        property, was illegal and void; and that by the terms of the President’s
                        proclamation the vessel was entitled to a warning indorsed on her papers by
                        an officer of the blockading force, and was not liable to capture except for
                        an attempt to leave port after such warning.</p>
                    <p>As part of his argument, the counsel for the claimant cited and adopted the
                        dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson in “The prize cases,” (2 Black,
                        682.) He cited also the case of the Neptunus, (3 Rob., 110, 173; and
                        Medeiros vs. Hill, 8 Bing., 231.)</p>
                    <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0191"/>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that, as a matter of fact,
                        war actually existed between the United States and the Confederate States at
                        and from the dates of the respective proclamations of blockade by the
                        President on the 19th and 27th April, 1861, Virginia having seceded by
                        ordinance of her convention on the 20th April, and having actually and
                        formally joined the Confederate States on the 27tk April. That, war thus
                        existing, the establishment of a blockade was within the constitutional
                        powers of the President as the chief executive officer of the United States
                        and commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy. That certainly as to foreign
                        nations his acts were to be regarded fully and completely as the acts of the
                        United States, and the establishment of a blockade by him was its
                        establishment by the nation. That the validity of the blockade so
                        established by him was unquestioned by the Congress which met after the
                        issuing of the proclamation, and while it was in the course of enforcement;
                        and that it was expressly legalized by the statute of 6th August, 1861,
                        which legalized and made valid the President’s acts, proclamations, and
                        orders, after the 4th March, 1861, “respecting the Army and Navy of the
                        United States * * with the same effect as if they had been issued and done
                        under the previous express authority and direction of the Congress of the
                        United States.” (12 Stat, at L., 326.) That the validity of this blockade
                        had been fully recognized by the British government as well as all other
                        foreign powers as effectual and valid; citing the correspondence of Lord
                        Lyons, above recited, and Prof. Bernard’s “Neutrality,” &amp;c., p. 231 <hi
                            rend="italic">n</hi>. That the proclamation of the President did not
                        modify or assume to modify the law of blockade as held by the rules of
                        international law; and that it was only in case of a vessel innocently
                        approaching the blockaded port without notice, that she was entitled to be
                        duly warned off before becoming a subject of capture; citing on this point
                        the Columbia, 1 Rob. 156; the Vrow Judith, <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 152;
                        the Betsey, <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 332; the Adelaide, 2 <hi

                        Bernard’s Neutrality, p. 236. That the misapprehension of legal rights by
                        the master of the Hiawatha could not be taken into account as excusing his
                        action in attempting to pass out through the blockade after the expiration
                        of the time allowed him by the rules of international law, and by the
                        specific notice contained in the diplomatic correspondence above recited for
                        that purpose. And that the accidents by which the claimants attempted to
                        excuse the failure of the Hiawatha to leave within the permitted time could
                        not be held to make her departure lawful, or exempt her from capture.</p>
                    <p>As to the argument of the claimant’s counsel in favor of the rights of the
                        claimant before this commission, under general principles of justice and
                        equity outside of and beyond the principles of international law as held by
                        the prize courts, the counsel for the United States held the same general
                        line of argument as above reported under the case of the Sir William Peel,
                        No. 243; and insisted that the fact of the Government <pb n="136"
                            xml:id="pg_136" facs="0192"/>of the United States having remitted its
                        lawful claims for its own reasons in the cases of the Tropic Wind, the
                        Octavia, and the Haxall, certainly could not be taken as any reason for
                        enforcing as matter of right the same generosity in the case of the
                        Hiawatha.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claims of Watkins &amp; Leigh, No.
                        400, and of Dalgetty, Du Croz &amp; Co., No. 401, on the ground that the
                        ownership of the portions of the cargo claimed by them respectively did not
                        appear to be in them but in a citizen of the United States. They also
                        unanimously disallowed the claim of Win. T. Marshall, No. 402, it appearing
                        that he was permanently domiciled in the city of Richmond within the enemy’s
                        country.</p>
                    <p>It made awards in favor of the claimants for the vessel in Nos. 398 and 399,

                    <p>This vessel was captured on the 25th February, 1863, in the Atlantic Ocean,
                        off the Island of St. Thomas, taken into the port of New York, and there
                        libelled as prize in the United States district court. A decree of
                        condemnation passed in that court against both vessel and cargo. (See
                        Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 381,463, to 550.) An appeal was taken to the
                        Supreme Court, which court reversed the decree of condemnation by the
                        district court, except as to a small portion of the cargo, found by that
                        court to be contraband of war, and intended for the ultimate use of the
                        enemies of the United States, and belonging to the claimants in cases Nos.
                        408, 409, and 411, and except also so much of the remaining cargo of the
                        Peterhoff as belonged to the owners of the contraband goods thus condemned.
                        The cause was thereupon remanded to the district court by the Supreme Court,
                        with directions to enter a decree in conformity to the opinion of the
                        Supreme Court. Pending the proceedings in the prize courts, the vessel was
                        taken by the authorities of the United States, for the use of the
                        government, under the statute for that purpose above referred to under the
                        case of the Granite City, No. 377. The cargo was also sold by order of the
                        district court, pending the proceedings. On the remanding of the cause to
                        the district court, proofs <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0193"/>were
                        there taken as to the portions of the cargo condemned as contraband and its
                        value, and as to other portions of the cargo and their value belonging to
                        the owners of the contraband cargo, as to the costs of the captors
                        chargeable against the vessel, and as to the claimant’s costs chargeable
                        against the ship, and the condemned and uncondemned cargo, and these costs
                        were duly apportioned accordingly. The amount of the appraised value at
                        which the ship had been taken, less the costs charged against her, was pajd
                        over to her owners. The proceeds of the uncondemned cargo were also paid
                        over to their respective owners, less the proportion of claimant’s costs
                        against same, which costs were paid to the proctors of the respective
                        claimants, to whom they were, by the final decree, allowed. No complaint
                        appeared to have been made in the district court as to the allowance or
                        apportionment of the costs and charges, or in respect of the appraised value
                        at which the United States had taken the vessel; and no question in respect
                        of either of these matters was taken to the Supreme Court on appeal. By
                        stipulation of the counsel for the respective parties, all the papers
                        relating to the appraisal and taking of the vessel by the United States were
                        omitted from the apostles sent up to the Supreme Court on appeal.</p>
                    <p>The claimants in No. 405 claimed about £21,000, besides interest, for the
                        alleged value of the vessel, over and above the appraised value at which she
                        was taken by the United States; and for freight and passage money which they
                        would have been entitled to receive, and costs and expenses sustained by
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The claimants in Nos. 408, 409, and 411 claimed about £6,000, besides
                        interest, the alleged value of their portions of the cargo condemned,
                        including prospective profits upon the sale of the same at Matamoras, and
                        their costs and expenses.</p>
                    <p>The claimants in the remaining cases claimed about £40,000, besides interest,
                        for the alleged value of their portions of the cargo, including prospective
                        profits on its sale at Matamoras, and their costs and expenses respectively,
                        less the respective amounts received by them from the proceeds of the
                        cargo.</p>
                    <p>The proofs showed that the Peterhoff sailed from London for the mouth of the
                        Rio Grande in January, 1863, the bills of lading of her cargo specifying the
                        same as destined for Matamoras, and to be taken from alongside the ship at
                        the mouth of the Rio Grande. Included in the cargo were some thirty-two
                        cases of artillery harness, a large quantity of boots, described in the
                        invoices as “artillery boots,” “men’s army bluchers,” &amp;c.; and eighty
                        bales of blankets described in the invoice as “government regulation gray
                        blankets.” Besides these portions, which were held by the Supreme Court as
                        belonging to the class of articles “manufactured and primarily and
                        ordinarily used for military purposes in time of war,” and so contraband
                        when destined to the use of a belligerent; the cargo included large
                        quantities of iron, steel, nails, leather, and drugs, including 1,000 pounds
                        of calomel, large amounts of morphine, 265 <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138"
                            facs="0194"/>pounds of chloroform, and 2,640 ounces of quinine, all
                        goods in special demand for the use of the confederacy. Much of the cargo
                        was deliverable to order. A package deposited with the captain by Mohl, one
                        of the Texan passengers, and which the captain testified he was told by Mohl
                        contained “white powder,” but which the mate testified appeared to be a
                        package of “dispatches,” was thrown overboard by order of the captain on the
                        boarding of the vessel by the captors. Other papers were at the same time
                        burned by the fireman by order of the captain. The firm of James I. Bennett
                        &amp; Wake, London, were the agents of, the Peterhoff, and the cargo was
                        mainly secured through them. A circular of this firm was proved, dated 24th
                        November, 1862, in which they notified their “friends desirous of shipping
                        to America” that they would dispatch a vessel to the Bio Grande about 1st
                        December; that the services of Mr. Redgate, Lloyd's agent, an expert in
                        cotton, and who had been a resident nearly forty years in Texas and Mexico,
                        had been secured, whose services would “be of great value to shippers in
                        respect to his local knowledge and influence, as also as regards agency of
                        the inland transit and landing and shipping of goods and cotton.” And
                        further, that "a Mr. Besbie, of the Confederate States of America, holds a
                        contract with that Government, whereby he is to receive 100 per cent, on
                        invoice cost, payable in cotton * * * for any goods he may deliver into the
                        Confederate States,” the benefits of which contract he would share to the
                        extent of 50 per cent, with any houses that might feel inclined to ship. The
                        Mr. Redgate named in this circular was a passenger on the Peterhoff at the
                        time of her capture, and was a claimant for part of the cargo and for
                        damages by occasion of his capture and detention before the commission. The
                        Mr. Besbie, or Begbie, also named in the circular, joined the ship at
                        Plymouth, but suddenly left it at Falmouth. His name was not mentioned by
                        the master in his deposition <hi rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi>, who
                        alluded to him merely as “another passenger" who “left at Falmouth.” Neither
                        of the firm of Bennett &amp; Wake was examined as a witness by the claimants
                        before the commission, though notice was given of the examination of
                        Bennett, and proof was made that he was within reach in London at the time
                        of the taking of the testimony for the claimants there, and the counsel
                        appearing for the United States on the examination demanded his production
                        as a witness for the claimants pursuant to the notice. Bennett &amp; Wake
                        had contracted on the 27th October, 1862, with Pile, Spence &amp;. Co., the
                        owners of the Peterhoff, for the laying on of a first-class screw-steamer to
                        proceed to the Bio Grande on freight; under which contract the Peterhoff was
                        dispatched, as named in the circular of Bennett &amp; Wake of 24th November,
                        1862, above referred to.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the United States referred to and adopted the opinion of the
                        Supreme Court, (5 Wall., 28,) as part of his argument. He maintained that
                        the proofs before the prize court, especially strengthened as they were by
                        the proofs taken before the commission, fully sustained the <pb n="139"
                            xml:id="pg_139" facs="0195"/>condemnation of the portion of the cargo
                        condemned by the Supreme Court as contraband, and in fact sufficiently
                        showed the pretended destination of the vessel and cargo to Matamoras to be
                        colorable. That if all the proofs now appearing before the commission had
                        been before the prize court, they would have fully justified the
                        condemnation of the vessel and the entire cargo. That in any event, the
                        capture of the vessel and taking her into port was justified by the presence
                        of the contraband on board, which was in fact liable to condemnation as well
                        as by the circumstances of the case, fully establishing probable cause. That
                        the evasions and falsehood of the master, Jarmin, on his examination <hi
                            rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi>, and the spoliation of papers shown,
                        of themselves debarred the claimants from any award for costs or damages.
                        That as to the taking of the vessel by the United States at an appraisement
                        below her alleged actual value, and as to the alleged errors of the district
                        court in the apportionment of claimants’ costs upon that part of the cargo
                        not condemned in captor’s costs, those were matters as to which no question
                        was raised in the prize-courts, and for which those courts afforded an ample
                        remedy if any injustice was done in respect of them to the claimants, or any
                        of them, and that the claimants could not be heard here for the first time
                        to question the legality of the proceedings in those respects. That as to
                        the apportionment of the claimants’ costs, this appeared to have been done
                        not only without objection of the claimants in the prize court, but on the
                        application of their own proctors and counsel. And as to the appraisement
                        and taking by the United States, everything in relation to these matters had
                        been by stipulation withdrawn from the consideration of the Supreme Court,
                        thus clearly implying the consent of the owners to the taking at the
                        valuation named.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimants, it was contended that the portions of the cargo
                        condemned by the decree of the Supreme Court as contraband were not in fact
                        contraband, not primarily designed for military use, and not shown to be
                        destined for the use of the enemies of the United States. That the voyage of
                        the vessel was lawful from one neutral port to another, and that her
                        capture, was wholly unjustified by any proof of intent to violate the,
                        blockade, or of unlawful conduct in any respect. That the valuation at which
                        the vessel was taken by the United States Government was much less than her
                        actual value, and that the United States were justly chargeable with at
                        least the sum of $30,000, on account of this difference in value. That the
                        apportionment of claimants’ costs upon those portions of the cargo not
                        condemned in costs was unlawful. That the question of costs had already been
                        settled by the decree of the Supreme Court 5 and that the district court in
                        charging these claimants’ costs upon those parts of the cargo exempted from
                        costs by the decree of the Supreme Court, disregarded and violated that
                        decree.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                    <p>The steamship Georgia; Edward Bates, M. P., claimant, No. 429.</p>
                    <p>The memorial of the claimant in this case recited that the Georgia <pb
                            n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0196"/>was an armed vessel of the
                        Confederate States. That she came into the port of Liverpool on or about the
                        2d May, 1864; was there disarmed and advertised for sale; and that the
                        claimant, on the 2d June, 1864, purchased her without any armament, and paid
                        for her in good faith the sum of £15,000 sterling, her full value at the
                        time of the purchase. That he immediately changed her internal arrangements
                        to fit her for use as a merchant steamer, and on the 18th July, 1864,
                        chartered her to the Portuguese government for a voyage to Lisbon, Portugal,
                        having spent a large sum of money in the alterations and fittings to adapt
                        her for carrying passengers and cargo pursuant to the terms of the
                        charter-party. That under the charter-party the vessel was laden by the
                        Portuguese government with coals for the use of the vessel, and duly cleared
                        at Liverpool on her voyage to Lisbon. That while pursuing that voyage, “in a
                        peaceable manner and in violation of no law whatsoever,” she was unlawfully
                        captured on the high seas by the United States ship of war Niagara; was
                        taken into the port of Boston, there libelled in the United States district
                        court, and condemned as lawful prize. That an appeal was taken from the
                        decree of the district court to the Supreme Court of the United States,
                        which on the hearing affirmed the decree of condemnation. The claimant
                        claimed an award for £27,654, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>To this memorial the United States demurred as setting forth no valid claim
                        against the United States; in that the memorial showed the vessel to have
                        been an armed vessel of war of the so-called Confederate States of America,
                        which were, during the whole period of the transactions set forth in the
                        memorial, at war with the United States. That she entered the neutral port
                        of Liverpool in her character as such armed vessel of war, and was there
                        purchased by the claimant, her armament having been first removed, with full
                        know edge of her former character as such vessel of war, belonging to a
                        power at war with the United States. That such purchase carried no title to
                        the claimant as against the United States, or as against their right to
                        capture the vessel as a vessel of war; and that her subsequent capture by
                        the United States, as set forth in the memorial, was a lawful and valid
                        capture, and the vessel was properly and lawfully condemned by the prize
                        courts.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the United States submitted the case on demurrer on the
                        opinion of the Supreme Court, delivered on the affirmance of the decree of
                        condemnation (7 Wall., 32) and without further argument.</p>
                    <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel filed an argument in behalf of the claimant,
                        in which he contended that the doctrine held by the Supreme Court, as
                        establishing liability of the vessel to capture after her disarmament and
                        sale, was unsound and unsustained by the authorities cited in the opinion.
                        He cited and discussed the authorities cited by the Supreme Court in its
                        opinion, to wit: The Minerva, 6 Rob., 397; the Baltic, 11 Moon’s P. C. R.,
                        145; Story’s notes on the Principles and Practice of Prize courts, 63;
                        Wildman, vol. 2, p. 90; and contended that these authorities <pb n="141"
                            xml:id="pg_141" facs="0197"/>did not sustain the conclusions of the
                        Supreme Court on which the decree of affirmance was based.</p>
                    <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>The steamship Circassian; Henry James Barker, mortgagee, No. 432, claimant
                        for vessel; Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., mortgagees, claimants for freight;
                        The Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and others, No. 444, claimants for
                        cargo.</p>
                    <p>The Circassian was owned by Zachariah C. Pearson, of Hull, who had given
                        mortgages to the amount of £25,000 upon the vessel, which mortgages were
                        held by the claimant Barker, No. 432. He had also assigned her outward
                        freight to Messrs. Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., No. 433, by way of security
                        for indebtedness. The vessel sailed from Bordeaux, France, on the 7th April,
                        1862, under the charter-party hereinafter recited. She was captured by a
                        United States cruiser on the 4th May, 1862, on the high seas off the coast
                        of Cuba, taken into the port of Key West, and there libelled and condemned
                        as prize. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which court affirmed the
                        decree of condemnation, Mr. Justice Nelson dissenting. The case is reported,
                        with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson, in 2 Wallace, 135 to
                        160.</p>
                    <p>The vessel was chartered by the owners 11th February, 1862, to “J. Soubry,
                        agent to the merchants of Paris,” being then on her way from London to
                        Cardiff, to proceed thence with all convenient speed to Havre or Bordeaux,
                        there to load; “and being so loaded, shall therewith proceed to Havana,
                        Nassau, or Bermuda, as ordered on sailing, and thence to proceed to a port
                        of America, and to run the blockade, if so ordered by freighters,” the
                        owners agreeing “not to cover more than half her value, say £20,000, by
                        insurance against war risk.” The rate of freight agreed upon was $40 per
                        ton, with 10 per cent, primage. The vessel was loaded at Bordeaux, shipping
                        receipts being given by the master in the following tenor, (after specifying
                        the merchandise shipped:) “Which said merchandise I promise to convey in my
                        said steamer (the dangers of the seas, machinery, and all other unavoidable

                    <p>Other papers were destroyed by the master of the Circassian after she had
                        been stopped, and before she was boarded by the captors. The vessel was
                        captured, as above stated, on the 4th May, 1862. Five days previous to the
                        capture—on the 29th April, 1862—the city of New Orleans was captured by the
                        Navy and Army of the United States, under Admiral Farragut and General
                        Butler, and thenceforward continued in the possession of the United States
                        to the termination of the war. A proclamation was issued by General Butler,
                        dated 1st May, printed by some Federal soldiers in a printing-office seized
                        for that purpose, on the 2d May, and first generally published in the
                        newspapers of the city on the 6th May; which proclamation declared, among
                        other things, that “the city of New Orleans and its environs, with all its
                        interior and exterior defences, having been surrendered to the combined
                        naval and land forces of the United States; and having been evacuated by the
                        rebel forces, in whose occupation they lately were; and being now in
                        occupation of the forces of the United States, who have come to restore
                        order, maintain public tranquility, and enforce peace and quiet under the
                        laws and Constitution of the United States, the major-general hereby makes
                        known and proclaims the objects and purpose of the Government of the United
                        States in thus taking possession of the city of New Orleans and the State of
                        Louisiana. * * * * All rights, of property of whatever kind will be held

                        proclamation also declared the city under martial law.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the Venice, (2 Wall., 276,) the Supreme Court of the United
                        States held that the military occupation of the city was to be considered as
                        substantially complete from the date of this publication in the newspapers,
                        (6th May.)</p>
                    <p>On the 12th May, President Lincoln issued a proclamation reciting the
                        blockade, up to that time, of the port of New Orleans, with two other ports,
                        and that the blockade of those ports may now be safely relaxed with
                        advantage to the interests of commerce,” and declaring that the blockade of
                        those ports “shall so far cease and determine from and after the 1st day of
                        June next; that commercial intercourse with those ports, except as to

                    <p>Barker, as mortgagee of the vessel, (No. 432,) claimed £23,200, besides
                        interest. Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., assignees of the outward freight, (No.
                        433,) claimed £10,000, besides interest. The insurance companies and
                        underwriters (No. 444) claimed £52,636, besides interest, the value of the
                        cargo insured by them, abandoned by the owners, and paid for as for a total
                        loss. Of the cargo thus insured, portions to the value of £11,503 were
                        alleged to have been owned by British subjects and insured by the claimants,
                        British underwriters. The remainder of the cargo, valued at £41,133, was
                        admitted to have been owned by French merchants residing at Bordeaux, though
                        insured by British underwriters. On the sale under the decree of
                        condemnation the gross proceeds of the vessel were $107,000, United States
                        currency; the gross proceeds of the cargo were $243,479.49 in the same

                                beyond Havana was an open question, not to be decided until her
                                arrival there; so that her capture before reaching Havana could not

                                July, 1861, (12 Stat. at L., 258, 257,) was not only entirely
                                distinct from, but inconsistent with the belligerent right of
                                blockade, and that the former right accrued when the latter
                                terminated, upon the capture and complete possession of the city;
                                and that, under the municipal regulations instituted, or to be
                                instituted, in such case, plainly no capture could be made on the
                                high seas, those municipal regulations not operating
                                extra-territorially; that the blockade having thus terminated by the
                                capture of New Orleans, the right of capture of the Circassian, if
                                it had existed until then, necessarily terminated with the

                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the voyage of the
                        Circassian was plainly undertaken with the purpose and intent of violating
                        the blockade; that she was under express contract with her freighters to
                        violate it, and was in the actual prosecution of the voyage with that
                        purpose and destination when captured, and was thereby liable to capture and
                        condemnation. (The Columbia, 1 Rob., 156.) That having full knowledge of the
                        existence of the blockade, and having expressly undertaken its violation, no
                        further notice or warning was necessary to justify her capture.</p>
                    <p>That New Orleans, which had been fully and completely an enemy’s city, and
                        one of the enemy’s chief marts from the outbreak of the rebellion in 1861 to
                        its occupation by the Army and Navy of the United States on the 29th April,
                        1862—five days before the capture of the Circassian— had not been reduced to
                        the fixed, stable, and assured possession of the United States at the time
                        of that capture. That the mere <hi rend="italic">possessio pedis</hi> of the
                        city by the United States did not work the instant termination <pb n="146"
                            xml:id="pg_146" facs="0202"/>of the blockade, but that reasonable time
                        after the actual possession must be allowed to determine whether the
                        occupation was such a stable and permanent one as to justify the opening of
                        the port as a port of the United States; That until such occupation was so
                        established, New Orleans still remained an enemy’s city as regarded the
                        rights of neutrals to trade there.</p>
                    <p>That time must be given after the actual occupation, reasonably sufficient to
                        put in force the municipal regulations of the United States, with the
                        apparatus of custom-houses and courts, through which such municipal
                        regulations were to be enforced; and that until sufficient time had elapsed
                        for that purpose, the belligerent right of blockade continued; that the
                        blockade of New Orleans was not a blockade “by the simple fact only,” but
                        “by a notification accompanied with the fact;” and such blockade continued
                        within reasonable limitation till ended by like public notification. (The
                        Neptune, 1 Rob., 170.)</p>
                    <p>That the time fixed by the Supreme Court in the case of the Venice (2 Wall.,
                        259) as the date of the assured possession by the United States, as
                        determining the national character of the inhabitants of that city, (6th
                        May, 1862,) was certainly the earliest date which could properly be assigned
                        as that of assured possession by the United States for any purpose.</p>
                    <p>That, in fact, the time necessary to establish the permanence and stability
                        of possession, by the capturing belligerent, should fairly and properly be
                        left, within reasonable limits, to his own determination, and that the date
                        of 1st June, 1862, fixed by the President of the United States by his
                        proclamation of 12th May, (12 Stat, at L., 1263, 1264,) for the termination
                        of the blockade, was within reasonable limits under the rules of
                        international law; and that that date (1st June) should be considered the
                        lawful and proper termination of the blockade.</p>
                    <p>That, at the date of the capture of the Circassian, the city of New Orleans,
                        though in the actual occupancy of the United States forces, had neither
                        capitulated nor surrendered, but was still an enemy’s city, deserted for the
                        time by its garrison, but held only by an insignificant force, and what its
                        chief civic officer, still avowing the adherence of the city to the
                        confederate cause, called "the power of brutal-force, not by choice or
                        consent of its inhabitants.” (See letter of the mayor of New Orleans to
                        Flag-officer Farragut, 4 Reb. Rec, doc. 523, 524; also, 2d Wallace, 141 <hi
                            rend="italic">n;</hi> and Barton’s Butler in New Orleans, 282, 342.)
                        That the military occupation of the city of New Orleans by the United States
                        could not be extended by construction beyond the lines of actual military
                        occupation, and that the city of New Orleans was not conterminous with the
                        port of New Orleans as established by the statutes of the United States, (9
                        Stat, at L. 458;) but that the port which had been blockaded embraced
                        territory outside the city, and not within the lines of actual military
                        occupation. That such occupation of a portion only <pb n="147"
                            xml:id="pg_147" facs="0203"/>of the port could not be deemed, of itself,
                        a termination of the blockade of the port.</p>
                    <p>That the collection district of which New Orleans was the sole port of entry,
                        included the entire extent of the navigation of the Mississippi River and
                        its tributaries, covering thousands of miles of navigation, and large cities
                        situated upon that river and its tributaries, (2 Stat. at L., 252; 4 <hi
                            rend="italic">id.</hi>, 480.) That a large extent of the country
                        included within this district, and many important ports and towns within it,
                        were still in the undisturbed control and occupancy of the enemy. That the
                        blockade of New Orleans was in effect the blockade of the Mississippi River,
                        and that until the United States were in Complete and assured possession of
                        all the mouths of the river as well as the entire port of New Orleans, the
                        imperfect and perhaps transient occupation of the city of New Orleans was
                        not to be taken as terminating the blockade.</p>
                    <p>That so far as the Circassian herself and her officers were concerned,
                        sailing with the direct purpose and destination of violating the blockade,
                        and without knowledge or notice either to them or their captors of any
                        change of occupation of New Orleans, such an accidental, technical, and
                        artificial objection to the rightfulness of her capture should not be
                        allowed to change the character of a capture otherwise lawful, and convert
                        it into an unlawful capture, without strict and conclusive proof of the
                        facts relied on so to change the character of the capture.</p>
                    <p>That, as to the claim of the insurance companies, (No. 444,) they had no
                        standing before the commission in respect of the larger part of the cargo
                        insured by them, the same having been the property of French merchants, not
                        subjects of Her Britannic Majesty. That, by the terms of the treaty,
                        jurisdiction is given to the commission only of claims “growing out of
                        injuries to the persons and property of British subjects.”</p>
                    <p>That the gist of the injury here complained of was the wrongful capture of
                        the Circassian and her cargo, the subsequent condemnation and sale being
                        merely incidents of the capture in the course of the adjudication by the
                        tribunals of the United States, as to its lawfulness, merely for the purpose
                        of determining whether the capture should be ultimately adopted as the act
                        of the United States. That, when captured, this part of the cargo was not
                        the property of the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty. That the abandonment
                        by the insured to the insurers after capture, the acceptance of such
                        abandonment by the insurers, and payment as for a total loss, simply
                        operated as a transfer to the insurers of the rights of the assured in
                        respect of the capture; and that the insurers stood merely as subrogated to
                        the rights of the owners at the time of the capture, and as their equitable
                        assignees. That such transfer by operation of law gave to the insurers as
                        equitable assignees no better standing before the commission than they would
                        have in case of a claim for any other injuries to the persons or property of
                        individuals not subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, but who had assigned
                        their claim against the United States’ for such injuries to a British
                        subject. That so far, therefore, <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0204"/>as
                        the property of these “French merchants” on board the Circassian was
                        concerned, no right of reclamation against the United States under the
                        treaty existed in the claimants.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made awards in favor of
                        all the claimants. To the claimants in No. 432, the sum of $71,428, in No.
                        433, the sum of $20,450, and in 444 the sum of $133,296. I am advised that
                        these respective sums in Nos. 432 and 444 were taken by the commission as
                        the actual proceeds of the sales of the vessel and cargo, respectively,
                        reduced from United States currency at its value at the date of sale to a
                        gold basis, and without the allowance of any interest. The award in No. 444
                        covered as well the proceeds of the cargo belonging to the French merchants
                        as the portions owned by British subjects.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read a dissenting opinion, which will be found in the
                        Appendix N.</p>
                    <p>The schooner Jane Campbell; George Campbell, claimant, No. 453.</p>
                    <p>This vessel was captured by a vessel of the United States blockading squadron
                        in December, 1861, off the port of Beaufort, N. C. She was taken into the
                        port of New York and there libelled in the United States district court.
                        That court made a decree awarding restitution of the vessel and certifying
                        probable cause of capture, but finding upon the evidence that the captors
                        had been guilty of unjustifiable conduct toward the crew and cargo and
                        stores of the vessel in the matters hereinafter named, ordered a reference
                        to prize commissioners to ascertain and report to the court the damages
                        sustained in consequence of such alleged misconduct. (The case is reported
                        in Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 107, 130.) Under this order no proofs were
                        offered by the claimants in the district court, nor any further proceedings
                        had as to such alleged damages; and no appeal was taken from the decree of
                        the district court.</p>
                    <p>The proofs in the prize court were not put in evidence before the commission,
                        but the claimant rested the case here on his own deposition taken before the
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>From the testimony of the claimant himself, it appeared that he was, down to
                        August, 1861, a resident of Petersburgh, Va.; that the vessel was of
                        American build and register, and was bought by him in July, 1861, in
                        Washington, N.C., a blockaded port of the enemy. He bought her for the
                        alleged purpose of taking his family from North Carolina to Liverpool; and
                        in August, 1861, took her out through the blockade, and subsequently caused
                        her to be registered as a British vessel. The district court found, upon the
                        proofs before it, that the vessel when captured was apparently approaching
                        the blockaded port of Beaufort, N. C., with intention to enter it. The
                        claimant alleged in his memorial, and stated in his deposition, that he was
                        on a voyage from Liverpool to Havana; that he was compelled by stress of
                        weather and injuries received to seek <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149"
                            facs="0205"/>assistance off the coast of North Carolina, and approached
                        the blockading fleet for that purpose, making known his condition, but his
                        vessel was thereupon seized and sent in for libel. The memorial also
                        alleged, and the prize court found upon the evidence before it, that on the
                        capture of the vessel the claimant, who’ was on board of her, was, with some
                        of the ship’s company, taken from the schooner, placed on board a United
                        States vessel, and carried to Fortress Monroe and there landed, while the
                        vessel, with her captain and the remainder of her cargo, was taken to New
                        York, and that the prize crew, while on board, broke open the hatches and
                        the store-room and appropriated portions of the cargo and stores. The
                        memorial claimed damages for the detention of the vessel and the injuries to
                        the cargo and stores, £3,260, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>The claimant assigned in his memorial, and in his deposition, as the reason
                        of his omission to make proof of his damages in the district court, and to
                        appeal to the Supreme Court, that he was informed by the assistant district
                        attorney of the United States that if he persisted in the prosecution of his
                        claim for damages, the United States would appeal from the judgment of
                        restitution rendered by the district court; and that knowing that this
                        course would probably keep his property locked up for years, and not being
                        in a position to bear such a loss, he took away the vessel and cargo without
                        any further prosecution of his claim for damages.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the purchase of the
                        vessel by the claimant within a blockaded port of the enemy, she being at
                        the time an enemy’s vessel, and the claimant at the time of the purchase an
                        enemy by domicile, and the subsequent taking her out through the blockade,
                        followed by change of domicile of the owner and of registry of the vessel,
                        did not change the character of the vessel from an enemy to a neutral. That
                        the purchase of a private merchant-ship of the enemy by a neutral in time of
                        war, when made in a neutral port, if not <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>
                        illegal, is always liable to great suspicion, and demands proof of good
                        faith and of payment of full consideration. (3 Phill., 607.) That such sale
                        when made in a blockaded port of the enemy was absolutely void; and that if
                        the facts of this pretended sale had been made to appear in the prize court,
                        the vessel must there have been condemned as enemy’s property. That the
                        claimant had full opportunity to make proof and receive an award for his
                        alleged damages in the prize court; and that having voluntarily abandoned
                        the pursuit of his remedy there, he could not now be heard to make
                        reclamation before the commission. That the reason alleged by him for his
                        omission to prosecute his claim for damages in the prize court, made his
                        case no better. That the law-officer of the United States had an undisputed
                        right to say to the claimant, as he did in effect: "If you choose to claim
                        damages of the United States I shall take an appeal and test the question of
                        the right of condemnation in the appellate court; but if you are willing to
                        take the vessel without claim of damages I will waive my <pb n="150"
                            xml:id="pg_150" facs="0206"/>right of appeal, and allow yon to depart
                        with the vessel and cargo.” That the claimant’s abandonment of the right
                        thus given him to make proof in regard to the misconduct of the captors
                        rather than have the question of condemnation reviewed on appeal, was
                        clearly “an acknowledgment of the justice of the sentence.” That by the
                        claimant’s omission to produce before this commission the testimony taken in
                        the prize court, he was debarred from alleging that the evidence in that
                        court was insufficient to sustain the decree certifying probable cause of
                        capture.</p>

                        to New York, where it was alleged that she disposed of the cargo of coal at
                        a rate much less than it would have commanded in Savannah, and took a
                        homeward freight from New York of much less value than she would have
                        secured from Savannah. In fact, at the date of the warning no sufficient
                        blockade had been instituted at Savannah or at any other port south of
                        Charleston; the actual blockade of Savannah not having commenced until the

                        salt, under written instructions to proceed to Charleston and deliver vessel
                        and cargo to consignees there; and if that port should be found blockaded,
                        then to go to Savannah; and if he failed in getting a cotton freight at
                        either Charleston or Savannah, then to go to St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and
                        load with a cargo of deals for the return voyage. On the 12th May she

                    <p>The Hilja (No. 467) sailed from Liverpool on the 25th March, 1861, in
                        ballast, for Charleston; the memorial alleging that she intended to load, on
                        freight at that port or at Savannah, a return cargo of cotton for Liverpool.
                        She was boarded by an officer of the United States steamship Niagara off
                        Charleston Harbor, on the 12th May, and a warning entered upon her register,
                        substantially the same as in the case of the Monmouth. The memorial alleged
                        that the captain of the Hilja, having an alternative destination to
                        Savannah, was debarred from proceeding to that port by this warning; that
                        she thereupon proceeded to Pugwash, but gave no information as to her
                        earnings by her return freight. Damages were claimed to the amount of £6,101
                            3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., besides

                    <p>The sailing orders of the Hilja were not put in evidence nor accounted for,
                        though it appeared that she sailed under written orders; nor was any
                        evidence adduced as to her alternative destination to Savannah, except that
                        of the claimant himself, examined on notice, who, after many evasive and
                        contradictory answers on cross-examination as to the destination of the
                        vessel, finally summed up his evidence in this regard by saying: “I think I
                        mentioned to him verbally that if freights were better at Savannah he was to
                        go there.” The claimant also testified that he had, through Mr. A. E. Byrne,
                        (claimant in No. 315,) had correspondence with the British foreign office in
                        respect to this warning, off of his vessel, and that he had had like
                        correspondence with Her Majesty’s consul at Charleston, through Messrs.
                        Robert Muir &amp; Co., and that there had also been correspondence between
                        Muir &amp; Co. and himself, and between Henderson, the master of the vessel,
                        (since dead,) and himself; but none of this correspondence was either
                        produced or accounted for. No proof was made as to the avails of the return
                        freight from Pugwash, except the general statement of the claimant in his
                        deposition that “the whole voyage brought in a loss;” and on
                        cross-examination the claimant, when questioned as to his transactions in
                        connection with violating the blockade during the war, and furnishing <pb
                            n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0208"/>aid to the confederate government,
                        declined to answer all” such questions.</p>
                    <p>It appeared that an actual blockade of the port of Charleston was established
                        by the presence of a sufficient blockading force, at the dates of the
                        respective warnings of the three vessels.</p>
                    <p>The three cases were argued and submitted together.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States, it was contended that the warning entered
                        upon the register of these vessels, respectively, so far as applicable to
                        any unblockaded ports, was without authority of the United States, a clear
                        error on the part of the officer giving the warning, insufficient to
                        preclude the further voyage of the vessels warned to any unblockaded port,
                        and had never been adopted or ratified by the United States; that the case
                        rested on the voluntary abandonment, by the masters of the Monmouth and the
                        Boyne, respectively, of their alternative voyage to Savannah, upon an
                        incorrect warning, unduly given by an unauthorized officer of the United
                        States, and that for such loss no reclamation lay against the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the Hilja, it was maintained on the part of the United States
                        that the proof showed no alternative destination to Savannah; that the
                        vessel was merely stopped from entering the blockaded port of Charleston, to
                        which she was destined, and that no loss whatever was shown to have accrued
                        to her, except that caused by her being prevented from entering that port,
                        and that no proof was made of actual loss even in this respect; that the
                        non-production, by the claimant Wilson, of the correspondence with the
                        British foreign office, and with the British consul at Charleston, as well
                        as his own correspondence with his captain, Henderson, and his agents at
                        Charleston, Muir &amp; Co., sufficiently indicated that the claimant then
                        put his claim for compensation solely on the ground of the illegality or
                        insufficiency of the blockade of Charleston, and that the pretended
                        alternative destination to Savannah was an afterthought, borrowed from the
                        cases of the Monmouth and the Boyne; that his own testimony, on which he
                        rested the case, was upon its face unworthy of credit.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the United States also claimed that in the case of an award
                        of damages in any of these cases, the anticipated earnings by freights from
                        Savannah, at high rates, could not be taken into account as elements of the
                        award. That such anticipated earnings were speculative and illusory; that
                        the evidence showed that the market at Savannah, in respect both of sales of
                        the outward cargoes, and of the rate of freights, was exceedingly irregular
                        and violent in its fluctuations, and in effect a gaming market. That it
                        could not be assumed that the vessels could have secured return cargoes at
                        Savannah in season to leave within the time limited after the establishment
                        of the blockade there; nor that they could have secured such rates of
                        freight as were claimed in the respective cases; and that these claims were
                        of substantially the same nature of speculative and uncertain prospective
                        profits, which <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0209"/>were rejected by the
                        tribunal at Geneva, in the case of the claims for anticipated earnings and
                        profits of captured vessels, claimed before that tribunal.</p>

                        guardian, alleged that he was born in Charleston, S. C, his father being at
                        the time of his birth a British subject and resident at Charleston, as Her
                        Britannic Majesty’s vice-consul for that port and for the State of South

                        a party to the bill, and placed the moneys belonging to the claimant under
                        the will in the receivership and under the control of the court; and that,
                        under the protection of the court, the moneys so belonging to the claimant
                        were invested in bonds of the Confederate States during the war. That “by
                        reason of such investment for the purposes of carrying on civil war, and by
                        reason of such civil war and rebellion, and by the act of the Government of
                        the United States in suppressing the said rebellion and restoring the
                        authority of the Federal Government,” the claimant’s moneys were totally and
                        irrecoverably lost. That the court in question was a tribunal of competent
                        power and jurisdiction to direct the investment and charge of such moneys;
                        and that “the civil war, through the act of the Government of the United
                        States, destroyed the investments.” The claimant claimed an award for
                        $20,000, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>A demurrer was interposed on the part of the United States to the memorial,
                        specifying, among other grounds, that the claimant was, by the laws of the
                        United States, a citizen of the United States, and so could have no standing
                        as a British subject under the treaty; that the alleged wrongs were
                        perpetrated, if at all, by the pretended courts and authorities of the
                        so-called State of South Carolina, while not acting under or by the
                        authority of the Constitution, laws, or Government of <pb n="154"
                            xml:id="pg_154" facs="0210"/>the United States, but while in rebellion
                        against the United States and at war with them, and that for such acts the
                        United States were not liable; that the claimant alleged that the court of
                        South Carolina was a court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of
                        the person of the claimant, and exercising such jurisdiction; and that the
                        claimant, by his guardian, voluntarily submitted himself to such
                        jurisdiction; that he did not allege the order or decree of the court to
                        have been fraudulently made, or its treatment of the claimant’s property to
                        have been exceptional; and that for such action of a judicial tribunal,
                        however erroneous; no claim could lie under the treaty. That the allegation
                        that the civil war, through the act of the Government of the United States,
                        “destroyed the investments of the claimant,” formed no ground of claim
                        against the United States.</p>
                    <p>The case was submitted without argument, and the claim was unanimously
                        disallowed.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Edward Alfred Barrett <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United
                        States, No. 18, the claimant, resident in England during the war, alleged
                        that in October, 1864, he purchased for a valuable consideration and was
                        still the possessor and absolute owner of a certain “cotton loan bond” of
                        the Confederate States of America, by which the Confederate States bound
                        themselves to pay to the bearer £200 sterling, with interest at 7 per cent,
                        per annum, semi-annually, on the 1st day of March and the 1st day of
                        September in each year, until redemption of the principal at par. That the
                        Government of the United States, in the year 1865, “seized all the public
                        assets of the said Confederate States and especially a very large quantity
                        of cotton, hypothecated by the said Confederate States government for
                        payment of the said cotton loan, and thus prevented those States from paying
                        their cotton-loan bondholders.” That in consequence of such seizure by the
                        Government of the United States, the principal of said bond remained unpaid,
                        and no interest had been paid thereon from the 1st day of March, 1865. The
                        claimant claimed damages £200 besides interest.</p>
                    <p>The memorial came to the hands of the agent of the United States on the 14th
                        November, 1871. Though insignificant in amount, it involved a principal of
                        the highest importance; and it was understood that it was presented as one
                        of a large number of claims of the same character already in the hands of
                        Her Majesty’s agent, and involving claims against the United States on
                        account of debts of the late so-called Confederate States to very large
                        amounts. The agent of the United States, believing the claim to be neither
                        within the letter or spirit of the treaty, and to be one which ought not to
                        have been presented by Her Majesty’s government to the commission,
                        immediately sent to the Secretary of State of the United States a copy of
                        the memorial, with the following letter: <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155"

                                the Washington commission under the British treaty.</p>
                            <p>You will notice that it is based solely on an alleged liability of
                                the United States for payment of the cotton loan (so-called) of the
                                late Confederate States, (so called.) It is the first claim of this
                                character which has been presented to the commission.</p>
                            <p>Believing such claims to be entirely outside the submission made by
                                the twelfth article of the treaty, and that the Government of the
                                United States never has consented to submit to arbitration any
                                question of their liability for debts of this character, and that it
                                is not within my province to discuss or consent to the discussion of
                                the question of such liability before the commission, I beg to
                                submit the case to you for specific instruction.</p>
                            <p>The questions involved seem to pertain more directly to the
                                diplomatic relations of the two countries than to any mere question
                                of legal practice or construction.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                    <p>I am advised that the Government of the United States thereupon immediately,
                        through Mr. Schenck, the minister of the United States at the court of St.
                        James, protested against the presentation of such a claim as not within the
                        terms of submission by the treaty, and requested of the British government
                        that the claim be withdrawn. This request not having been complied with, the
                        agent of the United States, under specific instructions from the Secretary
                        of State on the 9th December, 1871, filed with the commission a motion to
                        dismiss the memorial for want of jurisdiction, as stating no case for a
                        claim against the United States within the intent of the treaty. On this
                        motion the agent of the United States, on the 13th December, 1871, submitted
                        a printed argument, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>By the twelfth article of the treaty the claims against the United
                                States submitted to the adjudication of the commission are those of
                                subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, “arising out of acts committed
                                against the persons or property of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty
                                “during the time limited by that article.</p>
                            <p>This language is plain and unambiguous. It limits the claims to those
                                technically known as “torts," and those “torts" committed against
                                the “persons or property-” of the claimants.</p>
                            <p>It could not be contended that the claims so submitted would include
                                a claim on contract against the United States, though founded
                                directly on a contract duly executed by an authorized officer of
                                that Government, and plainly violated by that Government.</p>
                            <p>Much less can it be held to include a contract executed by and in the
                                name of an <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0212"/>insurrectionary
                                organization, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the
                                United States, seeking the subversion of that Government, levying
                                war upon it, and finally suppressed by its power.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the specious attempt to disguise the true nature of
                                this claim under an allegation of the destruction by the United
                                States, in war, of property “hypothecated” by the so-called
                                Confederate States for the security of their debts, it is really
                                neither more nor less than a claim to hold the United States liable
                                for the debts of those lately in rebellion against them, contracted
                                in the very course of such rebellion, in aid of it, and from which
                                it drew its chief support.</p>
                            <p>To believe for a moment that the United States ever intended to
                                submit such a question to arbitration would be, at the same time, to
                                do violence to the language of the treaty, and to falsify the
                                history of that Government by imputing to it a pusillanimity wholly
                                unwarranted by anything in its past career or present condition. It
                                would be to believe that the United States have deliberately
                                signified their willingness, at the award of this commission, to pay
                                debts contracted by their defeated enemies, for the sole purpose of
                                the dismemberment of their Government and the destruction of their
                                liberties; debts held in the deepest abhorrence by the unanimous
                                sentiment of their loyal people, and debts, the assumption or
                                payment of which, in any form, by the United States, or anyone of
                                their constituent States, has been prohibited by solemn
                                constitutional enactment, by that fundamental law to which all
                                treaties, as well as all statutes; are subject.</p>
                            <p>When the Government and people of the United States shall acknowledge
                                that in their recent successful struggle with rebellion they were
                                wholly in the wrong, and the rebels wholly in the right; when they
                                shall determine to compensate the rebels themselves for <hi
                                    rend="italic">their</hi> losses in person and property by the
                                war, to pension <hi rend="italic">their</hi> widows and orphans, and
                                to repudiate the debt of the Federal Government contracted for the
                                    <hi rend="italic">suppression</hi> of the rebellion; then, and
                                not till then, will they consider the question of paying the
                                mercenary foreign subscribers to the rebel loans, more criminal in
                                their eyes, or at least sharing more of their abhorrence, than any
                                other participants in the gigantic crime.</p>
                            <p>The language of the treaty itself is believed to be abundantly
                                specific in excluding claims of the character of that in question.
                                If any ambiguity could be found in that language, it would be fully
                                removed by reference to the protocols of conference of the Joint
                                High Commissioners, and to facts of universal cognizance in
                                connection with them.</p>
                            <p>By the 36th protocol, under the head of “Articles XII to XVII,” it
                                appears that the American commissioners, when invited by their
                                British colleagues to include within the terms of the treaty another
                                class of claims by Her Majesty’s subjects against the United States,
                                declined so to do, saying, “That, in their view, the subject was not
                                embraced in the scope of the correspondence between Sir Edward
                                Thornton and Mr. Fish under either of the letters of the former; and
                                that they did not feel justified in entering upon the consideration
                                of any class of claims not contemplated at the time of the creation
                                of the present commission," &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the correspondence between Sir Edward Thornton and Mr.
                                Fish, named in the protocol, it will be found that the first mention
                                of or reference to the claims covered by the twelfth article, is
                                contained in the letter of Sir Edward to Mr. Fish, under the date of
                                February 1, 1871, and that in that letter he designates them as
                                claims “arising out of acts committed,” &amp;c, the same language
                                which was subsequently copied into the treaty, and, with the
                                addition, by way of giving greater point and accuracy, of the
                                further words, “against the persons or property of subjects of Her
                                Britannic Majesty.”</p>
                            <p>It must be borne in mind that at the time of this correspondence, as
                                well as at the time of the conclusion and ratification of the
                                treaty, the Constitution of the United States contained an express
                                prohibition of the assumption or payment of these debts by the
                                United States or by any State. That every officer of the United
                                States, executive, <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0213"
                                />legislative, and judicial, was thus bound by the supreme law of
                                the land and by his oath of office to treat as utterly null any
                                provision of any treaty or statute in contravention of that
                                constitutional prohibition, under penalty of impeachment or its
                                equivalent. That the existence of this constitutional provision was
                                well known, not only to the Secretary of State, the Commissioners,
                                the Chief Executive, and the Senate of the United States, all
                                parties on the part of the United States to the treaty or to this
                                preliminary correspondence, but was equally well known to the
                                British minister and to the British High Commissioners. It cannot,
                                therefore, be for a moment believed that the American Secretary, in
                                his acceptance of the proposition of Sir Edward by his letter of
                                February 3—the President of the United States, in directing that
                                acceptance—the American members of the Joint High Commission in
                                negotiating and concluding the treaty—the President in ratifying, or
                                the Senate of the United States in advising and consenting to the
                                same—ever intended to embody in it a provision which should violate
                                the fundamental law of the nation, or that the ministers and
                                commissioners of Her Britanic Majesty so understood them to
                                intend.</p>
                            <p>In case, too, of any possible ambiguity, it must be borne in mind
                                that this language first emanated from Her Majesty’s minister, and
                                that by the settled rules of diplomatic as well as legal
                                construction, the party employing ambiguous language is debarred
                                from any benefit of the ambiguity.</p>
                            <p>But the United States insist that the language is not ambiguous; that
                                it is plain and explicit, and that within it a claim of this
                                character has no place among the matters submitted by the treaty to
                                this commission for its decision.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is warranted in saying that the words “arising out of
                                acts committed,” were deliberately and intentionally inserted by Sir
                                Edward in his letter of 1st February, repeated by Secretary Fish in
                                his letter of 3d February, and copied and elaborated by the Joint
                                High Commissioners in the twelfth article of the treaty, for the
                                express purpose of excluding all possible claims of the nature of
                                the debts of the States lately in rebellion, singly or under any
                                attempted and abortive organization.</p>
                            <p>If the counsel for the United States deemed himself at liberty to
                                discuss the merits of the claim here presented, as within the
                                jurisdiction of the commission to decide, the answer to the claim,
                                on its merits, would be palpable, self-suggesting, and
                                conclusive.</p>
                            <p>But he expressly disclaims all intention of such discussion, and asks
                                the dismission of the claim on the ground specified in his
                                motion.</p>

                                the payment of debts contracted by the rebel authorities.</p>
                            <p>The rebellion was a struggle against the United States for the
                                establishment in a portion of the country belonging to the United
                                States of a new state in the family of nations, and it failed.
                                Persons contracting with the so-called Confederate States
                                voluntarily assumed the risk of such failure and accepted its
                                obligations, subject to the paramount rights of the parent state by
                                force to crush the rebel organization and seize all its assets and
                                property, whether hypothecated by it or not to its creditors. Such
                                belligerent right of the United States to seize and hold was not
                                subordinate to the rights <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0214"
                                />of creditors of the rebel organization created by contract with
                                the latter; and when such seizure was actually accomplished it put
                                an end to any claim to the property which the creditor otherwise
                                might have had.</p>
                            <p>We are therefore of opinion that after such seizure the claimant had
                                no interest in the property, and the claim is dismissed.</p>

                    <p>In view of the attitude taken by the British government upon the presentation
                        of the claim for so-called indirect damages in the “Case" of the United
                        States before the tribunal of arbitration at Geneva, and of the intense
                        feeling manifested by the British nation through the press and in parliament
                        and elsewhere on that subject, I have deemed this case worthy of specific
                        and full report. The case involved in principle the question of the
                        liability of the United States for the entire debt of the late Confederate
                        States. If within the jurisdiction of the commission, if was plain that the
                        United States might, by the decision of the commission, be held liable for
                        so much of that debt as was held at the termination of the war by British
                        subjects, the amount of which is of course a matter of conjecture merely,
                        but which doubtless amounted to many hundred millions of dollars. It is
                        impossible to believe that the Government of the United States could ever
                        have designed to submit the question of such liability to arbitration; and
                        it is certain that the people of the United States would never have
                        consented to the submission in any form of such a question to arbitration,
                        or to any measures of which the possible result might be to charge them with
                        the payment of the debt of the Confederate Stated or any part of such debt.
                        It is difficult to see why the presentation of such a claim to the
                        commission, and the claim made by such presentation that the commission had
                        jurisdiction under the treaty to make an award against the United States on
                        account of this vast debt of their late enemies, the payment of which in any
                        form had been prohibited by constitutional enactment, might not naturally
                        and properly have produced among the people of the United States quite as
                        intense an excitement, and quite as earnest and vigorous demonstrations of
                        hostility to such submission as were manifested by the people of Great
                        Britain in respect of the claims for indirect damages at Geneva. It is,
                        however, worthy of note that during its pendency before the commission, the
                        fact of the presentation of such a claim was not even in the public press or
                        in Congress or in any other manner brought to popular notice, and no angry
                        demonstrations were anywhere made in relation to it.</p>
                    <p>The disposition of the case before the commission, both in substance and
                        form, seems to have been entirely satisfactory to both nations; and an
                        analogy may perhaps be noted between the manner in which the commission
                        disposed of this claim, and that subsequently adopted by <pb n="159"
                            xml:id="pg_159" facs="0215"/>the tribunal at Geneva in respect to the
                        claims for the so-called indirect damages.</p>
                    <p>In the case of William Adam, (No. 72,) the claimant, a British subject
                        domiciled in England, alleged that he was, in 1862, the owner of certain
                        bonds of a railroad company within the United States, amounting to $5,000
                        principal, with interest, payable half yearly, at six per cent, per annum,
                        the interest upon which had been regularly paid in specie up to the 31st
                        December, 1861. That in the year 1862, the Congress of the United States
                        passed a law making paper money a legal tender without any protection to
                        pre-existing contracts; and that immediately after that law the paper money
                        of the United States became depreciated in value, and the claimant was
                        thenceforward compelled to receive payment of his interest in such
                        depreciated currency, and that the bonds themselves and the prospective
                        interest to become due thereon, had likewise become depreciated in
                        consequence of the same legislation. That the Supreme Court of the United
                        States had, in 1871, adjudged the act of 1862 valid in its application to
                        pre-existing debts. He submitted with his memorial a computation of his
                        losses in the premises, and claimed’ damages $3,309, besides interest. A
                        demurrer was interposed to the memorial on behalf of the United States, on
                        the ground that it stated no case within the jurisdiction of the commission,
                        and no facts showing any liability for compensation to the claimant.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously made an award as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The commissioners are of opinion that the matters alleged in the
                                memorial do not constitute the basis of any valid claim against the
                                United States. The claim is therefore disallowed.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>In the case of Joseph W. Roach, No. 154, the claim was for the value of the
                        brigantine Madeira and her cargo, which was alleged to have been, on the 3d
                        October, 1863, run into by the Clyde, a steamer transport owned by the
                        United States, and the vessel and her cargo thereby sunk and totally lost.
                        That the collision took place in the course of a lawful voyage of the
                        Madeira from the port of Saint John’s, Porto Rico, to the port of New York;
                        and that the Clyde was then upon a voyage for the Government of the United
                        States, and under the charge of officers of that Government. That the
                        collision happened entirely through the neglect and default of the officers
                        of the Clyde. The memorial claimed damages $14,969.50, besides interest. The
                        proofs filed sustained the allegations in the memorial as to the loss of the
                        vessel and cargo by the default of the officers of the Clyde, and showed
                        that the matter had been investigated by the claims commission of the War
                        Department, and a report was made by that commission in January, 1867,
                        assessing the damages of the claimant at $11,373.98, besides interest. The
                        only question raised in the case was as to the amount of damages to be
                        allowed. The commission unanimously awarded the claimant $14,081.</p>
                    <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0216"/>
                    <p>Claim of William Scott Millar, No. 157. The memorial in this case alleged
                        that the claimant, a British subject domiciled at New Orleans, was, on the
                        25th September, 1864, the owner of 330 bales of cotton, then worth $223,253.
                        That on that day the cotton was unlawfully seized and taken from his
                        possession by a supervising special agent of the United States Treasury
                        Department, and was proceeded against for forfeiture to the United States,
                        by libel of information filed in the United States district court for the
                        district of Louisiana. That the claimant appeared in that suit, and claimed
                        restitution of the cotton, but that it was detained till December, 1864,
                        when it was surrendered to him upon the execution of a bond by him with
                        sureties to the United States, conditioned to abide the decree of the court
                        upon the libel. That between the date of the seizure and the date of the
                        release the cotton largely depreciated in value, and the claimant was also
                        compelled to pay large sums by way of costs. Damages were claimed by reason
                        of the depreciation in value and the costs paid, $90,145, besides
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>The proofs showed that the cotton in question was purchased at points within
                        the confederate military lines in the State of Mississippi, under alleged
                        permits issued by a special agent of the United States Treasury Department,
                        and was seized on its way through those military lines and into the
                        territory held by the United States forces. The district court dismissed the
                        libel for confiscation with costs. No claim for damages by reason of the
                        seizure appeared to have been interposed by the claimant in that court, and
                        no damages were there awarded him.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the decree of acquittal by
                        the district court without certificate of probable cause conclusively
                        established the seizure as wrongful. That the United States were responsible
                        for the seizure as made by an authorized agent of the Treasury Department in
                        the line of his duty and under color of acts of Congress. And that the act
                        of the agent in making the seizure had been expressly adopted by the
                        Government by instituting proceedings for the forfeiture of the property.
                        The counsel for the claimant cited Gelston <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. White,

                        United States, (3 How., 197.)</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the proofs
                        conclusively showed the purchase of the property by the claimant within the
                        enemy’s lines, and his attempted transportation of the same through those
                        lines into the Federal jurisdiction, to have been illegal and not warranted
                        by his permits; that the cotton should have been condemned by the district
                        court; that the decree of that court was not conclusive against the United
                        States upon the claim now preferred for damages, and that the commission
                        were entitled to look into the proofs and adjudicate upon the question of
                        the liability of the United States for damages as an original question; that
                        the claimant might have presented and prosecuted his claim for damages
                        against the United <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0217"/>States in the
                        district court in the action brought against him for forfeiture, and might
                        there have recovered his damages if lawfully entitled to the same and that
                        until he had exhausted his remedy before the tribunals of the United States,
                        he had no standing to make reclamation before the commission. The commission
                        unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>Amos Bigland’s claim, No. 199, was for damages for the detention of the
                        British steamship Tubal Cain, in the port of “New York, from the 8th April
                        to the 16th July, 1863, one hundred days; and damages were claimed, $38,378,
                        besides interest. The claimant was a British merchant domiciled in the city
                        of New York. He chartered the Tubal Cain to one Mora for a voyage to
                        Matamoras <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Havana and back to New York. She was
                        loaded by the charterer, and on the 8th April, being ready to sail,
                        clearance was refused by the custom-house authorities, and she was seized by
                        the United States authorities, the collector of the port and the military
                        commander of the department concurring in the seizure, on the charge that
                        she was undertaking to carry on an illicit voyage between New York and the
                        blockaded ports of Texas, and was carrying out contraband of war destined
                        for the confederacy, and was also carrying passengers engaged in contraband
                        trade with the enemy, one of them being an agent of the Confederate States
                        government engaged in the purchase of munitions of war. Mr. Edwards
                        Pierrepont, of New York, was commissioned by the War Department to examine
                        and report upon the case. On the 26th May he made his report, sustaining in
                        substance the charges named as to two passengers, Blum and Sutton, whom he
                        found having contraband goods on board intended for the Texas trade, and
                        engaged in the service of the enemy; but reported that neither the owner or
                        charterer of the vessel had knowledge that any of the goods shipped were
                        contraband of war or were intended for illegal trade. He further reported
                        that there was reasonable cause for detaining the vessel, but recommended
                        that the vessel be discharged from custody, and the goods be delivered up to
                        the owners on their application and receipt for the same. The report was
                        approved by the Solicitor of the War Department, and the vessel was
                        surrendered on the 16th July and her cargo returned to the shippers, with
                        the exception of the goods of Blum and Sutton.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the refusal to clear
                        the vessel, her detention for examination, and the unlading of her cargo for
                        that purpose, were lawful acts; that they were done under the authority of
                        the regular custom-house officials of New York, and that the fact that those
                        officials were aided by the military authorities in no respect affected the
                        character of the transaction; that the facts of the case were such as in a
                        prize court would have certainly justified the capture as one by “probable
                        cause “if the vessel had been captured on the high seas and brought into
                        port and libelled as prize; that the same <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                            facs="0218"/>principles were to be applied in the consideration of this
                        case of detention, and that no liability existed against the United States
                        on account of it.</p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously made an award in favor of the claimant for $4,800.
                        I am advised that this award was made in respect only of the detention of
                        the vessel, between the date of Mr. Pierrepont’s report and her final
                        discharge, the commission holding that detention unreasonable.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Thomas Grant, No. 211, the claimant, in addition to his claim
                        for tobacco, captured in running the blockade from Wilmington, before
                        reported, claimed $7,000 damages for the alleged breaking up of his lawful
                        business as a manufacturer of tobacco by the “terrific shelling of the city
                        of Petersburg,” by the United States forces in 1864 and 1865, “which was so
                        violent at times, during the period of ten months, that no business could be
                        regularly and successfully conducted within the city limits.” He also
                        claimed the further sum of $1,440 for his interest in a quantity of tobacco,
                        which he alleged was lost in South Carolina while in the course of
                        transportation to remove it out of the reach of the Federal Army under
                        General Sherman. It was not alleged that the loss was caused by the United
                        States forces except as the remote cause of the removal. On demurrer the
                        commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                    <p>In the case of William Cleary, No. 220, the claimant, among other claims set
                        up in his memorial, claimed $5,000 damages for an alleged violent assault,
                        wounding, and ill treatment committed upon him by a private soldier of the
                        United States Army, at Savannah, in March, 1865, by which he alleged that
                        his life was endangered and himself disabled for some months. No allegation
                        or proof was made connecting any officer of the United States, or any other
                        person except the assailant, with the alleged assault. The commission made
                        an award in favor of the claimant in respect of property taken for the use
                        of the United States, but gave nothing on account of the alleged
                        assault.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Sheldon Lewis, No. 287, the claimant alleged that, in March,
                        1863, he was the owner of the bark Matilda A. Lewis, on which vessel was
                        laden in that month a quantity of fowls destined for Havana. That the
                        officers of the United States refused to permit the vessel to leave with the
                        fowls, and took possession of them. That subsequently the consignee of the
                        fowls in Havana brought suit against the vessel in the United States
                        district court for the southern district of New York for the value of the
                        fowls, and recovered judgment for $1,100, for which amount, with the
                        additional sum of $600 costs expended by him, the claimant claimed an
                        award.</p>
                    <p>It appeared from the evidence that, by order of the Secretary of the Treasury
                        of 19th May, 1863, officers of the custom-houses of the United States were
                        directed to refuse clearances for the exportation of “horses, <pb n="163"
                            xml:id="pg_163" facs="0219"/>mules, and live-stock,” and to cause the
                        detention of all animals attempted to be so exported. That the fowls in
                        question had been shipped by one Glas upon the vessel for Havana; that the
                        customs officers in New York construed the order of the Secretary of the
                        Treasury as covering fowls, refused to grant clearance for them, and ordered
                        them to be relanded. The fowls were relanded and delivered to the shipper,
                        and the charterer of the vessel having produced to Glas one of the
                        triplicate bills of lading, Glas signed a memorandum on same, annulling the
                        bill of lading. Meantime Glas had procured from the agent of the consignees
                        at New York an advance of $700, on one of the triplicate bills of lading for
                        the fowls. This fact was not disclosed to the charterer when the bill of
                        lading was cancelled by Glas. The consignee subsequently brought suit
                        against the vessel and recovered on the ground of his advance made to Glas
                        upon the bill of lading, and that the surrender of the fowls by the
                        charterer to Glas, and the cancelling of the bill of lading by Glas did not
                        prejudice his rights, and that the order prohibiting the exportation of
                        live-stock was unlawful, and that if lawful it was not intended to include
                        fowls. (See report of the case Desvernine v. The Bark Matilda A. Lewis, 5
                        Blatchford’s C. C. R., 520 to 523.) In a like case, subsequently brought to
                        the notice of the Secretary of the Treasury, and involving the construction
                        of the order of 19th May, 1863, the Secretary held that the order did not
                        cover poultry.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the construction
                        placed by the custom-house officers upon the order of the Secretary of the
                        Treasury was evidently an unjust and forced construction; that if
                        application had been made at once to the Secretary of the Treasury, the
                        decision of the customs-officers at New York would have been overruled, and
                        that the United States were not responsible for the error of judgment of
                        such subordinate officers till proper resort was had to some responsible and
                        chief officer of the Government, whose decision upon the question might bind
                        the Government. Also, that if the United States were liable for the wrongful
                        acts of the customs-officers, the claimant was in no position to maintain
                        this claim; that the charterer of his vessel had wrongfully allowed the
                        fowls to be returned to Glas, the shipper, on his cancellation of one of the
                        bills of lading, without calling in the others, upon one of which the
                        advance of the consignees had already been made; that the owner of the
                        vessel had therefore been made liable solely by the default of his
                        charterer, by whose acts certainly the United States could not be
                        prejudiced.</p>
                    <p>The commission made an award in favor of the claimant for $1,819: Mr.
                        Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. A. E. Campbell &amp; Co., claimants in No. 290, claimed from the
                        United States $25,881, besides interest, the alleged value of a cargo of
                        sugar on board the brig John Welch, which brig was alleged to have been
                        captured by the privateer Jeff. Davis, and carried into Charleston, S. C,
                        where her cargo was sold, but the proceeds of the claimant’s portion <pb
                            n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0220"/>of the same were held by the
                        confederate government, to be refunded to the claimants. The memorial
                        further alleged that, “in the month of February, 1865, the United States
                        troops took military possession of Charleston, S. C, and seized the
                        confederate treasury and all confederate property therein, and shortly
                        afterwards seized and took possession of all property, whatsoever or
                        wheresoever, belonging to or in the possession, custody or control of the
                        said Confederate States, including the proceeds of the cargo above referred
                        to.” The United States interposed a demurrer to the memorial. On the
                        argument of the demurrer, Her Majesty’s counsel, on behalf of the claimant,
                        urged that it was possible for the claimants, under the allegations of the
                        petition, to make out a case of property taken by the United States, “by
                        showing that the proceeds of their sugar were kept separate and distinct
                        from the funds of the confederacy, and marked or noted as theirs, and thus
                        remaining in specie were captured.” That in such case they might be entitled
                        to recover. On this ground the demurrer was overruled by the commission.
                        Subsequently the claimants having failed to make any proof of such capture
                        of their property in specie, and appropriation of it by the United States,
                        the claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>The case of Barron, Forbes &amp; Co., No. 314. In this case the claimants
                        alleged that in the year 1845 one Andres Castillero, a Mexican citizen,
                        became the owner, under the mining laws of Mexico, of a valuable quicksilver
                        mine in California, then a part of the Mexican territory, since known as the
                        New Almaden mine That on the subsequent acquisition of California by the
                        United States they were notified of Castillero’s title. That in 1846 and
                        1847 the claimants duly succeeded to the title of Castillero. That by the
                        treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, between the United States and Mexico, by which
                        treaty Mexico surrendered California to the United States, the faith of the
                        United States was pledged that property of every kind belonging to Mexicans
                        should be “inviolably respected.” That in March, 1851, the Congress of the
                        United States passed a law which in effect proceeded on the assumption that
                        all unoccupied land in California was public property, and which allowed
                        proof to be taken by alleged owners of the titles before commissioners
                        appointed for that purpose, with the right of appeal to the United States
                        courts, and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States; thus casting
                        upon the claimants onerous burdens in the establishment of their lawful
                        title. That this act was, in effect, a confiscation in favor of the. United
                        States of all landed property in California, subject only to its being
                        averted by such proofs; and was, “in its spirit and effect, a violation of
                        the rights of property, and an infraction of the true intent and meaning of
                        the said treaty.” That the claimants filed their claim before the
                        commissioners in California on the 30th September, 1852, and that those
                        commissioners, on the 8th January, 1856, affirmed the claim of the claimants
                        as to a portion of the property, but rejected it as to the remainder, on the
                        ground that their title under the alleged grant, as <pb n="165"
                            xml:id="pg_165" facs="0221"/>to the property in respect of which their
                        claim was rejected, was inchoate and imperfect at the date of the treaty of
                        Guadalupe-Hidalgo. That the United States appealed from, the decision of the
                        commissioners to a tribunal, composed of the circuit and district judges of
                        the United States sitting in California, under the statute; which tribunal,
                        in 1857, issued an injunction restraining the claimants from further working
                        the mine until the further order of the court. That this tribunal finally,
                        on the 18th January, 1861, rendered a decree substantially confirming the
                        decision of the original commissioners, establishing the title of the
                        claimants to a part of the property and rejecting it as to a part. That from
                        this judgment both the claimants and the United States appealed to the
                        Supreme Court of the United States; which court, in the year 1863, rendered
                        a final judgment reversing that part of the decree which established
                        claimants’ title to a portion of the property, and dismissing claimants’
                        appeal as to the other portion of the decree, and remanding the cause with
                        direction to dismiss the entire petition. The report of the case, in the
                        Supreme Court, is found in the second volume of Black’s Reports, page 17,
                        under the title of “The United States <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>.
                        Castillero.”</p>
                    <p>The memorial disclaimed all imputation of intentional wrong by the Supreme
                        Court of the United States, but alleged that their final judgment was
                        erroneous; and further alleged that, immediately after the decision of the
                        Supreme Court, an order was issued by the President of the United States, to
                        the United States marshal for California, directing that the memorialists be
                        ejected from their property, and that it be placed in the possession “of an
                        agent of the United States. That, “while thus under pressure and duress, and
                        threatened with eviction from their property,” by the United States, the
                        claimants gave a quitclaim of their interest in the entire property to a
                        Pennsylvania corporation—the Quicksilver Mining Company—receiving for this
                        conveyance the sum of $1,750,000, and that their grantees had since remained
                        in possession of the mine, “undisturbed by any claim of the United States;"
                        and had received, and still continued to enjoy, a revenue of about
                        $1,000,000 per annum from the mine. It also alleged various acts of
                        unfairness and oppression by the attorneys, agents, and officers of the
                        United States during the pendency of the litigation in the lower courts,
                        before the final appeal to the Supreme Court. The claimants claimed an award
                        for about $16,000,000, besides interest. A demurrer was interposed to the
                        memorial, on behalf of the United States, on the following grounds: <list>

                                alleged subjects, appears from the memorial. They became parties
                                litigant before the Supreme Court, a judicial tribunal of the United
                                States, in respect of lands lying within the United States, and in a
                                case in which the court had unquestioned jurisdiction. Their rights
                                were, as they themselves admit, honestly and fairly, but, (as they
                                allege,) erroneously adjudicated there. Without awaiting eviction
                                from the premises, they voluntarily parted with their entire claim
                                to the lands, mining privileges, and all enjoyments and profits of
                                the same; that if their grantees had been evicted from possession,
                                the claimants could not be the parties to claim redress, having
                                voluntarily surrendered all their rights; but their grantees had not
                                been evicted; the whole estate with its vast revenues had continued
                                to be enjoyed by the parties to whose enjoyment the claimants
                                voluntarily ceded it.</item>

                        California to expel the claimants from their property, constituted acts
                        against the property of British subjects, bringing them within the
                        jurisdiction of the commission. That the conveyance by the claimants to
                        their grantees was a conveyance under duress of these acts, and did not
                        discharge the liability of the United States, except so far as the amount
                        received by the claimants from their grantees as purchase-money might go to
                        reduce the amount of their loss. That it was within the jurisdiction of the
                        commission to review the judgment of the Supreme Court, and if found

                    <p>George. H. and James W. B. Money, No. 324. The memorial in this case alleged,
                        in effect, that the claimants were the owners of certain shares in the Bank
                        of Louisiana, at New Orleans, which shares paid large dividends up to the
                        year 1861; that at the close of that year, “in consequence of the war in
                        America between the Northern and Southern States, and of the occupation of
                        New Orleans and of the bank by General Butler, the bank ceased to pay any
                        dividend or bonus,” and the claimants have never since been paid any
                        dividends; that at the time of the cessation of the dividends the shares
                        were worth $31,200, but that since that date they had been substantially
                        valueless. The claimants claimed $33,720, besides interest. On demurrer by
                        the United States, the claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                    <p>William B. Hodges, No. 354. This claimant, by his memorial, stated seven
                        distinct claims against the United States, upon which he claimed awards to
                        the amount of $1,474,155, besides interest.</p>

                        <item>For 200 bales of cotton alleged to have been owned by the claimant in
                            July, 1864, at Fort Adams, Mississippi. This cotton was alleged to have
                            been seized by the United States military forces at Fort Adams, in
                            August, 1864, and 178 bales of it sent to New Orleans; the remaining 22
                            bales he alleged were carried off by the teamsters who tied fearing that
                            their teams, as well as the cotton, would be seized by the United States
                            officers. The cotton brought to New Orleans was, on its arrival, turned
                            over with other cotton by General Canby to B. F. Flanders, a Treasury
                            agent of the United States. The claimant brought suit against Flanders
                            in a Louisiana court to recover the cotton, which suit was afterwards
                            discontinued with other like suits brought by other claimants of cotton
                            against <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0225"/>Flanders, on a

                            according to their shares, as stipulated between themselves, by which
                            stipulation Hodges was entitled to 122 bales. He claimed damages for the
                            78 bales which he failed to receive, and for depreciation of price on
                            the 122 bales received by him, and for legal expenses incurred, to the
                            amount of $106,850, besides interest.</item>

                            of Major-General Banks, then in command there, requiring that all cotton
                            coming to New Orleans should pay a tax of $5 per bale; sugar, $1 per
                            hogshead, &amp;c., &amp;c. The claimant alleged that he paid said taxes
                            under protest to the amount of $20,924, for which amount, with interest,
                            he claimed damages.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>

                            United States, near Alexandria, La., in March, 1864, for which he

                            Mississippi, which he alleged was, “by the neglect and inefficiency of
                            the naval and military officers in command of the district, entirely and
                            totally lost to your memorialist," and for which he claimed $224,600,

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The fifth claim was for a quantity of sugar and molasses, alleged to
                            have been stored by the memorialist in March, 1864, upon Old River, in
                            Point Coupee, Louisiana. The claimant alleged that he sent a vessel in
                            March, 1864, to remove this sugar and molasses, but that the vessel was
                            prevented by the United States gun-boat fleet from landing and taking on
                            board the sugar and molasses, and that in consequence the sugar and
                            molasses “were entirely lost to your memorialist.” For this he claimed
                            $35,175, besides interest.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The sixth claim was for a quantity of sugar, alleged to have been
                            purchased in March, 1864, by the claimant, from one Thorne, a resident
                            of Saint Martin’s Parish, La., where the sugar was situated. The
                            claimant alleged that he hired a United States transport from the
                            quartermaster of the United States Army, to whom he paid the sum of
                            $3,000, to bring out the sugar from the plantation, where it was stored,
                            to Brashear City, La., to be thence transported to New Orleans. That 84
                            hogsheads of the 300 purchased were brought out by said transport to
                            Brashear City, where it was seized by the United States authorities, and
                            libelled in the United States district court, but said libel was
                            dismissed and the sugar surrendered. The United States authorities,
                            however, prohibited the transport which the claimant had hired from
                            returning for the remainder of the sugar; and, in consequence of such
                            refusal, he alleged that the sugar was shortly afterwards destroyed by
                            confederate scouts. For his losses in this regard, he claimed $81,565,
                            besides interest.</item>

                        <item>The seventh claim was for a large quantity of cotton alleged to have
                            been purchased by the claimant in the States of Louisiana and
                            Mississippi, 1,000 bales of which he alleged to have been destroyed by
                            troops of the United States, and the remainder to have been lost and
                            destroyed through the negligence and default of the United States
                            authorities. Under this claim he claimed an award for $580,000, besides
                            interest.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>During all the transactions in question the claimant was domiciled in New
                        Orleans.</p>
                    <p>The questions arising in the case were, to a large extent, questions of fact,
                        the recapitulation of which here would be unprofitable. In regard to most of
                        the property set forth in claims 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, it was contended by
                        the United States that the claimant’s title was invalid, as obtained by
                        unlawful purchases from enemies of the United States of property within the
                        enemy’s country, in violation of the non-intercourse statutes of the United
                        States, and of the general laws of war. The permits under which most of this
                        property was alleged to have been purchased were also claimed by the United
                        States to have been irregular, collusive, and fraudulent, issued in
                        violation of law, and giving to the claimant no right to trade within the
                        enemy’s country.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the claim for payment of alleged illegal taxes, being the
                        claimant’s second claim, it was contended on the part of the United States
                        that the tax was a lawful one, imposed by the commanding officer at New
                        Orleans, while that city was governed solely by martial law, as a condition
                        for the carrying on of trade in that city; and its proceeds properly applied
                        to the relief of the poor of the city, with whose care the military
                        authorities were of necessity charged. That it was a tax imposed upon all
                        persons trading in the city without discrimination, and voluntarily paid by
                        the claimant in common with all other persons in like situation in New
                        Orleans. Various other questions in regard to all the claims were raised and
                        discussed by the respective counsel, but they were mainly such as relate
                        only to the special circumstances of the case and the questions of fact
                        involved in the evidence in relation to them.</p>
                    <p>The commission made an award in favor of the claimant for $34,150, Mr.
                        Commissioner Frazer dissenting. I am advised that this award was made
                        entirely in respect of the claimant’s first claim above recited, and of the
                        amount paid by the claimant to the United States quartermaster for the use
                        of the transport, as set forth in the sixth claim.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Peter Maxwell, No. 385, the memorial alleged that the
                        claimant, during the entire war, was a resident of Liverpool. That in the
                        year 1862 proceedings were instituted in the United States court for the
                        district of Kansas for the confiscation of four lots of land situated in the
                        city of Leavenworth, Kans., a State not in rebellion, on the alleged ground
                        that the claimant was a rebel in arms against the United States. The only
                        notice of the proceedings to the defendant <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171"
                            facs="0227"/>was a constructive notice by publication pursuant to the
                        statute. No appearance being bad by the now claimant, a decree of
                        confiscation of two of the lots passed by default. As to the other two, the
                        libel was dismissed.</p>
                    <p>The proofs before the commission clearly showed that the allegations in the
                        libel as to the claimant being engaged in the rebellion against the United
                        States were unfounded.</p>
                    <p>The commission made an award in favor of the claimant for $1,782.</p>
                    <p>Bailey &amp; Leetham, claimants, No. 386. The claimants were the owners of
                        the British steamship Labuan, which, on the 5th of November, 1862, was in
                        the port of New York laden with a cargo of merchandise destined for
                        Matamoras. On that day her master presented the manifest to the proper
                        officer of the custom-house at New York for clearance, but such clearance
                        was refused, and the refusal continued up to the 13th of December, 1862, on
                        which clay it was granted. The memorial alleged that this detention was by
                        reason of instructions received by the custom-house officers from the proper
                        authorities of the United States to detain the Labuan, in common with other
                        vessels of great speed destined for ports in the Gulf of Mexico, to prevent
                        the transmission of information relative to the departure or proposed
                        departure of a military expedition fitted out by the authority of the said
                        United States. The memorial claimed damages for the detention $38,000, being
                        at the rate of $1,000 per day, the memorial alleging that on a former
                        seizure and detention of the same vessel, from February to May, 1862, when
                        libelled as prize, this rate of compensation for the detention had been
                        awarded to the owners by the district court of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the detention of the
                        Labuan, under the circumstances alleged in the memorial, was within the
                        legitimate and recognized powers of the United States; that it was no
                        infringement upon the rules of international law or upon any treaty
                        stipulations between the United States and Great Britain, and that it gave
                        no right of reclamation in favor of the claimants against the United States;
                        that the right of self-protection, by temporarily refusing clearance to
                        vessels through which information of great importance in regard to military
                        movements is likely to reach the enemy, must be regarded as of necessity
                        permissible to a government engaged in war; that at the time of this
                        detention important military movements then in progress in connection with
                        the occupation of New Orleans by the Federal forces, including the dispatch
                        of General Banks, with large re-enforcements, to supersede General Butler in
                        the command there, were in progress, and made it of the utmost importance
                        that these movements should be carefully kept secret from the rebels; that
                        the detention of the Labuan was not by any discrimination against her as a
                        British vessel, or against British vessels as such. All vessels capable of
                        such a rate of speed as to make their departure <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172"
                            facs="0228"/>dangerous in this regard were detained alike. That no claim
                        had ever been made by the British government, through the usual diplomatic
                        channels, upon the United States for compensation; and that it could not be
                        believed that such claim would not have been made if Her Majesty’s
                        government had considered such a claim valid. The counsel for the United
                        States cited, in the connection, the letter of Mr. Stuart, Her Majesty’s
                        minister at Washington, to Mr. Seward, of 1st August, 1862, (U. S. Dip.
                        Cor., 1862, 1863, part 1, p. 273,) upon a somewhat analogous question, in
                        which Mr. Stuart says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I have been instructed to state to you that Her Majesty’s government,
                                after considering these dispatches, in connection with the
                                law-officers of the Crown, are of opinion that it is competent for
                                the United States, as a belligerent power, to protect itself within
                                its own ports and territory by refusing clearances to vessels laden
                                with contraband of war or other specified articles, as well as to
                                vessels which are believed to be bound to confederate ports. And
                                that so long as such precautions are adopted, equally and
                                indifferently in all cases, without reference to the nationality or
                                origin of any particular vessel or goods, they do not afford any
                                just ground of complaint.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The case of the detention of the Labuan, it was contended on the part of the
                        United States, was governed by the same principles and justified by the same
                        rules as the cases referred to by Mr. Stuart. The counsel referred to the
                        decision of the commission upon the American claims against Great Britain,
                        growing out of the prohibition of the exportation of saltpetre at Calcutta,
                        (American claims, Nos. 11, 12, 16, 18,) hereinbefore reported, and in which
                        such prohibition was held by the commission not to involve a violation
                        either of international law or of treaty stipulation; and urged that the
                        principles which would sustain the validity of such prohibition must also
                        include such a case as the detention of the Labuan.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the claimant maintained that the detention of the Labuan was
                        in effect a deprivation of the owners of the use of their property for the
                        time of the detention for the public benefit; that it was in effect a taking
                        of private property for public use, always justified by the necessity of the
                        State, but likewise always involving the obligation of compensation. He
                        cited 3d Phillimore, 42, and Dana’s Wheaton, 152, <hi rend="italic"
                        >n.</hi></p>
                    <p>The commission unanimously made an award in favor of the claimant for
                        $37,392.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Catharine J. Johnson, executrix, No. 449, the memorial alleged
                        that the claimant’s testator was the sole registered owner of the British
                        schooner James Douglas, which-vessel, while on a voyage from Cuba to New
                        York, met with disaster which led to her being abandoned by the master and
                        crew; that she was subsequently fallen in with by a United States vessel of
                        war, which took her into the port of Beaufort, North Carolina, where she was
                        appropriated to the use of the United States Government; that on application
                        to that Government for her restoration, the Secretary of the Navy gave
                        directions that <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0229"/>the vessel be
                        surrendered to her owner on his renouncing all claims for the use of the
                        vessel by the United States; that, notwithstanding these orders, the vessel
                        had never been restored to her owner, but was still in the port of Beaufort
                        under the control of the officials of the United States. The claimant
                        claimed damages $7,000, besides interest.</p>
                    <p>The proofs showed that, after the vessel was brought into port, and before
                        any claim was interposed on behalf of her owner, some use had been made of
                        the vessel by the Navy Department; that the claim of the owner was
                        interposed through the British legation, and that the United States
                        Government at once offered to surrender her on payment of a reasonable
                        salvage to the officers and crew of the vessel which brought her in. Some
                        objection being made to the payment of the salvage asked, the United States
                        Government directed her surrender without salvage, on the claimant’s waiving
                        claim for compensation for the use that had been made of her while in port.
                        No objection was made to this condition, and no further claim was ever
                        advanced by any person for the vessel. She remained lying at Beaufort
                        waiting requisition of her owner, and nothing further was ever heard of the
                        matter until the filing of the memorial before the commission.</p>
                    <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting) made an award in the
                        following words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>We think it does not appear that the United States appropriated the
                                vessel, and we regard it as yet being the claimant’s property. The
                                claim is, therefore, disallowed.</p>

                    <p>The high contracting parties agree that all claims on the part of
                        corporations, companies, or private individuals (citizens of the United
                        States) upon the government of Her Britannic Majesty, arising out of acts
                        committed against the person or property of citizens of the United States
                        during the period between the thirteenth of April, eighteen hundred and
                        sixty-one, and the ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five,

                        Britannic Majesty during the same period, which may have been presented to
                        either government for its interposition with the other, and which yet remain
                        unsettled, as well as any other such claims which may be presented within
                        the time specified in Article XIV of this treaty, shall be referred to three
                        commissioners, to be appointed in the following manner, that is to say: One
                        commissioner shall be named by the President of the United States, one by
                        Her Britannic Majesty, and a third by the President of the United States and
                        Her Britannic Majesty conjointly; and in case the third commissioner shall
                        not have been so named within a period of three months from the date of the
                        exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, then the third <pb n="176"

                        representative at Washington of His Majesty the King of Spain. In case of
                        the death, absence, or incapacity of any commissioner, or in the event of
                        any commissioner omitting or ceasing to act, the vacancy shall be filled in
                        the manner hereinbefore provided for making the original appointment the
                        period of three months in case of such substitution being calculated from
                        the date of the happening of the vacancy.</p>
                    <p>The commissioners so named shall meet at Washington at the earliest
                        convenient period after they have been respectively named; and shall, before
                        proceeding to any business, make and subscribe a solemn declaration that
                        they will impartially and carefully examine and decide, to the best of their
                        judgment, and according to justice and equity, all such claims as shall be
                        laid before them on the part of the governments of the United States and of
                        Her Britannic Majesty, respectively; and such declaration shall be entered

                    <p>The commissioners shall then forthwith proceed to the investigation of the
                        claims which shall be presented to them. They shall investigate and decide
                        such claims in such order and in such manner as they may think proper, but
                        upon such evidence or information only as shall be furnished by or on behalf
                        of the respective governments. They shall be bound to receive and consider
                        all written documents or statements which may be presented to them by or on
                        behalf of the respective governments in support of or in answer to any
                        claim, and to hear, if required, one person on each side on behalf of each
                        government, as counsel or agent for such government, on each and every
                        separate claim. A majority of the commissioners shall be sufficient for an

                        said treaty, as follows, that is to say:</p>
                    <p>We award that the Government of the United States of America shall pay to the
                        government of Her Britannic Majesty, within twelve months from the date
                        hereof, the sum of one million nine hundred and twenty-nine thousand eight
                        hundred and nineteen dollars, in gold, subject to the deduction provided for
                        by article sixteen of the treaty aforesaid, for and in full satisfaction of
                        the several claims on the part of corporations, companies, or private
                        individuals, subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, upon the Government of the
                        United States, arising out of acts committed against the persons or property
                        of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, during the period between the
                        thirteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and the
                        ninth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, inclusive;
                        said sum being the aggregate of the several separate awards upon such
                        claims, made in writing, in duplicate, and signed by us or such of us as
                        assented to said separate awards.</p>
                    <p>And all other such claims on the part of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty
                        against the United States which have been presented and prosecuted for our
                        award, have been and are hereby disallowed or dismissed, in manner and form
                        as will appear by the several separate awards in writing concerning the
                        same, signed as aforesaid.</p>
                    <p>Certain other claims on the part of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty against
                        the United States were also presented, but were afterward, and before any
                        award was made thereon, withdrawn by the agent of Her Britannic Majesty, as
                        will appear by the record of the proceedings of the commission, kept in
                        duplicate, and which will be delivered to each government herewith.</p>
                    <p>And we award that all claims on the part of corporations, companies, or
                        private individuals, citizens of the United States, upon the government of
                        Her Britaunic Majesty, arising out of acts committed against the persons or
                        property of citizens of the United States, between the thirteenth day of
                        April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and the ninth day of April,
                        one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, inclusive, not being claims
                        growing out of the acts of vessels referred to in the first article of said
                        treaty, have been and are hereby disallowed; separate awards upon each of
                        said claims having been made in writing, in duplicate, and signed by us or
                        such of us as assented to such separate awards.</p>
                    <p>And we refer to the several separate awards made and signed as aforesaid, as
                        a part of this our final award—it being our intent that the proceedings of
                        this commission shall have the force and effect named and provided in the
                        seventeenth article of said treaty.</p>

                    <p>These cases arise out of certain legislative ordinances of the
                        governor-general of India, dated respectively December 21, 1861, and January
                        3, <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0287"/>1862. By the first of these
                        ordinances the exportation of saltpetre from India was prohibited after that
                        date, except to London and Liverpool, in British vessels, under penalty of
                        confiscation: <hi rend="italic">provided</hi>, that the prohibition should
                        not extend to cases where permits to export <hi rend="italic">had
                            previously</hi> been granted.</p>
                    <p>By the second ordinance the provi<gap quantity="1" unit="characters"/>o of
                        the first, excepting cases where permits to export had been granted prior to
                        December 21, 1861, was rescinded; and the article was required to be
                        relanded from vessels in port. The first ordinance was also so modified as
                        to permit the article to be exported in British vessels to <hi rend="italic"
                            >any</hi> port in the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Bush <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, the vessel had a permit to
                        export the saltpeter on board before the date of the first ordinance. She
                        continued to load other goods, placing them upon the saltpetre; and being in
                        the port of Calcutta when the second ordinance was proclaimed, she was not
                        permitted to sail as laden.</p>
                    <p>In the other cases the saltpetre was laden when the first ordinance took
                        effect, but custom-house permits to export it had <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                        been obtained. In each case the vessels were American and bound for the
                        United States. They were, by the ordinances, required to unlade the
                        saltpetre; but by special arrangement with authorities it was allowed to
                        remain on board, and the vessels waited until the ordinances were rescinded,
                        a period of nearly two months. By this arrangement, it seems that less
                        injury resulted than would have occurred if the saltpetre had been unladen.
                        Damage from Great Britain is claimed for this detention.</p>
                    <p>The statute of 24 and 25 Vict., chap. 67, seems to have authorized the
                        ordinances in question, not specifically, but by reason of the general power
                        of legislation which it conferred on the authorities in India.</p>
                    <p>Though Her Majesty was at that time at peace with all the world, yet there
                        existed a reasonable apprehension of speedy war with the United States on
                        account of the recent arrest of Messrs. Mason and Slidell on board the royal
                        mail-steamer Trent, on the high seas. This is an element of importance,
                        establishing that the ordinances of the governor-general of India were
                        proclaimed, not wantonly, bnt as an exercise of authority with a view, <hi
                            rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, to protection and self-defense, when the
                        danger of war seemed probable.</p>
                    <p>A diplomatic correspondence concerning these claims ensued between the two
                        governments. The facts were not controverted; but conceding them, the
                        British government, advised by the law-officers of the Crown, denied all
                        liability, while the American Government very positively asserted it. This
                        alone imparts importance to the question, and suggests that it should
                        receive the most careful consideration.</p>

                    <p>If the case is within the treaty of 1815 it is, of course, immaterial to
                        determine what should be our award in the absence of treaty stipulations. By
                        the convention of August 6, 1827, that of 1815 was continued indefinitely,
                        terminable on one year’s notice, which was never given. This was before the
                        statute 24 and 25 Vict., though I do not deem the fact important.</p>
                    <p>If by treaty the British government contracted <hi rend="italic">not to
                            do</hi> that which before it might lawfully and without liability have
                        done, it cannot afterward break its contract without a just liability to

                    <p>Was there, then, a contract by treaty, by the terms of which Great Britain
                        engaged not to do the things complained of?</p>
                    <p>By the third article of the treaty of 1815, His Britannic Majesty agreed that
                        citizens of the United States might “freely carry on trade between Calcutta,
                        Madras, Bombay, and Prince of Wales Island, and the United States, in all
                        articles of which the importation and exportation to and from <hi
                            rend="italic">the said territories</hi> shall not be entirely
                        prohibited." The “said territories" can only mean Calcutta, Madras, Bombay,
                        and Prince of Wales Island; for those only were the territories previously
                        mentioned. To carry goods from Liverpool, or elsewhere in the United
                        Kingdom, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Calcutta for sale, would, it can hardly
                        be questioned, be an <hi rend="italic">importation</hi> to “<hi
                            rend="italic">said territories</hi>" in the sense of the treaty so,
                        then, as long as the importation of a given article from Liverpool to
                        Calcutta was not prohibited, it might also be imported from New York by
                        citizens of the United States. In short, American merchants, by that article
                        of the treaty, acquired the liberty to compete with British merchants in
                        supplying the markets of “<hi rend="italic">said territories</hi>.” This is
                        the natural import of the language; and if these claims arose out of similar
                        interference with American <hi rend="italic">importations to</hi> Calcutta,
                        say the prohibition to unlade an American cargo under a like ordinance,
                        proclaimed after the arrival of the vessel at Calcutta, I can scarcely
                        conceive that a demand for redress would be denied by Her Majesty’s
                        government. I think that in such a case the language of the treaty would be
                        deemed too plain to admit of construction. And I cannot but think that as to
                            <hi rend="italic">importations</hi> to “said territories,” that language
                        expresses the exact intention of the high contracting parties.</p>
                    <p>As to <hi rend="italic">exhortations</hi>, it is not, I think, fairly
                        susceptible of controversy that the literal import of the language used
                        concedes to American citizens rights exactly co-extensive with those which
                        relate to importations. If not to prohibit the carrying of an article from
                        Liverpool to the market of Calcutta is to allow that article to be <hi
                            rend="italic">imported to</hi> Calcutta, in the sense of the treaty;
                        though it seems to me plain that not to prohibit the carrying of saltpetre
                            <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Calcutta <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Liverpool
                        is to allow saltpetre ‘ to be exported <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Calcutta.
                        In other words, by the plainest language that could possibly have been
                        employed, the quoted words of the treaty concede to the United States a
                        right to export and import from or to “those territories" alike, unless
                        either as to specified articles shall be prohibited entirely, which is not
                        done if exports be allowed <hi rend="italic">from</hi> “those territories,"
                        or if imports be allowed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> “those territories."</p>
                    <p>The question remains, was the taking of saltpetre from Calcutta to Liverpool
                        an exportation of that article <hi rend="italic">from Calcutta</hi> in the
                        sense of the treaty?</p>
                    <p>It is admitted in the intelligent argument of Her Majesty’s counsel that in
                        some sense the carriage of an article from Calcutta, “whether to a port in
                        the United Kingdom or to a foreign port, is an <hi rend="italic"
                            >exportation</hi>," nor can this be questioned philologically. The word
                        itself includes the former as well as the latter, whether reference be had
                        to its strict sense or its popular use. For proof of this use, indeed, it is
                        only necessary to refer to the very ordinances complained of in these cases,
                        in both of which the word is several times used in that very sense, and
                        certainly without impropriety. It is also used by Earl Russell in the same
                        sense, in his correspondence with Mr. Adams concerning these claims. It is
                        also used in the statute laws of both countries, as well to indicate the
                        carrying of goods from distant colonies or possessions as from countries
                        wholly foreign.</p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0289"/>
                    <p>So much for the mere words of the treaty. Looking only at the language
                        quoted, the conclusion would seem to be that Great Britain engaged by the
                        treaty to permit citizens of the United States to export from Calcutta to
                        the United States such articles as she should permit to be exported to the
                        United Kingdom or any other place; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, the
                        exportation of which should not be “<hi rend="italic">entirely</hi>
                        prohibited.” But the words of a treaty must be construed with reference to
                        their subject-matter, so as to forward the intent of the high contracting
                        parties, and not defeat it, and so as to avoid absurd results.</p>
                    <p>Now, the intent of the third article of the treaty of 1815 undoubtedly was to
                        give to the United States the liberty of direct trade with the places
                        mentioned in the East Indies; so that Americans might purchase and sell <hi
                            rend="italic">there</hi>, and with their own ships transport goods to
                        and from their own country, from and to those places. The mischief sought to
                        be remedied was that the United States Government was previously obliged to
                        supply herself with the products of those places at second hand in the
                        markets of Great Britain, and could only exchange her products with them
                        through the same indirect channel.</p>
                    <p>Now, it must be seen at once that if the British government reserved to
                        itself the right asserted, (continuing herself to trade there,) then the
                        concession which seemed to be made was a mere delusion and snare to American
                        merchants, giving no right which Great Britain might not withdraw at any
                        moment with advantage to her own merchants at home. In short, she could at
                        will resume the entire monopoly of the trade with her East Indian
                        posessions; for it must be borne in mind that the language under
                        consideration, by virtue of which it is contended that the ordinances in
                        question can be justified, applies quite as well to all other commodities as
                        to saltpetre, and to imports as well as to exports. A treaty stipulation
                        with such a meaning would be worse than an utter nullity.</p>
                    <p>There are some other clauses found in this article of the treaty which need
                        to be considered. There is the clause usual in commercial treaties, which
                        makes citizens of the United States trading in those places “subject in all
                        respects to the laws and regulations of the Britsh government from time to
                        time established.” Of this it is, perhaps, sufficient to say, that it cannot
                        be supposed that such a clause is a reservation of authority to prohibit the
                        very trade which it was the leading purpose of the article to allow. In the
                        language of Earl Russell concerning the same clause, in the first article of
                        the treaty, (letter to Lord Lyons of December 17, 1862,) "it does not mean
                        that the principal engagement itself may be nullified, or may be rendered
                        illusory either in whole or in part; * * * but merely that obedience is to
                        be rendered by foreign traders * * to all the laws and statutes enacted * *
                        for the ordinary and legitimate purposes of internal government and
                        administration. * * I have to observe (he adds) that it is a well-known
                        maxim that treaties are to be interpreted in good faith, and in such a
                        manner that they may have their effect and not be rendered vague or
                        illusory.” And Mr. Seward’s reply (letter to Lord Lyons of January 9, 1863)
                        contains a virtual admission of the correctness of the principle so well
                        stated by Earl Russell.</p>
                    <p>It may be added that it is impossible to perceive the force of the argument
                        that a year’s notice should be given to terminate the treaty, if it was
                        provided that it could be effectually nullified by one of the parties, at
                        will, by an act of legislation.</p>
                    <p>But there remains a consideration of much greater weight, as I think. <pb
                            n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0290"/>than those which have been alluded
                        to above. Self-preservation and self-defense are sacred rights of nations as
                        well as of individuals; and nothing in a treaty should be taken to have
                        impaired the right of a nation to make prudent preparations for them by
                        husbanding its means of war, when that event seems probable, unless the
                        terms of the stipulation will admit of no other construction.</p>
                    <p>There is a provision in the article under consideration which shows clearly
                        that the exigency of possible war was distinctly in mind when the treaty was
                        concluded. Indeed, such were the events then existing in the history of both
                        counties that it would have been remarkable if it had not been. The
                        provision is in those words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Provided only that it shall not he lawful for them, (citizens of the
                                United States,) in any time of war between the British government
                                and any state or power whatever, to export from the said
                                territories, without the special permission of the British
                                government, any military stores or naval stores, or rice.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>This exception to the general liberty to trade conceded before, is free from
                        ail ambiguity. That it covers only the case of actual war, shows most
                        clearly that it was not deemed important, and was not intended to make any
                        reservation for the case of war merely apprehended. The one thing being
                        expressed, all else is excluded. <hi rend="italic">Expressio unius est
                            exclusio alterius</hi>. This maxim of interpretation is sensible and
                        sound, and I think never was more applicable in any case than here.</p>
                    <p>If I have correctly interpreted the treaty, then it is of no consequence
                        Whatever that the ordinances applied to all nations alike. A specific
                        engagement definite in its terms can be fulfilled only by the performance of
                        it in all its substantial parts. It is not to be confounded with an
                        engagement to extend only the privileges which shall be allowed to other
                        powers or to the most favored nation.</p>
                    <p>These considerations seem to me to establish very clearly the validity of
                        these claims, and I am of opinion that damages should be awarded
                        accordingly.</p>

                    <p>Henderson, in whose behalf Great Britain makes this claim, is a British
                        subject by birth, and has taken no steps toward becoming naturalized in this
                        or any other country. He became domiciled near Port Hudson, in the parish of
                        West Feliciana, in 1850, employed in cultivating and dealing in cotton, and
                        has ever since resided there. There is no room to doubt that it was his
                        voluntary and permanent domicile. It is not even alleged that he maintained
                        a personal neutrality during any period of the rebellion, and there is no
                        proof whatever of that fact. In June, 1863, he owned in the neighborhood of
                        112 bales of cotton. After twenty-seven days of effort by continuous
                        fighting, General Banks, commanding the United States forces investing the
                        fortified town of Port Hudson, held by the rebels, found himself unable to
                        carry the works by assault, and thereupon commenced a regular siege of the
                        place. Cotton found in the neighborhood, including Henderson’s, was, without
                        discrimination, seized by the United States forces, and used almost
                        exclusively in the construction of fortifications, a purpose to which cotton
                        in bales <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0291"/>is known to be well
                        adapted in the emergencies of a siege. The officer who took Henderson’s

                            himself to its protection, thus being <hi rend="italic">in law</hi> an
                            enemy of the United States, without even pretending that he was <hi
                                rend="italic">in fact</hi> neutral, may be recognized as entitled to
                            maintain a claim against it for property appropriated by its invading
                            armies, when no citizen of the United States could under like
                            circumstances claim such consideration, is a proposition to which I must
                            enter an earnest and emphatic dissent. If it has any support in equity,
                            justice, or the public law, then I am greatly in error.</item>

                        <item><p>The cotton was the property of an enemy of the United States, so
                                recognized by every writer upon international law, and so held by
                                all tribunals, both American and British as well as continental, in
                                every reported case involving the question. The mixed commission,
                                constituted under the convention of 1858, between the two countries,
                                so held in Laurent’s case. Indeed, it went further, and held that an
                                unnaturalized Englishman voluntarily domiciled in a country at war
                                with the United States was not even to be regarded as a British
                                subject; thus going a little too far, as I think.</p>
                            <p>The property of Henderson was as liable to capture as the property of
                                Jeff. Davis himself, or any rebel in arms. I believe this is not
                                questioned. That the property itself was a proper subject of capture
                                on land under the modern rules by which civilized nations govern
                                themselves in war, seems to me to be quite as clear.</p>
                            <p>The legislation and the known practice of the rebel authorities made
                                it so. They made cotton the basis of their public credit by a policy
                                which aimed to deal largely in it on government account, to purchase
                                it even before it was grown, and hypothecate it as security for the
                                payment of loans, with the proceeds of which they did, to a large
                                extent, supply themselves with arms and munitions of war, and with a
                                fleet of armed vessels to infest the ocean and destroy American
                                commerce. They committed it to the flames, whether owned by friend
                                or foe, rather than permit it to reach the markets of the world
                                otherwise than through their own ports; thus endeavoring by warlike
                                operations to secure to <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0292"
                                />themselves a monopoly in supplying the foreign demand, that they
                                might thereby constrain nations abroad to aid them in their
                                struggle. In short, cotton was a special and formidable foundation
                                of the rebel military power. It was more important than arms or
                                ships of war, for it supplied these and all else beside. It was more
                                potent than gold, for it not only commanded gold, but it largely
                                enlisted in behalf of the rebels the interests of foreigners whose
                                manufacturing industry was in a measure paralyzed because this
                                staple was needed to keep it in motion. The necessities and purposes
                                of war, therefore, required its capture at every opportunity more
                                imperatively than the capture of munitions and implements of war;
                                indeed, that necessity was quite as pressing and certainly as humane
                                as the killing of men in battle; for it was no less efficient as a
                                means of accomplishing the subjugation of the rebel armies, and
                                re-establishing the national authority. It is to me astonishing if
                                there is a difference of opinion upon this subject.</p>
                            <p>The Supreme Court of the United States, recognizing to the fullest
                                extent all the limitations which the practice of nations has lately
                                engrafted upon the right of capture upon land, so held in the case
                                of a loyal American widow. (See the case of Mrs. Alexander’s Cotton,
                                2 Black.) This is high authority, especially when it is remembered
                                that that august tribunal has certainly exhibited no tendency
                                whatever to give undue license to military authority or warlike
                                operations. Complaint, if any, has been altogether in the other
                                direction. But I would be quite content, in the absence of any
                                authority, to trust the question with the common sense of all
                                civilized nations so long as war in any form shall be recognized as
                                a lawful method of deciding differences. If the capture was rightful
                                by the laws of war, it would be a novelty in international law that
                                its exercise involves an obligation to make compensation.</p></item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>But another point remains, which in my judgement is absolutely
                            conclusive agaisnt any award on account of this claim, if the rules of
                            international law should control the determination of the question.
                            Henderson was voluntarily and permanently domiciled in one of the
                            rebellious States, the territory held by the so-called Confederate
                            States recognized by Great Britain as a belligerent. By that act of
                            recognition all British subjects were bound. If they chose to remain in
                            that part of the world, they voluntarily took the chances of war and
                            intrusted their interests to the protection of that organization. They
                            must look to it for protection from the results of war; and now that it
                            has, by the fortunes of war, been exterminated, the country of their
                            origin has no right (save possibly in exceptionally flagrant cases) to
                            intervene in their behalf as against the United States for
                            indemnification. This I think is as clearly established as a rule of
                            international law as anything can be. It was so held in Laurent’s case,
                                <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>. It was so declared by the American
                            Secretary of State in reference to the bombardment of Grey town, and was
                            then assented to by the English government under the advice of the
                            law-officers of the Crown. The Attorney-General on that occasion
                            declared in Parliament that <hi rend="italic">every jurist admitted
                                it</hi>. He said “the principle which governed such cases was that
                            the citizens of foreign states who resided within the arena of war had
                            no right to demand compensation from either of the belligerents,” (See
                            Wheat. Int. Law, 173—note by Lawrence.) This rule is so much in the
                            interest of the peace of nations that it should be steadfastly
                            maintained. A right to interfere is so intimately associated with the
                            duty of doing so, that any relaxation of this principle would but
                            multiply occasions of war and afford too many opportunities for that
                            armed intervention in the quarrels of others which is sometimes sought,
                            in vain, by ambitious rulers.</item>

                    <p>The capture or destruction of property on land belonging to individual
                        enemies is justified by the modern law of nations, if there be military
                        reasons for it; in the absence of good military reasons such captures are
                        generally without the support of the public law. When such reasons do exist,
                        such capture or destruction is, in the nature of things, quite as proper as
                        the capture or destruction of such property on the high seas.</p>
                    <p>The latter is maintained because an enemy’s commerce and navigation are “the
                        sinews of his naval power,” to take or destroy which is, therefore, a
                        legitimate act of war. (Wheat. Int. Law; Lawrence, 626.)</p>
                    <p>“The sinews" of his <hi rend="italic">military</hi> power on land must, in
                        view of the natural law, be equally the subject of capture or destruction by
                        an invading army. Cotton was held to be such by the Supreme Court, in the
                        case of Mrs. Alexander’s cotton, (2 Wall., 404.) The reasoning of the
                        opinion of the Chief Justice in that case is, I think, unanswerable.</p>
                    <p>The war of the American rebellion was a civil war—an immense one, too, and
                        the Government had all the rights of war which it would have had if its
                        enemy had been an independent nation. Even the rebel organization was
                        recognized by Her Majesty’s government as a belligerent, <hi rend="italic"
                            >i. e.</hi>, having the rights of war 5 and certainly that government is
                        thereby estopped from denying, and, indeed, never has denied, that
                        belligerent rights also belonged to the Government of the United States.
                        Every act of war recognized as lawful by the public law between independent
                        states at war was, therefore, lawful on the part of the United States, and
                        involved no cause for reclamation on the part of neutrals. On this ground
                        only, as a lawful belligerent act, could a blockade be maintained. The
                        subject is discussed very fully by the Supreme Court in the Prize Cases, 2
                        Black; and I think the reasoning of that court is conclusive.</p>
                    <p>Neutral’s property in the enemy’s territory stands exactly on the same
                        footing as any other property found there. Indeed, a neutral domiciled there
                            <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an enemy in view of the public law. He may be
                        compelled to serve the enemy as a soldier even, and his property must
                        contribute to the support of the enemy’s hostile operations without
                        reference to his national character. I think that all authorities, British,
                        continental, and American, are in accord upon the proposition that the
                        belligerent right of capture of movable property on land is in no respect
                        affected by the nationality of its owner.</p>
                    <p>Whatever is lawfully done in the exercise of belligerent rights cannot
                        involve any liability contemplated by the treaty 5 it cannot possibly be a
                        tort.</p>
                    <p>The belligerent right of capture must not be confounded with the right of
                        eminent domain, which is a civil right exercised in virtue of sovereignty.
                        The two are wholly distinct and rest upon different grounds.</p>
                    <p>Grant’s case, (C. Cls., 1863,) cited by Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel, was
                        not a destruction of enemy’s property; it was not in the enemy’s lines, nor
                        in a seceding State. It was a destruction of property in Arizo, within
                        actual possession of the United States, to prevent its falling into the
                        enemy’s hands, and by the Constitution of the United States compensation for
                        it was secured, and this only did the court decide.</p>
                    <p>But are we to be told that the Government of the United States is compelled
                        by its Constitution to pay its rebellious citizens for their <pb n="238"
                            xml:id="pg_238" facs="0294"/>property destroyed as a lawful, <hi
                            rend="italic">belligerent</hi> act? Has its Constitution thus tied its
                        hands as against a rebellion? Might the rebels, without liability, exercise
                        all recognized belligerent rights against it, including the capture of the
                        property of British subjects found in the loyal States, and yet it do the
                        like only subject to the duty of making compensation?</p>
                    <p>From all this absurdity there is no escape if the belligerent right of
                        capture and destruction shall be confounded with the sovereign right of
                        eminent domain. And indeed captures on the high seas must then go into the
                        same general category.</p>
                    <p>In fine, a constitutional provision—the condition of compensation for
                        property taken for public use—intended only to restrain civil
                        administration, would be held to so trammel belligerent rights in time of
                        civil war that effective hostilities against rebels might sometimes be
                        practically impossible.</p>
                    <p>Now, Congress saw that the full exercise of the belligerent right of capture
                        on land was, as to cotton especially, of the greatest military importance,
                        and that such capture would, therefore, be extensive, and that it would fall
                        alike on the loyal and the disloyal citizen, and also upon foreign residents
                        in the South who had not actually violated any duty. It was a generous
                        policy to mitigate calamities which a war thus lawfully conducted would
                        nevertheless impose upon persons guilty of no actual wrong. If the capture
                        was a lawful act of war, to restore a portion of the proceeds would been act
                        of grace and generosity constituting no foundation for a claim for more; and
                        if a particular mode was at the same time provided, whereby this partial
                        restitution might be sought, that mode only could be resorted to. The right
                        generously given and the mode of seeking it must go together.</p>
                    <p>The act concerning captured and abandoned property, allowing loyal persons to
                        recover in the Court of Claims, was just this act of grace. (Anderson’s
                        case, 9 Wall., 56.)</p>

                    <p>Again, it is a principle of international law established by the practice of
                        all civilized states, and sanctioned by every consideration of expediency
                        and justice, that where a nation has provided an adequate municipal remedy
                        by judicial proceedings for wrongs done by it to foreigners domiciled within
                        its jurisdiction, as well as to its own subjects, no international
                        reclamation can be made, at least until this municipal remedy has been
                        exhausted.</p>
                    <p>Upon this principle, also, this commission should make no award in this class
                        of cases. The Court of Claims was open to these claimants, with jurisdiction
                        to give them reasonable compensation for captures of cotton. There citizens
                        of the United States must go for relief within the time limited by act of
                        Congress; and I cannot assent to the proposition that domiciled aliens have
                        a better claim than citizens.</p>
                    <p>I would not be understood to hold that the right of capture of enemy’s
                        property on land, as recognized in recent times, is as broad as it is at
                        sea. The military reason for it must be more palpable and immediate. There
                        is a remote possibility that to take the lives of non-combatants—<pb n="239"
                            xml:id="pg_239" facs="0295"/>enemies—may weaken the enemy, for these
                        might be forced into the armies of the enemy; so, too, as to an <hi
                            rend="italic">indiscriminate</hi> capture or destruction of private
                        property. But all this is condemned by the modern law, and I would shudder
                        to countenance a revival of practices so horrible.</p>
                    <p>I admit, too, that there may be difficulty in defining the precise limits of
                        the right of capture on land. It cannot be doubted that it may be as broad
                        and general as the practice of the enemy in that regard: for retaliation is
                        fully justified by institutional writers, and by the practice of all
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>So I suppose it would not be questioned that arms, munitions of
                        war-commissary and quartermaster’s supplies, intended for sale to the enemy,
                        might be captured or destroyed. So, too, private manufactories intended to
                        furnish arms to be sold to the enemy, &amp;c., &amp;c. This enumeration
                        might be extended.</p>
                    <p>I feel safe in asserting that no nation in Christendom has practically
                        abandoned the right to capture and destroy in all such cases. It is a direct
                        blow at the military power of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>So if an enemy banker has engaged to supply the enemy government with money,
                        may not the cash in his vaults for that purpose be captured?</p>
                    <p>This, too, would be a <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> blow at the sinews of his
                        military power, quite as effective and not less humane than taking of life
                        in battle.</p>

                    <p>This is a claim for the destruction of 819 bales of cotton belonging to the
                        claimant by rebels in arms against the United States. The property was
                        destroyed in Louisiana and Mississippi in 1862 by the confederate forces
                        with the concurrence of the rebel authorities of Louisiana, one of the
                        Confederate States so called. Her Britannic Majesty had recognized the
                        so-called Confederate States as a belligerent and the contest of arms then
                        prevailing as a public war. After such recognition by the sovereign, the
                        subject of such sovereign cannot, in his character as such subject, aver
                        that the fact was not so. The act of his government in that regard is
                        conclusive upon him.</p>
                    <p>Aside from this recognition by Her Majesty, it is public history of which
                        this commission will take notice without averment or proof, that the
                        confederate forces were engaged at the time in a formidable rebellion
                        against the government of the United States. It may not be important to the
                        question in hand, therefore, that Her Majesty had taken the action already
                        stated.</p>
                    <p>It should be further observed that the particular “State of Louisiana” which
                        concurred and participated in the destruction of the claimant’s property was
                        a rebel organization, existing and acting as much in hostility to the
                        Government of the United States as was the Confederate States, so-called. It
                        was inform and fact a creature unknown to the Constitution of the United
                        States, and acting in hostility to it. It was an instrumentality of the
                        rebellion. Its agency, therefore, in the spoliation of this cotton cannot be
                        likened to the act of a State of the American <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240"
                            facs="0296"/>Union claiming to exist under the Constitution; and any
                        argument tending to show that under international law the national
                        government is liable to answer for wrongs committed by such a state upon the
                        subjects of a foreign power, can have no application to the matter now under
                        consideration. The question presented is simply whether the Government of
                        the United States is liable to answer to a neutral for the acts of those in
                        rebellion against it under the circumstances stated, who never succeeded in
                        establishing a government. It is not deemed necessary in this case to
                        inquire whether the claimant, having a commercial domicile in Louisiana at
                        the time, is to be deemed a British “subject of Her Britannic Majesty” in
                        the sense of Article XII of the treaty which creates this commission. That
                        question is argued by counsel, but it is thought better to meet the question
                        above stated for the reason that the case will thereby be determined more
                        distinctly upon its merits.</p>
                    <p>The statement of the question would seem to render it unnecesary to discuss
                        it. It is not the case of a government established <hi rend="italic">de
                            facto</hi>, displacing the government <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>.
                        But it is the case merely of an unsuccessful effort in that direction,
                        which, for the time being, interrupted the course of lawful government
                        without the fault of the latter.</p>
                    <p>Its acts were lawless and criminal, and could result in no liabilty on the
                        part of the Government of the United States.</p>

                        other government. The correspondence which led to the treaty clearly shows
                        that this means “<hi rend="italic">claims of</hi>” the citizens or subjects
                        of either government, against the other government. (Sir Edward Thornton to

                        international law is silent, giving no answer to this question. It is a

                        who is the individual “citizen or subject” in whose behalf a claim exists
                        after the death of the original claimant. If by the municipal law of the <hi

                            >nobody</hi> is entitled, then by this treaty we cannot make an

                            >individual</hi>, British or American, who has a claim. We have no
                        authority to create a claimant. The treaty <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have
                        provided for such cases, but it did not. It might have provided that proper
                        damages should be awarded against our government in favor of the other, for
                        the wrong to the nation, without reference to any question of the right of

                    <p>When the American rebellion began he was domiciled at Nassau, and so
                        continued until June 13, 1861, when he removed to New York, having made his
                        arrangements for that purpose the previous year, (his deposition, p.
                        37.)</p>
                    <p>The rebellion was not hatched in a corner. The firing upon Fort Sumter was
                        not a surprise. For many weeks prior thereto, it was known all over America
                        and Europe that elaborate preparations were being made for the attack. It
                        was virtually under siege for weeks before a gun was fired, its supplies cut
                        off, and fortifications for attack being built. This is public history. It
                        is not pretended that this was not known in Nassau. Arms of all kinds were
                        sought and in demand in the South. This claimant was at that time willing to
                        supply that demand, and for the sake of profit to put in Wilmington two
                        cannon which he owned, to be used to destroy the Government whose
                        hospitality he intended in a few weeks to accept. One of his explanations of
                        this is that, when so intending in April, 1861, he did not know that firing
                        upon Sumter had really yet begun! This was his statement to Consul
                        Archibald, (memorial, p. 17,) in September, 1861. It is possible that the
                        consul did not give his statement correctly. But in December, 1872, he
                        plainly means to be understood that at that time (April, 1861) he “got news”
                        for the first time that there was “<hi rend="italic">likely to be war</hi>,"
                        and therefore he did not send the guns to Wilmington! (his deposition, p.
                        48.) It overtaxes credulity to be expected to believe that an intelligent
                        merchant at Nassau did not learn, long before April, that there was “likely
                        to be a war.”</p>
                    <p>On September 2, 1861, the Government, being informed merely that he had
                        attempted to have the guns shipped from Nassau to Wilmington, and, so far as
                        we know, not learning that he was at the time a resident of Nassau, and that
                        it was probably before there was actual war, had him arrested. Learning the
                        facts as stated by the consul, he was promptly released after sixteen days’
                        detention.</p>
                    <p>The Government had learned enough to have made it almost criminal not to be
                        afterwards suspicious of Rahming. He had been willing to supply the rebels
                        with arms. He was trading ostensibly with Nassau, notoriously a mere
                        way-station for goods intended for the rebels. He had a trading-house there.
                        He was in business correspondence with, and sending goods to persons there
                        known to be in the confederate <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0298"
                        />trade. He was suspected and watched. It would have been wicked negligence
                        not to have watched him. Packages shipped by him were found on board a
                        confederate vessel captured in attempting to violate the blockade—the
                        “Margaret and Jessie.”</p>
                    <p>Domiciled now in New York, he could not lawfully aid the insurgents by
                        trading with them either directly or indirectly, even in the absence of a
                        blockade and an act of Congress prohibiting it. He was now in that respect
                        bound by all the duties incumbent on American citizens. He must restrain his

                    <p>Non-intercourse between belligerents rests upon a principle of public law,
                        and needed no act of Congress or public proclamation to establish it. Trade
                        with the enemy indirectly, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Nassau, was notless a
                        violation of this principle than <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> trade. If
                        there was probable cause to believe him guilty of this, his arrest was fully
                        warranted. If he so conducted his business as to create this belief, tempted
                        thereto by the hope of gain, he must submit to the consequences naturally
                        resulting from it. He had abundant notice that he was suspected, and this
                        should have put him on his guard.</p>
                    <p>December 31, 1863, he was again arrested, and was held six months and two
                        days. Was there probable cause for this arrest? It must not be forgotten
                        that it occurred immediately after the hearing and decree in the case of the
                        “Margaret and Jessie,” in which it appeared that cases shipped by Rahming
                        were on board, the marks unchanged, and that the Government acted and must
                        have acted upon what <hi rend="italic">then</hi> appeared not what <hi

                    <p>One might well inquire what more was needed to constitute probable cause for
                        his arrest.</p>
                    <p>Nor am I yet satisfied of his innocence. His own deposition, if fully
                        credited, ought perhaps to be deemed a sufficient explanation of nearly
                        everything. But I cannot accord full credit to his statements. He furnished
                        abundant reasons for (at least) caution in this respect. He made his
                        memorial under oath, stating when certain vessels were detained, to his
                        injury, viz, the Prince Alfred, in May, 1863, and the Star of the West, in
                        June. In his deposition he places the first event sixteen months earlier,
                        and the last eleven months earlier. The explanation is that these errors
                        must have been either <hi rend="italic">clerical</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >typographical</hi>. That they are not typographical appears by our
                        files. Then we have his positive and unnecessary affidavit in bankruptcy
                        that he is an American citizen, and his explanation that he did not read the
                        affidavit! The least that can reasonably be said of these explanations of
                        his is that he is not <hi rend="italic">careful</hi> as to <hi rend="italic"
                            >what</hi> he shall swear to| an oath being by him regarded as imposing
                        upon the conscience no obligation to know what it is that is affirmed. What
                        would become of the administration of justice if all men were thus
                        careless?</p>

                    <p>His explanation of the marks on cases found on board the Margaret and Jessie
                        leaves something more to be desired. It is not very probable that a
                        steamship running the blockade would be laden, to any extent, with <hi
                            rend="italic">empty</hi> barrels and boxes; and where merchants use old
                        cases in which to pack goods, they mark them <hi rend="italic">anew</hi>.
                        The old marks, it is true, sometimes remain legible, but the Margaret and
                        Jessie had on board several cases with only the marks of Rahming’s
                        consignees. It hardly explains this to say that his Nassau house was in the
                        habit of selling their <hi rend="italic">empty boxes for what they would
                            bring</hi>, unless we are also to suppose that when the same cases were
                        afterwards found in the confederate steamship they were empty!</p>
                    <p>In short, I am not sure that it was not to him a great favor that he was
                        discharged without a trial.</p>
                    <p>His complaints of harsh and inhuman treatment in prison, other than would
                        ordinarily attend secure imprisonment, are, I think, sufficiently met by the
                        evidence for the defense.</p>
                    <p>But I think that he was detained too long; that he was reasonably entitled to
                        either trial or discharge earlier.</p>

                    <p>Upon the question whether a claim can now be maintained before this
                        commission for vessels and cargoes, or either, captured and by the proper
                        courts of prize condemned as lawful prize, and no appeal prosecuted from the
                        judgment of such courts, there being nothing in the circumstances to hinder
                        or embarrass the claimant in prosecuting such appeal, I have reached a
                        conclusion in the negative. The reasons which have led me to this opinion I
                        put in writing for the consideration of my learned colleagues, with the
                        remark that, if I am wrong, I shall gladly yield whenever it is shown.</p>
                    <p>“Justice and equity" constitute the rule of our decision by the terms of the
                        treaty. This is the foundation of international law, and when that law
                        speaks upon a question, we must be guided by it; for both countries, as well
                        as the nations of Christendomr, ecognize its principles as equitable and
                        just; and we shall be wholly at sea with no guide, and disappoint both
                        governments, if we disregard it. If by the international law there is no
                        valid claim in such a case, then I know not how its validity can be
                        maintained. True, the treaty confers upon us <hi rend="italic"
                            >jurisdiction</hi> of such claims, because it refers them to this
                        commission. The question in hand is not of <hi rend="italic"
                            >jurisdiction</hi>, but it is whether the cases as stated in the several
                        memorials constitute claims which ought to be allowed. I do not doubt the
                        jurisdiction, but that does not determine their <hi rend="italic"
                            >validity</hi>. It only makes it our duty to decide whether they are
                        valid or not; and that decision should be according to the principles of
                        international law.</p>
                    <p>So far as I know, the approved writers upon international law are in accord
                        upon this question.</p>

                    <p>Opposed to this uniform and unbroken current of authority, English and
                        American, Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel cites only a single case, which it
                        is urged should outweigh all the text-writers. The case cited (bark
                        Jones—American and British commission under treaty of 1853, p. 83,) was not
                        a prize of war. It was a capture of a supposed slave-trader made under
                        British statutes. The capture was made at St. Helena, where there was a
                        court of record having jurisdiction, but the vessel was taken to Sierra
                        Leon, a distance of one thousand miles, for adjudication. She was acquitted
                        of the charge, and it was adjudged that there was <hi rend="italic">no
                            probable cause for seizure</hi>. But the court assessed her with costs
                        for “resistance of the master to fair inquiry"—a personal matter of which
                        the court had no cognizance under the statute. There was no appeal. These
                        are the circumstances under which Judge Upham was of opinion that the owner
                        was not bound to take an appeal. He seems to have deemed the judgment for
                        costs <hi rend="italic">coram non judice</hi> and utterly void. It further
                        appears that the master did not know where to follow his vessel, and was
                        deprived of all means of following it, (p. 101.) He did not appear in court.
                        How could he if such were the facts? Judge Upham, the American commissioner,
                        might well hold that under <hi rend="italic">such circumstances</hi> an
                        appeal <hi rend="italic">was not</hi> necessary to perfect the right of the
                        American Government to demand redress.</p>

                    <p>The opinion of Judge Upham seems to imply that in the absence of <hi
                            rend="italic">special circumstances</hi> an appeal would be
                        necesaary.</p>
                    <p>The opinion of Mr. Hornby, British commissioner, is silent upon the question
                        of appeal; and indeed it is difficult to see, from his opinion, (p. 107,)
                        upon what ground he could have consented to award any damages unless it was
                        that claimed by Judge Upham—that the court had no jurisdiction under the
                        statute to adjudge costs against the vessel for the alleged personal
                        misconduct of the master. He was willing to allow for detention of the
                        vessel and damages to her, and sacrifice on cargo.</p>
                    <p>The umpire expressed no opinion upon the question of appeal.</p>
                    <p>The case was peculiar, and I do not deem it an authority applicable to the
                        general question under consideration. General rules can never safely rest
                        upon the precedents of exceptional or hard cases. That there should be some
                        exceptions to the general rule as I deem it to be, I have no doubt. For
                        instance, if, as in the case of the Jones, an appeal was rendered very
                        difficult or impossible, or was embarrassed, by the act of the captors; or
                        if previous appeals in similar cases had shown that the appellate tribunal
                        of last resort did not govern itself by international law, thus indicating
                        that an appeal would have been useless, or if it had been waived by the
                        government of the captor, I would hesitate long before holding that appeal
                        was necessary to lay the foundation for an international claim.</p>
                    <p>But it is suggested that the text-writers cited are considering only the
                        grounds of war or reprisals, and not the causes adequate to justify a claim
                        for indemnity by one nation against another. I can only say that I think
                        this is a mistake. Besides, their reasoning, if correct, is absolutely
                        conclusive against both. If, as Rutherford asserts, “natural equity will not
                        allow that the state should be answerable," or “if the subjects of the
                        neutral state have no right to appeal to their own state for a remedy
                        against the erroneous sentence;” or if, according to Wheaton, “the neutral
                        has no ground of complaint,” and what he suffers is only “the inevitable
                        result of the belligerent right of capture;” or if, according to Wildman, a
                        failure to appeal is “an acknowledgment of the justice of the sentence;" or
                        if, according to Lawrence, “no claim can be made on the government of the
                        captor,” then I know not upon what ground it can be held that these claims
                        can be sustained upon the facts as alleged.</p>
                    <p>But reprisals are justified by the public law for refusal to repair an
                        injury, and when it is admitted that reprisals cannot be made, it is thereby
                        confessed that there is no just international demand.</p>
                    <p>Granted a just claim or injury recognized by the public law, then by that law
                        the state aggrieved is the exclusive judge of the mode of redress.</p>
                    <p>The note of Mr. Seward of December 22, 1862, concerning the case of the
                        Will-o’-the-Wisp, (No. 378, p. 30,) has been referred to.’ Was this either a
                        waiver of appeal in that case, or the expression of an opinion that an
                        appeal was not necessary? That note does not stand alone. The reply of Lord
                        Lyons (pp. 30, 31) seems to recognize that as a matter of right the United
                        States might stand on the absence of an appeal; but it makes an appeal to
                        the magnanimity of the American Government in the particular case. Mr.
                        Seward’s answer thereto of April 2, 1863, gives distinct notice that the
                        appeal is not waived, and that it is deemed necessary before the executive
                        government can be called upon to consider the subject.</p>

                        <item>In like manner the somewhat extended remarks of the general argument
                            to establish that <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> trade with the
                            Mexican port of Matamoras was not? a violation of the blockade, and

                            case. No such thing was ever, for a moment, pretended by the United
                            States. If, however it is intended to suggest the inference that damages
                            must be awarded for these captures because it was adjudged that these
                            vessels were in fact engaged in that <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>
                            trade, then I deny the inference. The reason is a good one for
                            discharging the vessel, but it has little to do with the question
                            whether damages should be given. That depends upon the inquiry, was
                            there good <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> cause for making the

                        <item>In view of the instructions to the blockading fleets, (satisfactory to
                            Lord Russell,) of the contemporaneous disavowals of Mr. Seward, and of
                            the uniform decisions of the American prize courts, there is no warrant
                            for the assumption (p. 21) that “these captures were intended to affect
                            the trade between Great Britain and Mexico."</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The doctrine that this commission may, by its decisions, disregard the
                            law of nations, in deference to whatever undefined notions of “equity
                            and justice” the several members of the commission may happen to
                            entertain from time to time, is to me a very great surprise. It brings
                            to mind the remark of an eminent English law judge, resisting the
                            establishment of the jurisdiction of the courts of equity in that
                            country, to the effect that decisions in equity depended upon the
                            individual conscience of whosoever happened to be chancellor, and were
                            therefore as uncertain as the length of the chancellor's arm or foot!
                            From such equity as that he might well have wished the deliverance of
                            his country. The injustice of his reproach is, however, seen in the fact
                            that “equity follows the law"—abides by it—not only obeys but maintains
                            it, and administers justice according to a system of known and
                            established principles sanctioned by precedent; that it does not depend
                            upon the individual conscience of the judge.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>What is the law of nations which it is insisted this commission may
                        disregard? All definitions of it are in accord, substantially, and none of
                        them better than Blackstone’s, “that which regulates the conduct and mutual
                        intercourse of independent states with each other by <hi rend="italic"
                            >reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> justice.” It is the
                        natural law applied to nations in their relations with each other, so far as
                        they have consented that it shall be thus applied. It is wanting in some of
                        the essentials of strict law, however 5 it is not prescribed by a common
                        superior, and its only sanction is the public opinion of Christendom. Nor is
                        it a complete code having an established rule for all questions that may
                        arise. It is <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0303"/>yet in the period of
                        its growth; but whenever it does speak it utters the rule which the wisdom
                        of the nations has by common consent found to be most in consonance with
                        reason and natural justice. When it gives a rule for the government of a
                        given case, it furnishes the full measure of international obligation in
                        that case—is the only standard by which conduct in that case can be properly
                        tested. In other words, it ascertains what is “equity and justice” between
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>If seeking to pay a compliment to the eminent men who negotiated the treaty,
                        I think one would hardly choose to say, “they authorized the mixed
                        commission at will to substitute for the rules of right which have been
                        sanctioned by all Christian powers and the courts of both countries the
                        individual notions of the Commissioners thereafter to be chosen.”</p>
                    <p>The application sought of the proposition alluded to is, in substance that,
                        though the facts before the prize-court fully justified its judgments,
                        according to the international law as even the British courts would
                        themselves declare it to-day, yet this commission may, upon some imaginary
                        ground of equity, be bound nevertheless to award damages!. I can only say
                        that no such result can occur here, except over the most emphatic and
                        decided dissent with which I can oppose it.</p>
                    <p>The Science (No. 391) was found at anchor in the roadstead outside the mouth
                        of the Rio Grande, within less than a marine league of the Texas shore,
                        which was blockaded. Her outward cargo, then discharged, had consisted in
                        part of confederate grey cloth, (290 bales.) She was, in fact, consigned to
                        Matamoras, and really had discharged her cargo there. Matamoras was forty
                        miles up the river. The Texas shore was accessible and less than two and a
                        half miles distant. Captured November 5, 1863; had been there since August
                        12.</p>
                    <p>The Dashing Wave (No. 395) was found at anchor near the Science, but further
                        within American waters. No part of her cargo was war material. There were,
                        however, two boxes (£12,000) of gold coin, £7,000 of which belonged to one
                        Caldwell, whose nationality was unknown, but it is evident he was not
                        British. It appeared from papers on board that at his request Lizardi &amp;
                        Co., British merchants, shipped it as theirs, the bill of lading (p. 193)
                        containing the unusual recital that it was “all British property.” She had
                        discharged no part of her cargo. Caldwell had requested this shipment to be
                        made by Lizardi &amp; Co., as their property, in their name, with £5,000 to
                        be advanced by them to him, if their consignee at Matamoras approved of
                        proposed investments of it. He had specially requested that it be insured,”
                        including the war risk," (p. 200.) She was, in fact, bound for
                        Matamoras.</p>
                    <p>Caldwell made no claim, but a claim was made on behalf of Lizardi &amp; Co.
                        for the whole £12,000, averring that "no other persons are interested
                        therein,” and sworn to by their attorney. Also, in the same behalf and to
                        the same broad extent, by Armando Brothers, to whom the consignee had
                        indorsed the bill of lading.</p>
                    <p>The Volant (No. 388) was captured in American waters, the same as the Science
                        and Dashing Wave, loaded by same brokers who loaded the Science, and had
                        confederate gray cloth, (15 bales,) being balance of invoice sent by
                        Science. The remainder of her cargo was blankets, shoes, and woolen
                        stockings, and brandy. She had not discharged her cargo. The invoice on
                        board described the cloth (p. 73) as four bales <hi rend="italic">blue
                            mixed</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">dark mixed</hi>, ten <hi rend="italic"
                            >sky blue</hi>. It seems that the whole was mixed, no <hi rend="italic"
                            >sky blue</hi> whatever. The manifest showed boots, but <hi
                            rend="italic">no shoes</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Sir William Peel (No. 243) was captured at the mouth of the Rio Grande,
                        in Mexican waters. She had been there about three months. <pb n="248"
                            xml:id="pg_248" facs="0304"/>Her cargo, as per manifest, had been mostly
                        discharged at Matamoras, and she had taken 904 bales of cotton, part of her
                        return cargo. She had two 25-pound guns mounted, considerable ammunition,
                        small arms, tomahawks, cutlasses, &amp;c., for boarding, engines six feet
                        below water line. Burden, 1,044 tons. Signal lights were on her at
                        night.</p>
                    <p>A confederate officer, it was sworn, claimed to have received arms from her,
                        landed on the coast of Texas at night; and this was not contradicted, though
                        there was opportunity. There is other strong inculpatory evidence, which is,
                        however, contradicted; tending to show both the inward and outward cargoes
                        to have been confederate property.</p>
                    <p>The question in all these cases Is, whether or not there was probable cause
                        for capture. The cargo of each of them was adapted to the Texan market; and
                        there is little doubt that it was expected ultimately to find sale there,
                        whether first to enter into the general stock of Matamoras, or merely to
                        observe the form of passing through that place in transit to Texas.</p>
                    <p>It seems from the evidence that merchandise unladen at the mouth of the Bio
                        Grande for Matamoras was conveyed to the latter place either in small
                        steamers by the river, or in wagons by land. It seems, also, that this land
                        transportation by wagons was likewise practicable on the Texas side from the
                        coast at the mouth of the river.</p>
                    <p>It was a matter of notoriety that enormous supplies of military as well as
                        other goods for consumption in the confederacy had been introduced through
                        Texas <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>, until the blockade of that coast was
                        made effective, and afterwards through Matamoras. It was equally notorious
                        that there was in Texas a great demand for such goods when these vessels
                        were seized; and that it was the policy of the rebel authorities to ship
                        cotton abroad rather than sell it at home.</p>
                    <p>These considerations are mentioned to show the strong temptations which
                        existed to introduce goods, and especially arms and ammunition, (which could
                        not go through Matamoras,) into Texas direct. And if accomplished it would
                        avoid Mexican custom-house scrutiny, duties, charges and detentions, and all
                        the inconveniences which flow from circuitous and indirect methods.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as watchful Federal cruisers were present almost constantly any
                        attempt by day to put goods upon the Texas shore would have been too
                        hazardous for probable success. If done at all, it must have been under
                        cover of darkness, and in small quantities at a time, and by the use of
                        small boats. This would consume time, and would be greatly facilitated by
                        nearness of the ship to the Texas shore.</p>
                    <p>“The Science.” The foregoing observations apply in all these cases. With a
                        burden of only 300 tons, the length of her visit (nearly three months) was
                        of itself remarkable. She had the strong temptation to violate the blockade,
                        and she had placed herself so near the Texas shore that she had the
                        opportunity to do it. These circumstances of suspicion she created, and did
                        not explain. If a ship may thus put herself so near a blockaded shore for
                        months, where, under cover of the night, she can land her cargo upon it, and
                        this without any peril or cause of suspicion, then, indeed, the right of
                        blockade is less valuable to a belligerent than I believe it to be.</p>
                    <p>I am thus led to the conclusion, not merely that the judgment of the Supreme
                        Court in the case of the Science was not clearly wrong, but that that
                        judgment was clearly right.</p>
                    <p>“The Dashing Wave.” The foregoing remarks apply with equal force to the case
                        of the Dashing Wave, except that she had but recently arrived at the place
                        where she was seized; and in this case there is superadded <pb n="249"
                            xml:id="pg_249" facs="0305"/>the facts concerning the coin of Caldwell.
                        A Mexican would have no occasion thus to conceal his ownership. A Mexican
                        would not have feared to make claim in the prize court. He was either
                        Mexican or confederate, for his country had political troubles. The
                        conclusion is difficult to avoid that he was an enemy, and his property
                        liable to capture, contaminating all that belonged really to Lizardi &amp;
                        Co.</p>
                    <p>I perceive no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court in this case, except
                        in its failure to condemn the coin as lawful prize.</p>
                    <p>“The Volant” is a case much like the Dashing Wave. There was no simulated
                        ownership of cargo, but there was an apparent effort to mislead by the
                        invoice, as to the cloth—to conceal the fact that it was confederate
                        gray.</p>
                    <p>I see no sufficient reason to hold in this that the judgment of the Supreme
                        Court was wrong.</p>
                    <p>“The Sir William Peel” differs from the other cases in the fact that she was
                        captured in Mexican waters, where she had a right to be; though it seems
                        from the evidence that she had previously been in Texan waters. In all other
                        respects the case is stronger against the ship than in either of the others.
                        It is only by giving her the benefit of doubts that I can say she should not
                        have been condemned. I am very clearly of opinion that there was abundant
                        reason for seizing her and sending her in for adjudication.</p>
                    <p>That she was taken in Mexican waters was a violation of the sovereignty of
                        Mexico, but not of the rights of the ship and cargo, which could be
                        interposed for their protection except by Mexico, was the doctrine held by
                        the Supreme Court. I think the proposition is fully supported by reason and
                        the principles of justice; and that it is a sound principle of international
                        law, best in accord with the adjudged cases.</p>
                    <p>On the question of the assessment of damages in the case of the Sir William
                        Peel, Mr. Commissioner Frazer delivered the following dissenting
                        opinion:</p>
                    <p>Concerning the assessment of damages in the case of the Sir William Peel,
                        (the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States being deemed
                        erroneous by my colleagues,) I felt constrained to dissent upon an important
                        point.</p>
                    <p>The ship, and nearly all the cargo, having been restored, it was material to
                        ascertain the value of the property so restored at the date of restitution.
                        If it was then worth as much as when captured, the only legitimate damages,
                        it seemed to me, would beits use during the period of detention, together
                        with costs and expenses. The value, I thought, should be taken at the time
                        and place of restitution, and not at a different time. It had been
                        ascertained at that time by an appraisement by the prize court, one of the
                        appraisers being an agent of the claimants. This appraisement was in round
                        numbers, in gold, £67,500. But the claimants chose, at very great expense,
                        to take the property to England, where they sold it, realizing only £39,600;
                        from which has been deducted all expenses of removal to England, insurance,
                        and other expenses of its preservation and care after restitution, (a very
                        considerable aggregate,) and these net proceeds, deducted from the value at
                        the time of capture, have been taken as a part of the damages awarded. I
                        could not resist the conclusion that the claimants had, after restitution,
                        sacrificed the property for but little more than half its value; and I could
                        not agree that the United States should suffer that loss. It constitutes
                        about three-fourths of the large sum awarded in the case.</p>

                    <p>The only lawful object of a blockade is to injure the enemy. Hence there
                        cannot, consistently with public law, be a blockade of a port unless it be
                        an enemy’s port.</p>
                    <p>But I am not prepared say that the mere occupancy of a port, however
                        precarious and temporary, by the belligerent maintaining the blockade
                        thereof, is such a possession as makes the port no longer the enemy’s, but
                        that of the blockading belligerent, thereby terminating the blockade. I know
                        of no authority which goes to that extent. In such a case I think the
                        question must be regarded as one of first impression, open to the just
                        influence of every consideration which should affect the decision of a new
                        question.</p>
                    <p>But I do not think this question is necessarily involved in the decision of
                        the cases growing out of the capture and condemnation of the Circassian, and
                        therefore I do not discuss it.</p>
                    <p>There has been much criticism of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
                        case of the Circassian, (2 Wall., 135.) That judgment has been questioned in
                        quarters entitled to great respect; and it has, on such occasions,
                        uniformly, I believe, been assumed that at the date of the capture of the
                        vessel, (May 4, 1862,) the port of New Orleans was in the possession of the
                        United States, a possession which subsequent events-proved to be (whatever
                        may have been apprehended at the time) permanent and uninterrupted. And it
                        has been assumed that the Supreme Court held that, under such circumstances,
                        the blockade of the port was not brought to an end, This is a grave
                        misapprehension, not only of historical facts but of the doctrine announced
                        by the Supreme Court; and yet so easy to fall into, that only by care can it
                        be avoided. It is undoubtedly a fact of history that for several days prior
                        to the capture at sea, of this ship, the military forces of the United
                        States had actual possession of the city of New Orleans, were not there
                        immediately menaced by any hostile force, and ever after held it. It is so
                        natural to confound the city with the port of New Orleans that the error is
                        not wonderful. And yet the distinction is very wide, and practically very
                        important.</p>
                    <p>The city of New Orleans, of which the United States held possession, was a
                        municipal corporation, possessing geographical boundaries defined by the
                        laws of the State of Louisiana, The boundaries included, at the utmost, only
                        so much of that larger territory called the parish of Orleans as lies on the
                        left bank of the Mississippi River. But the National Government, having by
                        the Constitution the control of commerce, and consequently the power to
                        define the geographical limits of the ports of the United States, had, by
                        act of Congress taking effect September 16, 1850, declared “that the port of
                        New Orleans shall be and is hereby so extended as to embrace the whole
                        parish of New Orleans, on both sides of the Mississippi River.” (9 Stat, at
                        L., 458.) It was not the city merely, but the whole port which had been
                        blockaded. And the question before the Supreme Court was not whether the
                        possession of a port by a blockading belligerent puts an end to the
                        blockade. It is a disregard of the facts so to state it, and it is a
                        misapprehension of the decision of the court to suppose that it was reached
                        by determining that question in the negative. The real question was deemed
                        by the majority of the court to be whether possession of the <hi
                            rend="italic">city</hi> by the United States terminated its blockade <pb
                            n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0307"/>of the <hi rend="italic">port</hi>
                        It needs only a careful reading of the opinion of the Chief Justice to see
                        that he saw clearly the difference between the city and the port of New
                        Orleans; and an examination of the dissenting opinion of Judge Nelson will
                        also show that he entirely confounded the city with the port.</p>
                    <p>Is it possible to misunderstand the following language found in the opinion
                        of the Chief Justice?</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It (the blockade) applied not to the city alone, but controlled the port
                            which includes the whole parish of Orleans and lies on both sides of the
                            Mississippi, and all the ports on that river and on the lakes east of
                            the city. Now, it may be well enough conceded that a continuous and
                            complete possession of the city <hi rend="italic">and the port</hi> and
                            of the approaches from the Gulf, would make a blockade unnecessary, and
                            would supersede it. But at the time of the capture of the Circassian
                            there was <hi rend="italic">no such possession</hi>. Only the <hi
                                rend="italic">city</hi> was occupied, <hi rend="italic">not the
                                port.</hi></p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Nothing can be more certain than that the Chief Justice <hi rend="italic"
                            >thought</hi> there-was an important and very practical distinction
                        between the city and the port of New Orleans with reference to the question
                        of blockade. If not, then this language, marking so clearly the difference
                        between the two things, and dwelling upon the fact that though the city was
                        occupied by the Federal forces, a very large part of the port was not so
                        occupied, was idle verbiage, injected into the opinion for no purpose unless
                        it may have been to increase its volume!</p>
                    <p>I think the Chief Justice was correct in supposing that the
                        difference-between the city and the port was of practical importance in the
                        case. A little consideration will make this quite apparent.</p>
                    <p>No rebel military force, it is true, occupied that part of the port (the
                        right bank of the river, many miles in length) which was not occupied by the
                        United States on the 4th May, 1862; but it was, <hi rend="italic">de
                            facto</hi>, territory of the rebel belligerent, nevertheless. Trade
                        there was trade with the enemy, to prevent which is the lawful purpose of
                        blockade. It is not necessary to the lawful blockade of an enemy’s port that
                        the enemy should hold it by the presence of a military force. Suppose, then,
                        that on the 4th May, 1862, the Circassian had steamed into the port with a
                        view to discharge her cargo at any landing on the right bank of the river,
                        within the port, rebel merchants, non-combatants, being ready to receive it
                        there and transport it into the interior, no portion of the goods being
                        contraband, by what right, save that of blockade, could the Federal fleet
                        have interfered to prevent it? The position and strength of that fleet, it
                        is true, enabled it to capture, without fail, every vessel which might have
                        attemped such a thing; but this physical ability to capture did not, <hi
                            rend="italic">per se</hi>, confer the right to exercise it; nor did it,
                            <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, end the blockade. It is said that a
                        municipal regulation might have been enacted prohibiting such importations
                        or controlling them; and in execution of such an enactment the force at hand
                        could have been employed; but this is no relief from the dilemma. The right
                        by municipal regulations to close rebel ports and render trade-with them
                        unlawful, was claimed by the United States very early in the rebellion. It
                        was proposed, but the right to do so was denied by Great Britain and other
                        neutral nations, and its exercise was forborne-in deference to their
                        protests. Even in the argument for the claimant in these cases, the right of
                        the United States to exercise sovereign rights (and belligerent rights at
                        the same time) against the rebels to the prejudice of neutrals, is earnestly
                        combatted by a gentleman who, as a writer upon public law, stands deservedly
                        high as an authority, and who, in his published works, had before expressed
                        the same opinion. Whatever <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0308"/>maybe
                        true as to that, it is very certain that Great Britain, having contributed
                        more than any other nation to induce the United States to forbear, by
                        denying the right, cannot now fairly claim for her subjects the benefit of a
                        principle which, at the time, she so stoutly denied. Municipal regulations
                        prohibiting neutral import trade with any part of the port of New Orleans
                        not in Federal possession, would have been as obnoxious to Great Britain as
                        if a like attempt had been made at that time concerning Mobile, Charleston,
                        or Savannah. The principle which would have justified it in the one case,
                        would have maintained it in all.</p>
                    <p>If the consideration of the case left it doubtful whether the judgment of the
                        Supreme Court was in accordance with public law, it would be our plain duty,
                        according to all authority, to disallow these claims. So much deference in a
                        case of doubt is due to a deliberate judgment of a court whose independence,
                        impartiality, and learning has given it a character in Great Britain not
                        less lofty than it possesses at home.</p>
                    <p>But I do not doubt. Comments and criticisms upon the judgment of the court
                        had fallen under my eye; trusting to which, I confess I had been somewhat
                        impressed with serious doubts (to say the least) of the legality of the
                        condemnation. But a very careful study of the case shows that, in making
                        such criticisms, no account has been taken of the important fact that the
                        possession of the United States forces at New Orleans did not extend to the
                        whole port when the ship was seized; no such entire possession being
                        anywhere directly asserted. That the error is one of inference, resulting
                        from the fact, doubtless, that the wider area of the port, as
                        contradistinguished from the city of the same name, has usually escaped
                        attention. It follows, therefore, that the principle supposed to be violated
                        by the court was really not violated at all, and that the question was not
                        that which has been sometimes supposed. It is not, I may hope, improper to
                        say that the best care and judgment which I am able to bring to the
                        consideration of the case has resulted in a clear conviction that the
                        condemnation of the Circassian was correct.</p>

                    <p>The allowance of prospective earnings by vessels was denied by the tribunal
                        at Geneva <hi rend="italic">unanimously</hi>. It is not, so far as I am
                        aware, allowed by the municipal law of any civilized nation anywhere. The
                        reason is obvious and universally recognized among jurists. It is not
                        possible to ascertain such earnings with any approximation to certainty.
                        There are a thousand unknown contingencies, the happening of any of which
                        will render incorrect any estimate of them, and hence result in
                        injustice.</p>
                    <p>Who can say that the Monmouth would have reached Savannah at all? That she
                        could have procured a cargo of cotton at ¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per
                        pound, the lowest freight in proof? Who can say that she would have got
                        better or as good rates as that? Why could she have done better? There is no
                        reason. Who can say that she could have been laden and sailed before the
                        blockade would have stopped her? The witnesses do <pb n="253"
                            xml:id="pg_253" facs="0309"/>not say so, but only “if she had met no
                        detention or accident.” Can this commission say so? It is palpable that we
                        can only conjecture, and conjecture is no fit basis for an award of damages.
                        We should have had evidence more satisfactory from the claimant, such as the
                        prevailing rate of charter of such a vessel at the time and place. Under
                        such circumstances we are left to estimate the value of the vessel for
                        return-cargo upon very unsatisfactory evidence. I base my estimate upon
                        cotton-freight at ¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, because there is, in
                        my judgment, a greater probability, in view of all contingencies, that this
                        is above rather than below a just estimate.</p>
                    <p>These observations apply also to the case of the Boyne, heretofore decided. I
                        now doubt whether this is not too much. It assumes that each contingency
                        would have been avoided, the happening of any one of which would have
                        prevented this vessel from doing as well as some others; and this assumption
                        in favor of the claimant is quite as much as, in my judgment, we may make,
                        with due regard to public law, as declared at Geneva, and to the principles
                        of justice, as recognized everywhere.</p>
                    <p>The Monmouth, (No. 315.), The President, by proclamation of April 19, 1861,
                        gave public notice of a purpose to blockade the ports of South Carolina,
                        Georgia, and of the States south thereof, announcing that a “competent force
                            <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be posted" for that purpose. The
                        proclamation announced further that any vessel approaching or attempting to
                        leave “either of said ports” with a view to violate “such blockade,” would
                        be warned by the commander of “one of the blockading vessels,” who would
                        indorse such warning and the date thereof on her register, and any
                        subsequent attempt of the same vessel to enter or leave “<hi rend="italic"
                            >the blockaded port</hi>” (certainly meaning every port covered by the
                        warning) would result in capture. It cannot be supposed that it was intended
                        that this warning was to be repeated off each port blockaded.</p>
                    <p>In these cases the warning was by a vessel blockading Charleston and off that
                        port <hi rend="italic">before</hi> there was any actual blockading force off
                        Savannah, and was indorsed thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Boarded, informed of the blockade, and warned off the coast of all
                                the Southern States by the United States steamship Niagara, May 12,
                                1861.</p>
                            <p rend="right">EDWARD C. POTTER,<lb/><hi rend="italic">Lieutenant
                                    United States Navy.</hi></p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>This warning was not, and is not, disavowed. It must, therefore, have the
                        same effect as if the officer giving it had been expressly instructed by the
                        highest authority to give it in that form. It must be regarded as the act of
                        the United States, and was notice to the vessel that all the Southern ports
                        embraced within the proclamation were then actually blockaded, and that any
                        subsequent attempt of the vessel warned to enter any of such ports would
                        result in capture.</p>
                    <p>A vessel bound for Savannah, thus warned, it is true, might have disregarded
                        the warning, and could lawfully have proceeded to Savannah because there was
                        not, in fact, any force blockading that port. If captured she would,
                        unquestionably, have been discharged with damages by the prize court.</p>
                    <p>But must the neutral merchantman run the hazard of attempting to enter
                        Savannah? Had she found there an actual blockade and been captured, her
                        previous warning would have been good, and her condemnation as good prize
                        would have been certain. There is in the facts every element of a strong
                        obligation upon the United States, and in favor of a vessel which, on the
                        faith of the warning given, fully respected <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254"
                            facs="0310"/>it, and by so doing suffered loss, to make good that loss.
                        The neutral vessel, ignorant as to the facts, had a right to act upon the
                        warning; and I am compelled to hold that, in doing so, she acted with all
                        prudence and propriety, and that, judging, as her captors must at the time,
                        any other course would have been rashness and folly. A regard for the
                        interests of his owners, as well as respect for the United States, required
                        that the master should abandon any purpose to enter Savannah.</p>
                    <p>These observations apply also to Nos. 216 and 467.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with an instruction
                                which I have received from Earl Granville, I have the honor to state
                                that her Majesty’s government deem it of importance to the good
                                relations which they are ever anxious should subsist and be
                                strengthened between the United States and Great Britain, that a
                                friendly and complete understanding should be come to between the
                                two governments as to the extent of the rights which belong to the
                                citizens of the United States and Her Majesty’s subjects,
                                respectively, with reference to the fisheries on the coasts of Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America, and as to any other
                                questions between them which affect the relations of the United
                                States toward those possessions.</p>
                            <p>As the consideration of these matters would, however, involve
                                investigations of a somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very
                                desirable that they should be thoroughly examined, I am directed by
                                Lord Granville to propose to the Government of the United States the
                                appointment of a joint high commission, which shall be composed of
                                members to be named by each government; shall hold its sessions at
                                Washington; and shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the
                                different questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well
                                as all those which affect the relations of the United States toward
                                Her Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I am confident that this proposal will be met by your Government in
                                the same cordial spirit of friendship which has induced Her
                                Majesty’s government to tender it, and I cannot doubt that in that
                                case the result will not fail to contribute to the maintenance of
                                the good relations between the two countries which I am convinced
                                the Government of the United States, as well as that of Her Majesty,
                                equally have at heart.</p>

                                most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                                compliance with instructions from Earl Granville, that Her Majesty’s
                                government deem it of importance to the good relations which they
                                are ever anxious should subsist and be strengthened between the

                                the rights which belong to the citizens of the United States and Her
                                Majesty’s subjects, respectively, with reference to the fisheries on
                                the coast of Her Majesty’s possessions in North America, and as to
                                any other questions between them which affect the relations of the
                                United States toward those possessions; and, further, that as the
                                consideration of these questions would involve investigations of a
                                somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very desirable that they
                                should be thoroughly examined, you are directed by Lord Granville to
                                propose to the Government of the United States the appointment of a
                                joint high commission, which shall be composed of members to be
                                named by each government; shall hold its sessions at Washington; and
                                shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the different
                                questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well as all
                                those which affect the relations of the United States toward Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I have laid your note before the President, who instructs me to say
                                that he shares with Her Majesty’s government the appreciation of the
                                importance of a friendly and complete understanding between the two
                                governments with reference to the subjects specially suggested for
                                the consideration of the proposed joint high commission, and he
                                fully recognizes the friendly spirit which has prompted the
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>The President is, however, of the opinion that without the adjustment
                                of a class of questions not alluded to in your note, the proposed
                                high commission would fail to establish the permanent relations and
                                the sincere, substantial, and lasting friendship between the two
                                governments which, in common with Her Majesty’s government, he
                                desires should prevail.</p>
                            <p>He thinks that the removal of the differences which arose during the
                                rebellion in the United States, and which have existed since then,
                                growing out of the acts committed by the several vessels which have
                                given rise to the claims generically known as the “Alabama” claims,
                                will also be essential to the restoration of cordial and amicable
                                relations between the two governments. He directs me to say that,
                                should Her Majesty’s government accept this view of this matter, and
                                assent that this subject also may be treated of by the proposed high
                                commission, and may thus be put in the way of a final and amicable
                                settlement, this Government will, with much pleasure, appoint high
                                commissioners on the part of the United States, to meet those who
                                may be appointed on behalf of Her Majesty’s government, and will
                                spare no efforts to secure, at the earliest practicable moment, a
                                just and amicable arrangement of all the questions which now
                                unfortunately stand in the way of an entire and abiding friendship
                                between the two nations.</p>

                                during the rebellion in the United States, and which have existed

                                expressed by the President of the United States, the friendliness of
                                which, I beg you to believe, I fully appreciate.</p>
                            <p>I am now authorized by his lordship to state that it would give Her
                                Majesty’s government great satisfaction if the claims commonly known
                                by the name of the “Alabama" claims were submitted to the
                                consideration of the same high commission by which Her Majesty’s
                                government have proposed that the questions relating to the British
                                possessions in North America should be discussed, provided that all
                                other claims, both of British subjects and citizens of the United
                                States, arising out of acts committed during the recent civil war in
                                this country, are similarly referred to the same commission. The
                                expressions made use of in the name of the President in your
                                above-mentioned note with regard to the “Alabama” claims convince me
                                that the Government of the United States will consider it of
                                importance that these causes of dispute between the two countries
                                should also, and at the same time, be done away with, and that you
                                will enable me to convey to my government the assent of the
                                President to the addition which they thus propose to the duties of
                                the high commission, and which cannot fail to make it more certain
                                that its labors will lead to the removal of all differences between
                                the two countries.</p>

                                express the satisfaction with which he has received the intelligence
                                that Earl Granville has authorized you to state that Her Majesty’s
                                govern-nent has accepted the views of this Government as to the
                                disposition to be made of the so-called “Alabama claims.”</p>
                            <p>He also directs me to say with reference to the remainder of your
                                note, <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0324"/>that if there be
                                other and further claims of British subjects, or of American
                                citizens, growing out of acts committed during the recent civil war
                                in this country, he assents to the propriety of their reference to
                                the same high commission; but he suggests that the high
                                commissioners shall consider only such claims of this description as
                                may be presented by the governments of the respective claimants at
                                an early day, to be agreed upon by the commissioners.</p>

                                the Federal Government has given you of the questions to be
                                discussed and treated by the joint commission, of which you have
                                been appointed a member, seem to render unnecessary any instructions
                                upon the questions that will come under the consideration of that

                            <p>It is hoped that this memorandum, which has been prepared in this
                                Department, may aid you by its references in the consideration of
                                the several questions on which it treats.</p>
                            <p>The President commits the discussion and treatment of the several
                                questions to the joint discretion of yourself and your
                                associates.</p>
                            <p>The sittings of the commission being in this city, you will have the
                                opportunity, of which he expects you to avail yourself, of
                                consulting with him from time to time, and upon any points in which
                                you may have serious doubts, and you can also cautiously and
                                confidentially ascertain the views and opinions of Senators, to
                                whom, in case your negotiations shall result in a treaty or
                                convention, that result must be submitted for their constitutional
                                advice and consent.</p>
                            <p>One point not referred to in the accompanying memorandum will,
                                probably be brought to the consideration of the Joint Commission,
                                viz: Some agreement between the two Governments defining their
                                respective rights and duties as neutrals in case the other
                                Government be engaged in war with a third power.</p>
                            <p>It is enough that the subject be indicated and your attention to it
                                asked as one of the important questions that may engage the
                                considerations of the commission.</p>

                            <p>The President hopes that whatever principles may be established or
                                recognized in connection with this subject shall be considered
                                equally applicable to the period covered by the late civil war in
                                this country and the future.</p>

                                <item>Prior to the negotiation of the treaty of 1818, France had

                                        mackerel-fisheries. The cod are usually split and dried on

                            are pursued chiefly for mackerel and herring—constitute the smaller
                            portion; probably not more than one-fourth of the whole.”</p>

                            American fishing-vessels engaged in the deep-sea fisheries off the
                            coasts of the British North American provinces is, as near as can be
                            estimated, about 1,400, with an aggregate tonnage of nearly 100,000
                            tons, employing about 17,000 men. They pursue the fisheries on the banks
                            of Newfoundland, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and on the western
                            banks. On the banks the fisheries are pursued for cod and halibut, and
                            in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence principally for mackerel. The capital
                            employed in these fisheries is estimated at between eight and nine
                            millions. The aggregate annual yield is about seven millions of dollars.
                            The deep-sea fisheries are exclusive of the <hi rend="italic"

                            the in-shore fisheries were pursued by our fishermen chiefly for
                            mackerel. <hi rend="italic">The quantity so taken, however, did not
                                exceed, on an average, in any one year, more than one-fourth of the

                            discussed by the commissioners for negotiating the treaty of peace that
                            closed the war of 1812. The United States commissioners claimed that the
                            treaty of 1783 conferred no new rights upon the United States; that it
                            was an agreement as to a division of property which took place on the
                            division of the British empire after the success of the American
                            Revolution, and was not in that respect abrogated by war. The British
                            commissioners, on the other hand, held that, while the treaty of 1783

                                <p>The liberty of taking fish within rivers is not asked. A positive
                                    clause to except them is unnecessary, unless it be intended to

                                    wanted for carrying on the fishery should be found on board, are
                                    of that description, and would expose the fishermen to endless

                            with the article submitted by the American commissioners, on the 17th of
                            September, shows that the only material change made, so far as the
                            present discussion is concerned, was in the exclusion of the word “<hi
                                rend="italic">bait</hi>.” It is represented that the “bait” referred
                            to in the treaty must have been bait for "<hi rend="italic">cod</hi>,
                            which were caught in those waters, as the mackerel-fisheries in those
                            waters did not begin till several years after that time. It was,
                            therefore, within the letter and spirit of the convention to deny to
                            American fishermen the right to <hi rend="italic">catch</hi> that bait
                            in those waters. The favorite bait for the mackerel is said to be caught
                            only off the coast of Maine, and not to be found in Canadian waters. If
                            this is correct, it could not have been intended to deny to our
                            fishermen the right to <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> that bait in
                            British ports.</p>

                        <p>It does not appear that there was any further correspondence about this

                            (from Mr. Vaughn to Mr Clay) does not appear to have been ever answered.
                            From that time until 1836 there is no evidence of complaint on the files

                        <p><seg type="margin">1836.</seg> In this year the statute of Nova Scotia
                            was passed, authorizing officers to go on board vessels hovering within

                            vessel to depart; to bring it into port if it did not do so within

                            up in a report from” the acting Secretary of State, Mr. Vail, (<hi

                            98.) Mr. Vail “is unable to state whether, in the cases under

                            think that most of the cases were connected with alleged violations of
                            the customs laws. Lieutenant Paine reports that “the authorities of Nova

                            their ports unless in actual distress, and American vessels are
                            accordingly warned to depart or ordered to get under way and leave a
                            harbor whenever the provincial customhouse or British naval officer
                            supposes, without a full examination “of the circumstances under which
                            they entered, that they have been there a reasonable time,” and
                            instructed him to “immediately remonstrate against the illegal and
                            vexatious proceedings of the authorities of Nova Scotia toward our

                            Majesty’s government to remedy the evils arising out of this
                            misconstruction on the part of the provincial authorities of their
                            conventional obligations.” He also gave strong and explicit instructions
                            as to the Nova Scotia act of 1836. (<hi rend="italic">Ib., pages</hi>

                        <p>The reasoning of Mr. Forsyth, on pages 107 and 108, upon the Nova Scotia

                        <p><seg type="margin">Mar. 27.</seg> Mr. Stevenson brought to Lord

                            waters “within three miles of a line drawn from headland to headland,
                            instead of from the indents of the shores of the provinces.” 2. That the
                            authorities of Nova Scotia had “put upon the stipulations of the treaty
                            [as to the entry to harbors, &amp;c.] a construction directly in
                            conflict with their object, and entirely subversive of the rights and
                            interests of the citizens of the United States.” 3. The objectionable
                            law of Nova Scotia. 4. The assertion, said to be untenable, “that the
                            Gut of Can so is a narrow strip of water completely within and dividing

                            in the convention. No such word is there found. 2. Giving an answer as
                            to the use of ports, which is immaterial in the present aspect, but
                            which was favorable to the American fishermen so far as it went. 3. Say
                            nothing about the objectionable clauses in the law. 4. Affirming the
                            colonial doctrine about the Gut of Canso. (<hi rend="italic">Sabine

                                    entering the bays or harbors of the British provinces, except
                                    for the purpose of shelter, repairing damages, and obtaining
                                    wood and water. A bay, as is usually understood, is an arm or
                                    recess of the sea entering from the ocean between capes and
                                    headlands, and the term is applied equally to small and large
                                    tracts of water thus situated; it is common to speak of Hudson’s
                                    Bay, or the Bay of Biscay, although they are very large tracts

                                    fishermen who may follow their pursuits inside of that line. It
                                    was undoubtedly an oversight in the convention of 1818 to make
                                    so large a concession to England, since the United States has
                                    usually considered that those vast inlets or recesses ought to
                                    be opened to American fishermen as freely as the sea itself to

                                    headlands, there appears no doubt that the Washington, in
                                    fishing ten miles from the shore, violated no stipulations of
                                    the treaty.</p>
                                <p>It was urged, on behalf of the British government, that by
                                    coasts, bays, &amp;c., is understood an imaginary line, drawn
                                    along the coast from headland to headland, and that the
                                    jurisdiction of Her Majesty extends three marine miles outside
                                    of this line; thus closing all the bays on the coast or shore,
                                    and that great body of water called the Bay of Fundy, against
                                    Americans and others, making the latter a British bay. This
                                    doctrine of headlands is new, and has received a proper limit in
                                    the convention between France and Great Britain of 2d August,
                                    1839, in which “it is agreed that the distance of three miles
                                    fixed as the general limit for the exclusive right of fishery
                                    upon the coasts of the two countries shall, with respect to
                                    bays, the mouths of which do not exceed ten miles in width, be
                                    measured from a straight line drawn from headland to
                                    headland.”</p>
                                <p>The Bay of Fundy is from 65 to 75 miles wide and 130 to 140 miles
                                    long; it has several bays on its coasts; thus the word bay, as
                                    applied to this great body of water, has the same meaning as
                                    that applied to the Bay of Biscay, the Bay of Bengal, over which
                                    no nation can have the right to assume the sovereignty. One of
                                    the headlands of the Bay of Fundy is in the United States, and
                                    ships bound to Passamaquoddy must sail through a large space of
                                    it. The islands of Grand Menan (British) and Little Menan
                                    (American) are situated nearly on a line from headland to
                                    headland. These islands, as represented in all geographies, are
                                    situate in the Atlantic Ocean. The conclusion is, therefore, in
                                    my mind irresistible that the Bay of Fundy is not a British bay,
                                    nor a bay within the meaning of the word, as used in the

                            the system of licensing American fishermen to fish in the in-shore
                            fisheries. The number of licenses taken out the first year is reported
                            to have been 354. (<hi rend="italic">Review of Presidents message,

                            said that that statute was a “violation of well-established principles

                            and of all civilized nations, and seemed to be expressly designed to
                            enable Her Majesty’s authorities, with perfect impunity, to seize and
                            confiscate American vessels, and to embezzle, almost indiscriminately,
                            the property of our citizens employed in the fisheries on the coasts of
                            the British possessions.” Mr. Everett stigmatized it as “possessing none
                            of the qualities of the law of civilized states but its forms.” And

                        <p>The President states in his Annual Message (December, 1870) that this
                            river constitutes a material outlet to the ocean for eight States, with
                            an aggregate population of about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with an
                            aggregate tonnage of 661,367 tons upon the waters which discharge into
                            it.</p>
                        <p>During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay demonstrated
                            the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation
                            of this river, claiming that the act of the congress of Vienna, in
                            opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgment
                            of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country
                            through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the
                            navigation of that river to and into the sea, even though passing
                            through the territories of another power. This right does not exclude
                            the co-equal right of the sovereign possessing the territory through
                            which the river debouches into the sea to make such regulations relative
                            to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary but those
                            regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should
                            not impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right of
                            transit. (6 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations, folio pages</hi> 757
                                <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 777.)</p>
                        <p>If the claim made by Mr. Clay was just when the population of States
                            bordering on the shores of the lakes was only three million four hundred
                            thousand, it now derives greater force and equity from the increased
                            population, wealth, production, and tonnage of the States on the
                            Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our
                            right, the principle for which he contended has been frequently, and by
                            various nations, recognized by law or by treaty, and has been extended
                            to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence, in
                            1831, the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first
                            navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spain and Portugal,
                            concluded in 1835, the navigation of the Douro, throughout its whole
                            extent, was made free for the subjects of both crowns. In 1853 the
                            Argentine Confederation, by treaty, threw open the free navigation of
                            the Parana and the Uruguay to the merchant-vessels of all nations. In
                            1856 the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which provided for the free
                            navigation of the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it
                            regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with fixed
                            principles of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for
                            the commerce of all nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by
                            treaty, and in December,.1866, the Emperor of Brazil, by imperial
                            decree, declared the Amazon to be open, to the frontier of Brazil, to
                            the merchant-ships of all nations. Sir Robert Phillimore, the greatest
                            living British authority on this subject, while asserting the abstract
                            right of the British claim, says: “It seems difficult to deny that Great
                            Britain may ground her refusal upon strict <hi rend="italic">law;</hi>
                            but it is equally difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she
                            exercises harshly an extreme and hard law; secondly, that her conduct
                            with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is in glaring and
                            discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to the
                            navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290"
                                facs="0348"/>that she possesses a small domain, in which the
                            Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on the right to navigate the
                            entire volume of its waters. On the ground that she possesses both banks
                            of the St. Lawrence where it disembogues itself into the sea, she denies
                            to the United States the right of navigation, though about half the
                            waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior, and the whole of
                            Lake Michigan, through which the river flows, are the property of the
                            United States.” (See Phillimore’s International Law, vol. 1, page 167
                                <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>, where the authorities are collected
                            and reviewed.)</p>
                        <p>The canals in aid of the lake and Saint Lawrence navigation are: 1. The
                            Sault Ste. Marie Canal, in the dominions of the United States. Vessels
                            between Lake Huron and Lake Superior must pass through this canal. 2.
                            The Saint Clair Canal, in the dominions of the United States, which is a
                            deepening of the channel to the depth of fourteen feet. 3. The Well and
                            Canal, in British dominions, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. 4. Several
                            canals between Lake Ontario and tidewater, in the aggregate about forty
                            miles in length. 5. The canal between Lake Champlain and the river Saint
                            Lawrence. Neither of the Canadian canals have at present the capacity of
                            the American canals.</p>
                        <p><seg type="margin">1870, July 12.</seg> A confidential memorandum was
                            submitted by Great Britain as the basis of proposed arrangements on the
                            subject of the navigation of the Saint Lawrence, and other inland waters
                            of British North America, &amp;c. This was in substance as follows: That
                            if a satisfactory reciprocity-treaty could be made, the United States
                            should be restored to the enjoyment of the fisheries as under the old
                            reciprocity-treaty; and also to the navigation of the inland waters of
                            Canada; provided, further, that like permission in the United States
                            should be granted to Canada. Canada was also willing to further agree to
                            enlarge and improve the access to the ocean, provided she could have
                            assurance of the permanency of the arrangement for reciprocity. The
                            proposal further contemplated throwing open the coasting-trade to each
                            party; reciprocal patent and copyright laws; arrangements for a
                            reciprocal transit trade; extension of the provisions of the extradition
                            treaties, and a re-adjustment of the Canadian excise-duty.</p>
                        <p>No steps were taken in the direction of carrying out these
                            suggestions.</p>
                        <p>The present importance of some of these points may be estimated from the

                            north and east of the United States was burdened with a system of
                            differential duties which discriminated against foreign importations in
                            favor of British to such an extent as to prevent any extensive
                            importations into those provinces from the United States.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances our exports, which, for the four years
                            preceding the reciprocity-treaty, averaged about eleven millions of

                            by authorizing the Canadian legislature to regulate their own tariff. In
                            1846 the Canadian legislature removed the existing differential duties,
                            and admitted American manufactures and foreign goods, purchased in the
                            American markets, on the same terms as those from Great Britain. This
                            change gave a considerable impetus to importations from the United
                            States, so that by the years 1851–’52–’53 they were upward of twelve,

                            letter of 6th January, 1851, from Mr. F. Hincks, inspector-general of
                            customs, Canada, to Hon. R. McLane, chairman of Committee on Commerce,
                            House of Representatives. Sir H. L. Bulwer thinks that the Canadians
                            consider that their application for an interchange of agricultural
                            products has failed because they have generously, without stipulations,
                            conceded many commercial advantages which it was in their power to
                            bestow; and that their only mode of securing desired privileges is to
                            revoke concessions made. His attention had been drawn to two resolutions
                            which passed the Senate on the subject, which he was told would have
                            passed the House if proposed to that body.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hincks, in his letter to Mr. McLane, recites the important changes
                            which have occurred in the colonial policy of Great Britain concerning
                            the regulation of commercial matters, and the removal of differential
                            duties from American productions; that had Canada at that time
                            stipulated that in return for her admission of American manufactures,
                            the duties should be removed from her products, it would have been the
                            interest of the United States to have agreed to it. No such proposition,
                            however, was made; and the very important concession scarcely attracted
                            attention in the United States. Describes the important results in the
                            increased demand for American productions in the provinces, and the
                            hardship of Canadian raw products, sent to the United States, being
                            burdened with high duties. Urges with much force and <pb n="294"

                            made by Mr. Webster in preparations to negotiate with Mr. Crampton on
                            the fisheries and commercial reciprocity. President still desirous that
                            negotiation should proceed; and it would be taken up as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>President Fillmore sent to Congress, on the 7th February, 1853, a
                            message, inclosing report from Secretary of State, giving the state of
                            the pending negotiation, which he, Mr. Everett, said had been
                            dilligently pursued; reported the willingness of British government to
                            arrange the fishery question. Refers to desire for reciprocal free
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Refers also to a resolution on the subject which passed the House some
                            time previously, and to the attention paid to the subject by Congress.
                            Time necessarily to be consumed in the negotiation in consequence of
                            necessity of British minister referring to London for instructions,
                            would probably render impossible the conclusion of a comprehensive
                            arrangement that session. Meantime recommends that a bill admitting
                            provincial fish free, on condition that United States fishermen are
                            admitted to full participation of provincial fisheries, be passed that
                            session. (<hi rend="italic">Ho. Reps., Ex. Doc</hi>. 40, 32<hi

                            to Mr. Crampton, acknowledges receipt of a memorandum indicating
                            additional subjects which British government desires to have brought
                            into pending negotiation relative to fisheries and reciprocity trade.
                            Deemed preferable to restrict negotiation to the objects already under
                            discussion, though no objection exists to including other matters when
                            obviously connected with these objects. (<hi rend="italic">Record of

                        <p><seg type="margin">1853.</seg> In the summer of 1853, Mr. Marcy discussed
                            with Mr. Crampton the questions involved in the proposed treaty; but no
                            record exists in this Department indicating the nature of those
                            discussions, except a note of September 1, 1853, from Mr. Marcy to Mr.
                            Crampton, submitting a <hi rend="italic">projet</hi> of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Says his comments will be brief, because his views have been already
                            presented in conferences.</p>
                        <p>Says the third article is a new one, inserted to bring in northwest coast
                            of British possessions.</p>
                        <p>By second article of <hi rend="italic">projet</hi> heretofore submitted
                            by British government, and by the same article of that submitted to Mr.
                            Crampton, and by him referred to his government, no restriction made to
                            any part of United States coasts; therefore it is but fair to open
                            Pacific coast of British possessions to United States fishermen. Has
                            introduced in article 2 a clause excepting coast of Florida, not on
                            account of value of fisheries, but apprehended interference with slave
                            population by free blacks from Bahamas, and partly also from apprehended
                            interference with rights of wreckers. Has excepted also shell-fish, to
                            prevent misapprehension. Has amended the expression in the first article
                            of the British draught, which prohibited United States fisher men from
                            interfering “with the operations of the British fishermen/’ so that it
                            will read: Provided, that in so doing they do not interfere with the
                            rights of private property, or with British fishermen in the peaceable
                            use of any part of said coast in their occupancy, &amp;c. Proposes

                        <p>Seventeenth March, 1870, Sir E. Thornton wrote to Mr. Fish a private and
                            confidential letter. He had a reply to inquiries made at Mr. Fish’s
                            suggestion, whether the Canadian government would grant the free
                            navigation of the Welland Canal and Saint Lawrence, <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0360"/>and put the canal into a proper state
                            for navigation, in return for a considerable reduction in the import
                            duties in this country on lumber, salt, fish, and coal, or a possible
                            abolition of all duty on the first three articles. In reply, Canadian
                            government regrets absence from the proposal of products of the most
                            populous sections of Dominion. Of the four articles named, without
                            knowing how much the duty on coal could be diminished, they consider
                            that the free importation of fish would be the only satisfactory part of
                            the proposal. 1870, Mar. 17.</p>
                        <p>Incloses two schedules which Mr. Fish suggested would be necessary; one a
                            free list, the other of articles which might have to be subject to
                            certain rates of duty.</p>
                        <p>Schedule No. 1 is a free list; No. 2 a list of articles to pay a certain
                            import duty in both countries. If they are adopted by United States, or
                            propose not unacceptable modifications, free navigation of the Saint
                            Lawrence and the use of the canals will be granted; and he is authorized
                            to declare that it is the policy of Canada to maintain the greatest
                            efficiency in canals. Asks early answer.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">synopsis</hi>.</p>
                        <p>By the 1st article of the treaty between the United States and Great
                            Britain of the 15th of June, 1816, it was stipulated that the line of
                            boundary between the territories of the parties on the forty-ninth
                            parallel should stop in the middle of the channel which separates the
                            continent from Vancouver’s Island, and should proceed thence southerly
                            through the middle of that channel and of Fuca’s Straits, to the Pacific
                            Ocean.</p>
                        <p>The point in dispute between the two governments is, as to which channel
                            was meant by the words referred to. On the part of the United States it
                            is contended that no other than the Haro, and on the part of Great
                            Britain that no other than the Rosario Channel could have been in
                            contemplation.</p>
                        <p>The United States also contend that the history of the negotiation shows
                            that, in abandoning a claim to have the boundary of the forty-ninth
                            parallel extended to the Pacific, and thereby relinquishing the whole of
                            Vancouver’s Island to Great Britain, they were actuated by an
                            expectation that all other islands south of that parallel and east of
                            the Haro Channel would fall to them. The United States also contend that
                            the parties could not have supposed that any other channel was meant
                            than the widest, the deepest, and the shortest between the Straits of
                            Fuca and the mouth of Fraser River, which conditions are only fulfilled
                            by the Haro Channel; that the navigation to and from Fuca’s Straits by
                            the Rosario Channel is comparatively circuitous, and that if that
                            channel were to be the line, it would throw into the possession of Great
                            Britain all the islands below the forty-ninth parallel and east of
                            Vancouver.</p>
                        <p>The objects and intentions of the parties in agreeing to the first
                            article of the treaty of the 15th June, 1846, seem to be well
                            illustrated by the following antecedents to that instrument:</p>
                        <p>By the third article of the treaty between the United States and Great
                            Britain of the 20th October, 1818, the parties agreed to a joint
                            occupation of the territory which they might respectively claim on the
                            northwest coast of America west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                        <p>By their treaty with Spain of the 22d of February, 1819, the United
                            States acquired any title which the latter may have had in the same
                            territory north of the forty-second parallel of latitude.</p>
                        <p>By their treaty with Great Britain of the 6th of August, 1827, the joint
                            occupation of the territory referred to was indefinitely extended, upon
                            the condition that if, after the 20th of October, 1828, either party
                            should give twelve months’ notice to the other, the convention would be
                            abrogated at the expiration of the said term of notice.</p>
                        <p>The forty-second parallel of latitude was also made the southern boundary
                            of the United States wet of the Rocky Mountains, by their treaty with
                            Mexico of April, 1831.</p>
                        <p>In a letter to Mr. Upshur, Secretary of State, of the 14th of November,
                                <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0365"/>1813, Mr. Everett, United
                            States minister to London, gives an account of an interview which he had
                            had with Lord Aberdeen on the 6th of that month. His lordship considered
                            that the question as to the northwestern boundary stood as it had been
                            left by Mr. Gallatin in his negotiation with Messrs. Huskisson and
                            Addington, in 1827. Lord Aberdeen assented to a remark of Mr. Everett,
                            that the numerous stations which the Hudson’s Bay Company had
                            established south of the 49th degree, since 1818, though they would
                            embarrass the British government in reference to that company, and,
                            through them, in reference to public opinion, ought not to prejudice the
                            claims of the United States. Mr. Everett also remarked that, in offering
                            the line of 49°, we acted fairly and liberally; that the offer was based
                            on the natural principles of distribution, while they, in refusing that
                            offer and insisting on the Columbia River, disregarded such principles,
                            and simply insisted upon a boundary very favorable to themselves. The
                            United States offer was in accordance with the rules of the English
                            charters, of running northern and southern boundaries from sea to sea.
                            To an objection of Lord Aberdeen, that lines of latitude were arbitrary,
                            Mr. Everett answered, that they were as likely to be in favor of Great
                            Britain as of the United States, and, besides, could readily
                            be-ascertained by men of science; that the part of the boundary on the
                            49th parallel was the only one respecting which no controversy had
                            arisen or was to be feared. Finally, Mr. Everett said, that an equal
                            partition of the territory was an obvious and natural principle of
                            division, and that the forty-ninth parallel was nearly an equal division
                            of the region between 42° and 54°.40. Mr. Everett said to Lord Aberdeen,
                            that when the United States presented themselves before the tribunal of
                            the public opinion of the world, with a statement of the nature and
                            foundation of their claim to the whole territory, as the successors of
                            Spain, and that they had offered to England a partition as nearly equal
                            as could be made, reserving to themselves only the half to what they had
                            a better independent claim than England, founded on prior discovery,
                            occupation, and exploration, and to which they had the fair claim of
                            contiguity and natural extension, there could not be a doubt but that
                            the decision of that tribunal would be in their favor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Everett went on to remark that the main difficulty in the adoption of
                            the forty-ninth degree to the ocean was, that it had already been thrice
                            offered to Great Britain and always rejected. To meet this difficulty,
                            suggested Mr. Everett, it might deserve the President’s consideration
                            whether he would not agree to give up the southern extremity of Quadra
                            and Vancouver’s Island, (which the forty-ninth degree would leave within
                            the United States,) on condition that the entrance of the Straits of
                            Juan de Fuca should at all times be left open and free to the United
                            States, with a free navigation between that island and the mainland, and
                            a free outlet to the north.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch of the 2d of December, Mr. Everett gives an account of
                            another interview with Lord Aberdeen on the 29th of November, 1843, in
                            the course of which his lordship stated that it would be impossible for
                            the ministry, for the time being, to accept what had been rejected in
                            1824 and 1826; that they did not suppose that we, any more than
                            themselves, could now agree to terms which we had then declined; and
                            that, consequently, there must be concession on both sides; that they
                            were willing to act on this principle, and that we must do the same.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Everett says that he regarded that observation, now made to him for
                            the first time, as very important. He told Lord Aberdeen that he thought
                            it would be very difficult for the United States to make any <pb n="308"
                                xml:id="pg_308" facs="0366"/>modification of their former proposal,
                            except in one point, which he regarded as very important to England. He
                            thought the President might be induced so far to depart from the
                            forty-ninth parallel as to leave the whole of Quadra and Vancouver’s
                            Island to England, whereas that line of latitude would give the United
                            States the southern extremity of that island, and consequently the
                            command of the straits of Fuca. Mr. Everett said that he was not
                            authorized to say whether that would be agreed to, but that he thought
                            and wished it might be. He then pointed out on a map the extent of the
                            concession, which Lord Aberdeen said he would take into
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch of the 1st of April, 1844, Mr. Everett gives an account of
                            another interview which he had with Lord Aberdeen on the 16th of March,
                            in the course of which he remarked that, in proportion as his lordship
                            should be inclined to think that the offer formerly made by the United
                            States to continue the forty-ninth to the sea was an equitable offer, he
                            ought to be satisfied with but a moderate departure from that proposal,
                            particularly if such modification, without involving a great sacrifice
                            to the United States, were eminently advantageous to Great Britain. In
                            fact, such a modification was the only one which the United States, in
                            Mr. Everett’s opinion, could be brought to agree to. A waiver by the
                            United States of their claim to the southern extremity of Quadra and
                            Vancouver’s Island, which would be cut off by the forty-ninth degree of
                            latitude, was precisely of that kind. Lord Aberdeen did not commit
                            himself as to whether such a proposition would be accepted.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Calhoun, of the 28th of February, 1845, Mr. Everett,
                            referring to the proceedings in Congress in regard to the establishment
                            of a territorial government in Oregon, stated that he had had several
                            conversations with Lord Aberdeen. Mr. Everett expressed an opinion
                            founded on them, that England would never accept the naked proposition
                            of the forty-ninth degree; but that she would accept that line with the
                            modification to which he had referred in previous dispatches, namely:
                            the southern extremity of Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, though Lord
                            Aberdeen had never told him that they would do this, and he was
                            confident that this was the best boundary which the United States could
                            get by negotiation.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, of the 3d of March, 1846, Mr. McLane
                            referred to interviews which he had had with Lord Aberdeen, and stated
                            that he had little or no expectation that the British government would
                            offer or assent to a better partition than the extension of a line on
                            the 49th parallel to the Straits of Fuca, and thence through the middle
                            of those straits to the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, of the 18th of May, 1846, Mr. McLane
                            remarked: "I have now to acquaint you that, after the receipt of your
                            dispatches on the 15th instant, by the Caledonia, I had a lengthened
                            conference with Lord Aberdeen, on which occasion the resumption of the
                            negotiation for an amicable settlement of the Oregon question, and the
                            nature of the proposition he contemplated submitting for that purpose,
                            formed the subject of a full and free conversation. I have now to state
                            that instructions will be transmitted to Mr. Pakenham by the steamer of
                            to-morrow, to submit a new and further proposition on the part of this
                            government for a partition of the territory in dispute.”</p>
                        <p>The proposition, most probably, will offer substantially: "First. To
                            divide the territory by the extension of the line on the parallel of
                            forty-nine to the sea; that is to say, to the arm of the sea called
                            Birch’s Bay; thence by the Canal de Arro and Straits of Fuca to the
                            ocean, and confirming to the United State’s what, indeed they would
                            possess <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0367"/>without any special
                            confirmation, the right freely to use and navigate the straits
                            throughout its extent."</p>
                        <p>June 29, 1846, in the House of Commons, Sir Robert Peel, in tendering the
                            resignation of the ministry, said, in reference to the termination of
                            the existing convention for the joint occupation of Oregon by Great
                            Britain and the United States: “It appeared to us that the addition of
                            that conciliatory declaration—the expression of a hope that the
                            termination of the convention might the more strongly impress upon the
                            two countries the necessity of amicable adjustment—removed any barrier
                            which diplomatic punctilios might have raised to a renewal by this
                            country of the attempt to settle our differences with the United States.
                            We did not hesitate, therefore, within two days after the receipt of
                            that intelligence—we did not hesitate, although the offer of arbitration
                            made by us had been rejected—to do that which, in the present state of
                            the protracted dispute, it became essential to do, namely, not to
                            propose renewed and lengthened negotiations, but to specify frankly and
                            without reserve what were the terms on which we could consent to a
                            partition of the country of the Oregon. Sir, the President of the United
                            States met us in corresponding spirit. Whatever might have been the
                            expressions heretofore used by him, however strongly he might have been
                            personally committed to the adoption of a different course, he most
                            wisely and patriotically determined at once to refer our proposals to
                            the Senate, that authority of the United States whose consent is
                            requisite for the conclusion of any negotiation of this kind, and the
                            Senate, acting also in the same pacific spirit, has, I have the
                            heartfelt satisfaction to state, at once advised acquiescence in the
                            terms we offered. From the importance of the subject, and considering
                            that this is the last day I shall have to address the house as a
                            minister of the Crown, I may, perhaps, be allowed to state what are the
                            proposals we made to the United States for the final settlement of the
                            Oregon question. In order to prevent the necessity for renewed
                            diplomatic negotiations, we prepared and sent out the form of a
                            convention, which we trusted the United States would accept."</p>
                        <p>Here Sir Robert Peel quoted the language of the first article of the
                            treaty, and, in explanation thereof, continued: “Those who remember the
                            local conformation of that country will understand that that which we
                            proposed is the continuation of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude
                            till it strikes the Straits of Fuca; that that parallel should not be
                            continued as a boundary across Vancouver’s Island, thus depriving us of
                            a part of Vancouver’s Island; but that the middle of the channel shall
                            be the future boundary, thus leaving us in possession of the whole of
                            Vancouver’s Island, with equal right to navigation of the straits. Sir,
                            the second article of the convention we sent for the acceptance of the
                            United States was to this effect.”</p>
                        <p>Here Sir Robert Peel quoted the second article of the treaty, relating to
                            the navigation of the Columbia River.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, he said: “Sir, I will not occupy the attention of the House
                            with mere details. I have read the important articles.”</p>
                        <p>Sir Robert further quoted an official letter from Mr. Pakenham,
                            intimating the acceptance of the British proposals, and giving assurance
                            of the immediate termination of differences with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pakenham wrote, under date of June 13, that “the President sent a
                            message on Wednesday last to the Senate, submitting for the opinion of
                            that body the draught of a convention for the settlement of the Oregon
                            question;" that after a few hours’ deliberation on each of the three
                            days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—the Senate, by a <pb n="310"
                                xml:id="pg_310" facs="0368"/>majority of thirty-eight votes to
                            twelve, adopted yesterday evening a resolution advising the President to
                            accept the terms proposed by Her Majesty’s government. President
                            Buchanan accordingly sent for me this morning, and informed me that the
                            conditions offered by Her Majesty’s government were accepted by the
                            Government of the United States, without the addition or alteration of a
                            single word. Thus, sir, the governments of two great nations, impelled,
                            I believe, by the public opinion of each country in favor of peace, have
                            by moderation, by mutual compromise, averted the dreadful calamity of a
                            war between two nations of kindred origin and common language.” (<hi

                        <p>Mr. J. McHenry Boyd, chargé d’affaires of the United States at London, in
                            a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, Secretary of State, of the 19th of October,
                            1846, represents that British subjects contemplated settling on Whitby’s
                            Island, one of those within the Straits of Fuca, south of the
                            forty-ninth parallel; that the British government had consequently been
                            thrown into some doubt whether, according to the boundary in the Oregon
                            treaty, that island would fall within American or British jurisdiction.
                            Mr. Boyd accordingly suggested that if the Department was not already in
                            possession of evidence clearly defining the line, measures should be
                            taken toward obtaining it, for the purpose of meeting the question when
                            it should arise.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan of the 3d of November, 1846, Mr. Bancroft,
                            then United States minister at London, requested a copy of Wilkes’s
                            chart of the Straits of Haro, it having been intimated to him that
                            questions might arise with regard to the islands east of that strait.
                            Mr. Bancroft requested authority to meet any such claim at the
                            threshold, by the assertion of the central channel of Straits of Haro as
                            the main channel intended by the recent treaty of Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buchanan complied with Mr. Bancroft’s request by an instruction of
                            the 28th of December, 1846. The instruction remarks that it was not
                            probable that the British government would seriously claim any island
                            east of the Canal of Haro. That no doubt that was the channel which Lord
                            Aberdeen had in view when, in conversation with Mr. McLane, about the
                            middle of May, 1846, he explained the character of the proposition he
                            intended to submit through Mr. Pakenham, the British minister at
                            Washington. This was, first, to divide the territory by the extension of
                            the line on the parallel of 49° to the sea; that is to say, to the arm
                            of the sea called Birch’s Bay, thence by the Canal de Haro and Straits
                            of Fuca to the ocean.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan of the 29th of March, 1847, Mr. Bancroft
                            adverts to supposed wishes of the Hudson’s Bay Company to get some of
                            the islands on our side of the line in the Straits of Fuca, and says
                            that he would not be surprised if a formal proposition should soon be
                            made by the British government to run the line. The proposition <pb
                                n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0369"/>would in itself be proper if
                            there should be no ulterior motive to raise unnecessary doubts and to
                            claim islands, that are properly ours. He expressed his belief that the
                            ministry had no such design. Some of its members would be the first to
                            frown on it.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, of the 4th of August, 1848, Mr. Bancroft
                            says that he had been told by Lord Palmerston that he had made a
                            proposition at Washington for marking the boundary and for ascertaining
                            the division line in the channel by noting the bearings of certain
                            objects. “I observed that the water in the channel of Haro did not
                            require to be divided, though, of course, the islands east of the center
                            channel of Haro were ours. He spoke of the propriety of settling
                            definitively the ownership of the several islands, in order that
                            settlements might not be begun by one party on what properly belonged to
                            the other.”</p>
                        <p>In a note to Mr. Buchanan, of the 13th of January, 1848, Mr. Crampton
                            stated that he had been instructed to propose that the two governments
                            should proceed to mark the boundary defined in the treaty. After
                            remarking upon other parts of the line, he goes on to say: “But between
                            the Gulf of Georgia and the Straits of Fuca the line is less distinctly
                            and accurately defined by the verbal description of the treaty by which
                            it is established, and local circumstances render it probable that if
                            this part of the line were not to be precisely determined, the
                            uncertainty as to its course might give rise to disputes between British
                            subjects and citizens of the United States.” Mr. Crampton also said, in
                            substance, that as the point in the center of the channel between
                            Vancouver's Island and the continent could not, probably, be marked out
                            by any object to be permanently fixed on the spot, it should be
                            ascertained by the intersection of cross-bearings of natural and
                            artificial landmarks.</p>
                        <p>He goes on in the following words: “But in regard to this portion of the
                            boundary-line, a preliminary question arises, which turns upon the
                            interpretation of the treaty rather than upon the result of local
                            observation and survey. The convention of the 15th of June, 1846,
                            declares that the line shall be drawn through the middle of the <hi
                                rend="italic">channel</hi> which separates the continent from
                            Vancouver’s Island. And upon this it may be asked what the word
                            ‘channel’ intended to mean. Generally speaking, the word ‘channel,’ when
                            employed in treaties, means a deep and navigable channel. In the present
                            case it is believed that only one channel, that, namely, which was laid
                            down by Vancouver in his chart, has, in this part of the Gulf, been
                            hitherto surveyed and used, and it seems natural to suppose that the
                            negotiators of the Oregon convention, in employing the word ‘ channel,’
                            had that particular channel in view.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Crampton’s note was accompanied by a draught of instructions to the
                            commissioners for marking the boundary.</p>
                        <p>The receipt of the communication, however, does not appear to have been
                            acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>With a note to Lord Palmerston of the 31st of July, 1848, Mr. Bancroft
                            sent a copy of Wilkes’s chart of the Straits of Juan de Fuca; but
                            remarked that, though it did not extend to the parallel of 49°, it
                            contained the wide entrance into the Straits of Haro, the channel
                            through the middle of which the boundary was to be continued.</p>
                        <p>With a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan of the 19th of October, 1848, Mr.
                            Bancroft sent a copy of the map of Vancouver’s Island, by Wyld,
                            geographer to the Queen. It purports to mark, by a dotted line, the
                            boundary between the United States and Great Britain. “You will see that
                            this map suggests an encroachment on our rights by adopting a line far
                            to the east of the Straits of Haro.”</p>

                        <p>With a note to Lord Palmerston of the 3d of November, 1848, Mr. Bancroft
                            sent him a copy of the United States surveys of the waters of Puget
                            Sound and those dividing Vancouver’s Island from our territory. Mr.
                            Bancroft remarked, “Your lordship will readily trace the whole course of
                            the Channel of Haro, through the middle of which our boundary-line
                            passes.”</p>
                        <p>In a note to Mr. Bancroft of the 7th of November Lord Palmerston thanked
                            him for the surveys.</p>
                        <p>An act of the Congress of the United States was passed on the 11th of
                            August, 1856, providing for the demarkation of the boundary on our part.
                            Mr. Archibald Campbell was appointed commissioner. The instructions of
                            Mr. Marcy, Secretary of State, addressed to him in that character, bear
                            date the 25th of February, 1857. They do not advert to any particulars
                            in regard to the water-boundary. The following is a paragraph of the
                            instructions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Having completed the organization and outfit, and made the other
                                    preparations indicated, you will repair to Fuca Straits, via San
                                    Francisco, to meet the commissioner on the part of the British
                                    government, and proceed with him to determine such portion of
                                    the line described in the first article of the treaty as is
                                    provided for by the act above cited.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Captain James C. Prevost, of Her Britannic Majesty’s ship Satellite, was
                            the commissioner on the part of Great Britain. After divers conferences
                            with Mr. Campbell on the subject of the water-boundary, he addressed a
                            letter to him under date the 28th of October, 1857, setting forth his
                            objections to the adoption of the line of the Haro Channel. These are,
                            in substance, that when the line from the initial point in the Gulf of
                            Georgia proceeds in a southerly direction as far as 48° 45′ of north
                            latitude, it meets a group of islands through which there are two
                            passages. One of these, called Rosario Strait, is near the continent,
                            and the other, called Haro Channel, is nearer Vancouver’s Island. He
                            asserts that the only navigable channel separating the continent from
                            Vancouver’s Island is Rosario Strait.</p>
                        <p>He claims that the channel contemplated by the treaty should possess
                            three characteristics: 1st. It should separate the continent from
                            Vancouver’s Island; 2d. It should admit of the boundary-line being
                            carried through the middle of it in a southerly direction; 3d, It should
                            be a navigable channel. To these conditions the Rosario Strait most
                            entirely answers. He goes on to admit that the Haro Channel is also
                            navigable, but on account of the currents and the want of
                            anchorage-grounds, not so easily so. He asserts that that channel does
                            not separate the continent from Vancouver’s Island, and that the line to
                            reach that channel must proceed for some distance in a westerly
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Campbell replied on the 2d of November, 1857, that as the Haro
                            Channel was pre-eminent in width, depth, and volume of water, this must
                            have been the one contemplated by the treaty. It was known under its
                            name since the first discovery, and was the only one usually designated
                            by name on the maps in use at the time the treaty was under
                            consideration, while the other channels only separate the islands in the
                            group from each other; the Haro Channel for a considerable distance
                            north of the Straits of Fuca, and where their waters unite, washes the
                            shore of Vancouver’s Island, and is therefore the only one which,
                            according to the language of the treaty, separates the continent from
                            Vancouver’s Island.</p>
                        <p>The term southerly used in the treaty would not admit of the demarkation
                            of the line in a due south direction through any channel. It <pb n="313"
                                xml:id="pg_313" facs="0371"/>was consequently to be presumed that
                            the genera<gap quantity="1" unit="characters"/> direction only was to be
                            toward the south.</p>
                        <p>Rosaria Straits do not separate the continent from Vancouver’s Island,
                            but some islands from others; although the relative merits of the
                            navigability for sailing-vessels of the Haro Channel and Rosario Straits
                            was not to be regarded as having any bearing on the determination of the
                            question. Captain Alden, however, of the United States Navy, who, in the
                            years 1853 and 1855, had made surveys of those waters, had officially
                            reported the Haro Channel as the widest, deepest, and best. Reference is
                            then made to the dispatch of Mr. McLane to Mr. Buchanan of the 18th of
                            May, 1846, in which he reported that the line of the Haro Channel was to
                            be proposed by the British government. Mr. Campbell thence infers that
                            the object of the framers of the treaty was to run the line so as to
                            avoid cutting off the southern cape of Vancouver’s Island by adopting
                            the line through the Haro Channel. The speech of Mr. Benton in the
                            Senate relative to the treaty shows the same understanding in regard to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Captain Prevost replied, under date of the 9th of November, that in his
                            opinion the Rosario Channel was the only one that conformed to the
                            language of the treaty, by separating the continent from Vancouver’s
                            Island. The Haro Channel separates Vancouver’s Island from the
                            continent. The usual terms of expression appear to be designedly
                            reversed in the treaty, for the lesser is not separated from the
                            greater, but the greater from the lesser. There is no navigable channel
                            between the continent and the islands on the east of Rosario Straits,
                            and, therefore, no such channel as the treaty calls for. From the Gulf
                            of Georgia to the Straits of Fuca the line can be carried through
                            Rosario Straits in a southerly, whereas through the Haro Channel it must
                            take a westerly direction.</p>
                        <p>The information given by Mr. McLane was as to a probable proposition. The
                            one adopted in the treaty was different.</p>
                        <p>He then refers to Preuss’s map of Oregon, printed by order of the Senate,
                            in which the line is carried through Rosario Channel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Campbell rejoined, under date of the 18th November, 1857, that in his
                            judgment no change in the position of the words used in the treaty could
                            make any difference in their meaning. Captain Prevost’s admission that
                            the Haro Channel is undoubtedly the navigable channel which, at its
                            position, separates Vancouver’s Island from the continent, might be
                            regarded as tantamount to a settlement of the question. Although Mr.
                            McLane and Mr. Benton were not the signers of the treaty, they had such
                            an official connection with the negotiations that their evidence should
                            have equal weight with that of the signers themselves. Immediately upon
                            the receipt of Mr. McLane’s dispatch of the 18th of May, Mr. Pakenham
                            submitted to Mr. Buchanan the draught of a convention. This draught was
                            laid before the Senate, with all the correspondence upon the subject,
                            and was approved by that body. The draught referred to is the same, word
                            for word, with the treaty as signed. Mr. Campbell shows that Captain
                            Prevost’s comment upon Mr. McLane’s dispatch, to the effect that
                            supposing the original proposition to have been as reported by that
                            gentleman it was designedly altered after discussion, to be without
                            foundation. No such discussion could have taken place between Mr. McLane
                            and Lord Aberdeen without being reported by the former; and none could
                            have taken place between Mr. Pakenham and Mr. Buchanan, as the former
                            was not authorized to enter into any. Preuss’s map had no official
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>Captain Prevost replied, under date of the 24th of November, 1858, that
                                <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0372"/>the continent as well as
                            the island must be regarded according to its natural signification and
                            according to its natural position; and that when two channels exist
                            between a continent and a particular island, the argument appeared
                            irresistible that the channel contiguous to the continent was the
                            channel separating the continent from the island, while the channel
                            contiguous to the island is the channel separating the island from the
                            continent. The inference that the Haro Channel was proposed by the
                            British government because that-happened to be mentioned in Mr. McLane’s
                            dispatch, was unwarrantable. He would be surprised if Captain Alden
                            should not agree with him that Rosario Straits are preferable to Haro
                            Channel for sailing-vessels. The treaty in the matter of the channel
                            separating the continent from Vancouver’s Island was clear, and he could
                            not admit any evidence on this subject to weigh with him that would lead
                            to an interpretation that the precise terms of the treaty would not
                            admit. Although he was firm in the conviction that Rosario Straits and
                            not Haro Channel was the one contemplated by the treaty, he was willing
                            to regard the Gulf of Georgia as one channel, and agree to a line
                            passing through the middle of it, so far as the islands would
                            permit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Campbell rejoined, under date of the 28th of November, 1858, that the
                            proposed instructions to the commissioners which accompanied Mr.
                            Crampton’s note to Mr. Buchanan, of the 13th of January, 1848, contained
                            the following sentence: “From that point you will carry on the line of
                            boundary along the forty-ninth parallel of latitude to the middle of the
                            channel between Vancouver’s Island and the continent.”</p>
                        <p>This, Mr. Campbell contends, shows the view of the British government
                            within two years after the conclusion of the treaty. He adds that, in
                            1848, Rosario Straits was not claimed on the ground that there was
                            anything peculiar in the wording of the treaty; nor was there any claim
                            founded upon the supposition of a “designed alteration” of the original
                            draught of the treaty by omitting the Haro Channel and substituting its
                            present language. In opposition to Captain Prevost’s opinion that the
                            words of the treaty were so peculiarly precise and clear as to point out
                            unmistakably Rosario Straits as the channel, Mr. Crampton, speaking on
                            the part of his government, says: “But between the Gulf of Georgia and
                            the Straits of Fuca the line is less distinctly and accurately defined
                            by the verbal description of the treaty.” In regard to this, Mr.
                            Campbell quotes the following passage from Vattel: “If he who can and
                            ought to have explained himself clearly and plainly has not done it, it
                            is the worse for him. He cannot be allowed to introduce subsequent
                            restrictions which he has not expressed.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Campbell declined accepting Captain Provost’s proposition, and
                            expressed the opinion that there was not the slightest probability that
                            the British government, Captain Prevost, or any other person, would ever
                            be called upon for a renewal of it.</p>
                        <p>Captain Prevost replied, under date of the 1st of December, 1857, that if
                            the treaty was intended by the United States Government to accord with
                            the correspondence of Mr. McLane and the speech of Mr. Benton, the
                            general maxim which Mr. Campbell had quoted from Vattel would be more
                            applicable to the United States than to the British government; for, if
                            the former intended that the line should run through the Haro Channel,
                            they should have taken care that it was so expressed “clearly and
                            plainly “in the treaty. In conclusion, he proposed a conference, in
                            order that it might be formally recorded that the commissioners were
                            unable to agree; that Mr. Campbell had declined to accede to his
                            proposition for a compromise, and, therefore, that the whole matter
                            might be referred to their respective governments.</p>
                        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0373"/>
                        <p>Mr. Campbell replied on the 2d of December, recapitulating his previous
                            arguments, and concluding with the remark that he thought any
                            proposition, with a view to concession on the part of United States, was
                            hardly justifiable under the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In a report to General Cass, Secretary of State, of the 25th of
                            September, 1858, Mr. Campbell represents that the settlement of the
                            question of the channel involves the sovereignty of the group of islands
                            called the Haro Archipelago, between the Haro Channel and Rosario
                            Straits, embraced in a space of about four hundred square miles. He then
                            proceeds to show the importance of these islands, in a military and
                            naval point of view, quoting official opinions of officers.</p>
                        <p>In a letter to Mr. Campbell of the 15th of June, 1858, Mr. Bancroft
                            states that he was in Mr. Polk’s cabinet when the Oregon treaty was
                            concluded, and that the general understanding, both in England and in
                            the United States, was, that the British boundary was to extend to the
                            middle of the Haro Channel.</p>
                        <p>In a full and elaborate report to General Cass of the 20th of January,
                            1859, Mr. Campbell reviewed his proceedings as commissioner, and
                            commented on the respective claims of the parties to the channel
                            mentioned in the treaty. In the course of his letter Mr. Campbell
                            expresses an opinion that the compromise line offered by Captain Prevost
                            would not be a suitable channel for a boundary, with such channels as
                            Haro and Rosario in its vicinity. In support of this opinion, he states
                            the maximum and minimum width of the several channels, and refers to
                            other important circumstances.</p>
                        <p>With a letter to the Department of the 21st of June, 1859, Mr. Campbell
                            transmitted a copy of the Coast Survey chart of the space between the
                            continent and Vancouver’s Island, corrected by the results of a survey
                            of the same space by Captain Richards, of the British navy, acting on
                            behalf of his government. In the course of his letter, Mr. Campbell
                            represents that the map adverted to shows that there is still another
                            channel nearer to Vancouver’s Island than that of Haro, which answers
                            the description in the treaty as separating the continent from that
                            island. The lines on the map indicate, according to Mr. Campbell’s
                            statement— <list>

                            December, 1856, and express the opinion that the Rosario Channel was the
                            boundary contemplated by the treaty. They use the following language:
                            “If, however, the commissioner of the United States will not adopt the
                            line along Rosario Straits, and if, on a detailed and accurate survey,
                            and on weighing the evidence on both sides of the question, you should
                            be of opinion that the claims of her Majesty’s government to consider
                            Rosario Straits as the channel indicated by the words of the treaty
                            cannot be substantiated, you would be at liberty to adopt any other
                            intermediate channel which you may discover on which the United States
                            commissioner and yourself may agree, as substantially in accordance with
                            the description of the treaty.”</p>
                        <p>A copy of these instructions having been communicated to Mr. Campbell, he
                            remarks, in a letter to the Department of the 4th of August, 1859, that
                            they show that Captain Prevost was by them virtually, if not positively,
                            prohibited from adopting the Haro Channel as the boundary channel
                            intended by the treaty.</p>
                        <p>With a letter to the Department of the 18th of August, 1858, Mr. Campbell
                            communicated information of the landing of a company of United States
                            troops, under command of Captain Pickett, on the island of San Juan, on
                            the 26th of July. He also communicated a copy of the protest of Governor
                            Douglas, of Vancouver’s Island, against the military occupation of that
                            island by any other than a British force.</p>
                        <p>In a letter of Mr. Drinkard, Acting Secretary of War, to General Harney,
                            of the 3d of September, 1859, the occupation of San Juan Island by a
                            military force is not approved.</p>
                        <p>In a letter of Mr. Drinkard to General Scott, of the 16th of September,
                            1859, the wish of the President was referred to that he should take
                            command of the military forces on the Pacific coast, and he was
                            instructed that until the title to the island of San Juan could be
                            adjusted it would be desirable for him to arrange for a joint occupation
                            of that island.</p>
                        <p>This General Scott did, in a letter of the 25th of October, 1859, to
                            Governor Douglas, of Vancouver’s Island. The proposition was at first
                            declined, but was afterward practically acceded to by the landing of a
                            body of British marines at the north end of the island. The joint
                            military occupation has ever since continued.</p>
                        <p>Under date the 12th of May, 1859, Lord Lyons addressed a note to General
                            Cass relative to attempts of citizens of the United States to establish
                            themselves on the island of San Juan, and stated that his government
                            trusted that the United States Government would, so far as it could,
                            restrain them from attempting to settle, by unauthorized acts of
                            violence, a question which there would probably be little difficulty in
                            arranging by amicable communication between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>In an instruction to Lord Lyons of the 24th of August, 1859, Lord Russell
                            referred to the disagreement between the American and British
                            commissioners in regard to the demarkation of the water boundary,
                            expressed regret that no map was annexed to the treaty of 1846, but
                            stated that his government fully concurred with their commissioner that
                            the line should run through Rosario Straits. He then proceeded to review
                            the arguments on both sides, and concluded by proposing the same
                            compromise line as that offered to Mr. Campbell by Captain Prevost, and
                            by declaring that his government must, under any circumstances, maintain
                            its right to the island of San Juan.</p>
                        <p>This paper was fully replied to by General Cass in an instruction to Mr.
                            Dallas of the 20th of October, 1859. After adverting to circumstances
                                <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0375"/>leading to the treaty of
                            1846, and stating that the object of the United States in accepting that
                            instrument was to allow to Great Britain the whole of Vancouver’s
                            Island, but to exclude her from any other territory south of the
                            parallel of 49°, the instruction goes on to remark that the friendly
                            sentiments expressed in Lord Russell’s paper do not harmonize with the
                            declaration which it contained that the British government would, under
                            any circumstances, maintain its right to the island of San Juan. If this
                            declaration should be insisted on, said General Cass, it must terminate
                            the negotiation at its threshold. The proposition for compromise assumes
                            that the disagreement in respect to the treaty is irreconcilable. The
                            failure of the commissioners to agree was in part, at least, imputable
                            to the peculiar character of the instructions to the British
                            commissioner. At the time of the negotiation of the treaty, all that the
                            British government claimed was that the line should deflect from the
                            forty-ninth parallel so far as to assign to them the whole of
                            Vancouver’s Island. This was all that the American Government conceded.
                            Mr. Buchanan had instructed Mr. McLane that, except for this, purpose,
                            the President would never consent to bring the British boundary a single
                            inch below the parallel of 49°, and no other purpose than this was
                            anywhere’ avowed. The Haro is the only channel which would not leave
                            something more to Great Britain south of the forty-ninth parallel than
                            the southern cape of Vancouver’s Island. Whether the Haro was or was not
                            the true channel in the opinion of the British negotiators, it was quite
                            certain, from current testimony of both the American and British
                            negotiators, that the Rosario Channel was not. The Douglas Channel,
                            which was suggested by Lord Russel, is admitted to be an inferior one,
                            scarcely capable of navigation, except by steamers, and was supposed to
                            be recommended because it would leave the island of San Juan to Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>In an instruction to Lord Lyons, of the 16th of December, 1859, Lord
                            Russell replied that his government could not concur in the conclusions
                            to which General Cass had arrived. What Lord Aberdeen meant by King
                            George’s Sound, down which the line was to run, might be clearly
                            inferred from a letter addressed to him at the time of the conclusion of
                            the treaty, by Sir John Pelly, then the governor of the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company, of which letter the following is an extract: “With respect to
                            the other islands, the water demarkation line should be from the center
                            of the water in the Gulf of Georgia, in the forty-ninth degree, along
                            the line colored red as navigable in the chart made by Vancouver until
                            it reaches a line drawn through the center of the Straits of Juan de
                            Fuca. The only objection to this is giving to the United States the
                            valuable island of Whidbey.” However the British government might be
                            disposed to rely on the instructions of Lord Aberdeen and the letter of
                            Sir John Pelly, and the United States on the statements of Mr. McLane
                            and Mr. Benton, it must be confessed on both sides that the
                            interpretation of one party, without the expressed assent of the other,
                            goes but very little way to remove the difficulty. Lord Russel concludes
                            his paper with a direction to renew the offer of compromise.</p>
                        <p>General Cass, in an instruction to Mr. Dallas, of the 4th of February,
                            1860, after adverting to other points in the instruction of Lord Russell
                            to Lord Lyons of the 16th of December, 1859, states that, as Lord
                            Russell repeats his original declaration that no settlement of the
                            question would be accepted by the British government which did not
                            provide for the reservation of the island of San Juan to the British
                            Crown, the President had directed him to state that the United States
                            would, under all circumstances, maintain their right to the island in
                            controversy until <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0376"/>the question
                            of title to it should be determined by some amicable arrangement between
                            the parties.</p>
                        <p>In an instruction to Lord Lyons of the 9th of March, 1860, Lord Russell
                            refers to his declaration contained in his dispatch of the 21th of
                            August, to which exception was taken by General Cass, and was put
                            forward as a ground for declining to continue the discussion. Lord
                            Russell expresses disappointment that the explanation which Lord Lyons
                            was authorized to offer was not accepted as satisfactory, “Her Majesty’s
                            government maintain that either the Canal de Rosario or the Douglas
                            Channel might be held to be the boundary contemplated by the treaty; but
                            that the Canal de Haro neither fulfills the intention of the British
                            negotiators of the treaty, nor is consistent with the words of the
                            treaty itself.”</p>
                        <p>In an instruction to Mr. Dallas of the 23d of April, 1860, General Cass
                            remarked that, as Lord Russell had acknowledged that the expression
                            objected to in his dispatch of the 24th of August, 1859, was not
                            intended to convey the meaning which this Government had attached to it,
                            the subject was now free from the embarrassment occasioned thereby.
                            General Cass also referred to the speech of Sir Robert Peel on the
                            treaty in the House of Commons on the 29th of June, 1846, as showing
                            that the deflection in the line from the parallel of 49° had not left
                            Great Britain in the possession of any other island than that of
                            Vancouver. “While the President, therefore, feels himself obliged to
                            decline to adopt the Douglas Channel as the boundary of the two
                            countries between Vancouver’s Island and the continent, and to maintain
                            the Canal de Haro as the true boundary in that quarter, which was
                            intended by the treaty, he is glad to believe that no serious injury can
                            be inflicted on British interests by the adoption of the American
                            line.”</p>
                        <p>In a note to General Cass of the 10th of December, 1860, Lord Lyons
                            proposed that the question of the water boundary should be referred to
                            the arbitration of a reigning prince or sovereign state.</p>
                        <p>No reply appears to have been made to this note.</p>
                        <p>No diplomatic discussion of the question of boundary has since taken
                            place.</p>

                                    blockade of the ports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance
                                    of the laws of the United States and of the law of nations in
                                    such cases provided. For this purpose a competent force will be
                                    posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from the
                                    ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate such
                                    blockade, a vessel shall approach, or shall attempt to leave
                                    either of the said ports, she will be duly warned by the
                                    commander of one of the blockading vessels, who will indorse on
                                    her register the fact and date of such warning, and if the same
                                    vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port,
                                    she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port,
                                    for such proceedings against her and her cargo as prize as may
                                    be deemed advisable.</p>
                                <p>And I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the
                                    pretended authority of the said States, or under any other
                                    pretense, shall molest a vessel of the United States, or the
                                    persons or cargo on board of her, such persons will be held
                                    amenable to the laws of the United States for the prevention and
                                    punishment of piracy.</p>

                                <p>House of Commons, Mr. Gregory asked Lord Russell the following
                                    question: “3d. The Government of the United States having
                                    refused to relinquish the belligerent right of issuing letters
                                    of marque, the seven Southern confederated and sovereign States
                                    having become to the United States a separate and independent
                                    and foreign power, whether Her Majesty’s government recognize
                                    the right of the president of the southern confederacy to issue
                                    letters of marque; and if so, whether our minister at Washington
                                    has been notified to that effect?” (<hi rend="italic">Vol. IV,
                                        p</hi>. 482.)</p>
                                <p>Lord Russell, in reply, stated that, with respect to belligerent
                                    rights in the case of certain portions of a State being in
                                    insurrection, there was a precedent which seems applicable to
                                    this purpose in the year 1825. The British government at that
                                    time allowed the belligerent rights of the provisional
                                    government of Greece, and, in consequence of that allowanc, the
                                    Turkish government made a remonstrance. I may state the nature
                                    of that remonstrance and the reply of Mr. Canning. “The Turkish
                                    government complained that the British government allowed to the
                                    Greeks a belligerent character, and observed that it appeared to
                                    forget that to subjects in rebellion no national character could
                                    properly belong.” But the British government informed Mr.
                                    Stratford Canning <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0380"/>that
                                    the “character of belligerency was not so much a principle as a
                                    fact; that a certain degree of force and consistency acquired by
                                    any mass of population engaged in war entitled that population
                                    to be treated as a belligerent, and even if their title were
                                    questionable, rendered it the interest, well understood, of all
                                    civilized nations so to treat them. For what was the
                                    alternative? A power or a community (call it which you will)
                                    which was at war with another, and which covered the sea with
                                    its cruisers, must either be acknowledged as a belligerent or
                                    dealt with as a pirate;” which latter character, as applied to
                                    the Greeks, was loudly disclaimed. In a separate dispatch of the
                                    same date, (12th of October, 1825,) Sir Stratford Canning was
                                    reminded that when the British government acknowledged the right
                                    of either belligerent to visit and detain British
                                    merchant-vessels having enemy’s property on board, and to
                                    confiscate such property, it was necessarily implied, as a
                                    condition of such acknowledgment, that the detention was for the
                                    purpose of bringing the vessels detained before an established
                                    court of prize, and that confiscation did not take place until
                                    after condemnation by such competent tribunal. The question has
                                    been under the consideration of the government. They have
                                    consulted the law-officers of the Crown. The attorney and
                                    solicitor-general and the Queen’s advocate, and the government
                                    have come to the opinion that the southern confederacy of
                                    America, according to those principles, which seem to them to be
                                    just principles, must be treated as a belligerent.” (<hi

                                    belligerent rights. I hope that in that proclamation, or in some
                                    other way, a most distinct and emphatic warning will be given to
                                    all seamen in the service of Her Majesty as to the conditions
                                    upon which they will engage—if they choose to enter upon such

                                    be no doubt left on their minds, but the fullest and plainest
                                    intimation should be publicly made to them, whether, if they do
                                    engage in such a service, they will or will not in extremity be
                                    entitled to expect any protection or interference on the part of
                                    this country. I hope my noble friend will state to your
                                    lordships whether the government have come to any conclusion
                                    upon this question; and if so, whether they are prepared
                                    forthwith to issue a public and emphatic notification of the
                                    course they intend to pursue, and the consequences likely to
                                    result to British seamen from a disregard of their warning.</p>
                                <p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi>. The noble earl, by the
                                    manner in which he has approached the subject, has evinced a
                                    becoming appreciation of the difficulties which may arise to
                                    ourselves from the unfortunate state of things in the United
                                    State. With respect, however, to the question of the belligerent
                                    rights of the parties now engaged in that unhappy contest, the
                                    noble earl has not asked for any expression of opinion on the
                                    part of the government, and therefore I am absolved from
                                    entering into a discussion of that most important, difficult,
                                    and delicate subject. But the noble earl has inquired whether
                                        <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0381"/>it is our intention
                                    to issue a proclamation, warning the subjects of Her Majesty
                                    against in any manner departing from that neutrality which Her
                                    Majesty herself is so desirous to observe. To that question, as
                                    the noble earl has stated, an answer has already been given in
                                    “another place,” namely, that it is the intention of the
                                    government, according to precedent, to issue a proclamation,
                                    giving such warning to all the subjects of Her Majesty. The
                                    precise wording of the proclamation is a matter of considerable
                                    importance and difficulty requiring some deliberation, and we
                                    have thought it right to obtain the best advice in framing it;
                                    but I may state that the government are anxious to make it as
                                    plain and emphatic as possible. (<hi rend="italic">Vol. IV,

                                    friends of the disaffected here. The tone of the press and of
                                    private opinion indicated it strongly. I then alluded more
                                    especially to the brief report of the lord chancellor’s speech
                                    on Thursday last, in which he had characterized the rebellious
                                    portion of my country as a belligerent state, and the war that
                                    was going on as <hi rend="italic">justum bellum.</hi></p>
                                <p>To this his lordship replied that he thought more stress was laid
                                    upon these events, than they deserved. The fact was that a
                                    necessity seemed to exist to define the course of the government
                                    in regard to the participation of the subjects of Great Britain
                                    in the impending conflict. To that end, the legal questions
                                    involved had been referred to those officers most conversant
                                    with them, and their advice had been taken in shaping the
                                    result. Their conclusion had been that, as a question merely of
                                        <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, a war existed. A considerable
                                    number of the States, at least seven, occupying a wide extent of
                                    country, were in open resistance, while one or more of the
                                    others” were associating themselves in the same struggle, and as
                                    yet there were no indications of any other result than a contest
                                    of arms more or less severe. In many preceding cases much less
                                    formidable demonstrations had been recognized. Under such
                                    circumstances it seemed scarcely possible to avoid speaking of
                                    this in the technical sense as <hi rend="italic">justum
                                        bellum</hi>, that is, a war of two sides, without in any way
                                    applying an opinion of its justice, as, well as to withhold an
                                    endeavor, so far as possible, to bring the management of it
                                    within the rules of modern civilized warfare. This was all that
                                    was contemplated by the Queen’s proclamation, it was designed to
                                    show the purport of existing laws, and to explain to British
                                    subjects their liabilities in case they should engage in the
                                    war. And however strongly the people of the United States might
                                    feel against their enemies, it was hardly to be supposed that in
                                    practice they would now vary from their uniformly humane policy
                                    heretofore in endeavoring to assuage and mitigate the horrors of
                                    war.</p>
                                <p>To all which I answered that under other circumstances I should

                                    lords-hip’s; but I must be permitted frankly to remark that the
                                    action taken seemed, at least to my mind, a little more rapid
                                    than was absolutely called for by the occasion. It might be
                                    recollected that the new administration had scarcely had sixty
                                    days to develop its policy; that the extent to which <pb n="324"

                                    Government had been demoralized in the preceding administration
                                    was surely understood here, at least in part; that the very
                                    organization upon which any future action was to be predicated
                                    was to be renovated and purified before a hope could be
                                    entertained of energetic and effective labor. The consequence
                                    had been that it was but just emerging from its difficulties,
                                    and beginning to develop the power of the country to cope with
                                    this rebellion, when the British government took the initiative,
                                    and decided practically that it is a struggle of two sides; and,
                                    furthermore, it pronounced the insurgents to be a belligerent
                                    state before they had ever shown their capacity to maintain any
                                    kind of warfare whatever, except within one of their own harbors
                                    and under every possible advantage. It considered them a marine
                                    power before they had ever exhibited a single privateer on the
                                    ocean. I said that I was not aware that a single armed vessel
                                    had yet been issued from any port under the control of these

                                    present insurrection which the President has apprehended is that
                                    of foreign intervention, aid, or sympathy; and especially of

                                    made, namely, on the very day of your arrival in London, which
                                    had been anticipated so far as to provide for your reception by

                                    At the same time it is the purpose of this Government, if

                                    sufficient warrant for continuing to admit the possession of a
                                    belligerent character by a confederation of States which had
                                    been actually dissolved. The late president of the so-called
                                    Confederate States has been captured, and transported as a
                                    prisoner to Fort Monroe; the armies hitherto’ kept in the field
                                    by the Confederate States have, for the most part, surrendered
                                    or dispersed; and to continue to recognize those States as
                                    belligerents would not only be inconsistent with the actual
                                    condition of affairs, but might lead to much embarrassment and
                                    complication in the relations between neutral powers and the

                            withdrawal of the concession of belligerent rights to the rebels, the
                            United States Government were constantly making representations to the
                            British government on this subject. These representations will be found
                            running through the whole correspondence on the subject, as printed in

                        <p>The rights conceded to the rebels were partially withdrawn June 2, 1865,

                        <p>The following extract from a letter from George Bemis, esq., to the
                            Secretary of State, dated Borne, April 20, 1870, directs attention to
                            some of the more important parts of the correspondence contained in the
                            volumes entitled “Claims against Great Britain,” and to some important
                            correspondence not contained in that compilation. This letter was
                            written after the receipt of the second volume, which fact explains some
                            apparent mistakes of the writer: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    only to suggest such deficiencies as have thus far met my eye,

                                    from my own memoranda, to inquire into the care or completeness

                                    winter’s work to that task, leaving in paper-marks and pencil
                                    annotations in the manuscript volumes of the archives, to
                                    facilitate future reference to documents and parts of documents

                                    the United States of North America have unfortunately assumed
                                    the character of open war. Her Majesty, deeply lamenting this
                                    calamitous result, has determined, in common with the other
                                    powers of Europe, to preserve a strict neutrality between the
                                    contending parties;” two documents which I do not find in the

                                <p><hi rend="italic">The Parliamentary announcement of British

                                    Deb., vol. 162, page 1564.) I do not imagine that this has been
                                    overlooked by the compiler, but to rank it among “Debates “as
                                    matter for the appendix, as is perhaps designed, is as, little
                                    allowable as to put the title-page of a volume into its
                                    appendix. Belligerent recognition, in my view, was not effected
                                    by the proclamation of neutrality of May 13, but by what was
                                    done and written May 6, 1861, including, besides this official
                                    parliamentary declaration or speech of Lord Russell, his two

                                    other hand, what was resolved upon and declared by the British
                                    government, at the date of May 6, was diplomatically and
                                    officially communicated to the United States June 15, following;
                                    and (I am sorry to say) to the rebels on or about July 20,

                                    have found, I think, that both Lord Russell and Mr. Seward
                                    consider the communication of British and French recognition of
                                    rebel belligerency to have taken effect, or, at least, been
                                    attempted, in Washington, in the personal interview of the two
                                    foreign ministers with Mr. Seward, June 15, 1861, described in

                                    seems to me, ought in historic fairness, at least, to have made

                                    vehicle of communicating belligerent recognition to the rebel

                                    confederate independence than had been done on the 6th of May.
                                    It is for this reason that I have already ventured in my former

                                    these papers, and my earnest hope, if no scruple of delicacy
                                    toward Mr. Trescot exists on the part of the Government, and no
                                    fear of their exciting national hostilities, that they may be
                                    given to the world. I would add, in respect to these papers,
                                    that Mr. Trescot accompanied them with Southern
                                    newspaper-cuttings, showing the republication in those journals,
                                    in the summer of 1862, of the British parliamentary documents of
                                    May 6, 1861, &amp;c., which cuttings I hope will make a part of
                                    the compilation publication, if such publication of them is ever
                                    to be made; and that Mr. Trescot speaks, in his record
                                    memorandum of the mission, of a long “<hi rend="italic"
                                        >private</hi>” letter of Lord Lyons to Bunch, which, if
                                    procurable, would probably be worth more than all the other
                                    documents put together. I am not certain, however, that Mr.
                                    Trescot did not orally inform Mr. Sanford, through whose
                                    patriotic exertions these valuable documents were secured to the
                                    United States Government, that he had returned this private

                                    mentioning to the honorable Secretary, that Mr. Seward thought
                                    his lordship’s quotation of Canning’s dispatch of the 12th of
                                    October, 1825, (toward the close of the speech)—that in which he
                                    speaks of its being a condition-precedent to any such
                                    belligerent recognition, “that the detention by the searching
                                    vessel is for the purpose of bringing the vessels detained
                                    before an established court of prize, and that confiscation
                                    should not take place until after condemnation by such competent

                                    to obtain the whole of the dispatch quoted; and that Mr. Adams
                                    even applied to Lord Russell personally for that purpose, but

                                        Exequatur</hi>;” what is meant by “<hi rend="italic">Port
                                        Regulations</hi>,” pages xxxiii-xxxvii; and how “<hi

                                        Intervention</hi>” are distinguishable from the current
                                    general title “<hi rend="italic">Recognition of Rebel
                                        Belligerency</hi>.” Nor do I understand exactly why, in the
                                    text and body of the volume from page 517 to the end, the main
                                    title of the volume and the heading of the page “<hi
                                        rend="italic">Claims against Great Britain</hi>" is dropped,
                                    and “<hi rend="italic">Enforcement of Neutrality</hi>” is made
                                    to occupy the heading of the left-hand page, with “<hi
                                        rend="italic">Amendment of Laws”</hi> &amp;c., on the
                                    right-hand side. The Compilation for most purposes would be far
                                    more satisfactory, I am “constrained to think, without any
                                    divisions at all, and with a mere chronological juxtaposition of
                                    documentary pieces, than with such a confusing and misguiding
                                    series of captions and titles. In saying, this I am well aware
                                    that some of these divisions were of my own suggestion; but with
                                    the mechanical arrangement, or rather <hi rend="italic"
                                    >mis</hi>-arrangement, of printing, and still more in the
                                    absence of an explanatory preface, I find that all such
                                    arrangement and distribution of my own has only led to
                                    complicated disorder.</p>
                                <p>But to hasten on with my imperfect catalogue of omissions and
                                    misarrangements under the head of “Recognition of Rebel
                                    Belligerency,” to which I have devoted a more especial

                                    belligerent recognition, which seems to have been overlooked by
                                    the compiler. It is true that both Messrs. Seward’s and Adams’s
                                    entire dispatches’ of October 24 and November 23 are given in

                                    to bring our demand into juxtaposition with Lord Russell’s <hi

                                    characterized as a gratuitous and extraordinary offensive insult
                                    to the Government of the United States.</p>
                                <p>I find that I have omitted to notice in their chronological order
                                    two other important dispatches, or extracts of dispatches, of
                                    the year’1862, relating to the same head of Rebel Belligerency,
                                    which ought to have been repeated, or else differently arranged,
                                    in vol. 1 of the Compilation. The first is <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Seward to Adams, No</hi>. 260, <hi rend="italic">May</hi>
                                    28, 1862, (Dip. Cor., 101,) a dispatch in which Mr. Seward
                                    invoked the element of slavery for the first time, as a ground
                                    for revocation of belligerency, and which dispatch both Messrs.
                                    Seward and Adams regarded as of the highest importance; and the

                                    highly noticeable for Mr. Adams’s report that the <hi

                                    vol. 1 of the Compilation, under the topic, “<hi rend="italic"

                                    lost to the subject of “<hi rend="italic">Recognition</hi>.”

                                    No. 1304, of March 15, (Dip. Cor., 1865, p. 245,) omitted from

                                    Reverdy Johnson’s recent unfounded admissions in that respect. I
                                    ought to notice, perhaps, in reference to the compilation, that
                                    Mr. Adams’s fulfillment of Mr. Seward’s instruction, by way of
                                    communicating this dispatch, is given at page 290 of vol. 1 of
                                    the Compilation, though somewhat varied in terms and recast as

                                    that government from 1862 downward.</p>

                        <p>This branch of the case may be appropriately closed by printing entire

                                the moment was thought not to be the most hopeful to enter upon
                                renewed discussion or negotiation with the government of Great
                                Britain on the subject of the claims of this Government against that
                                of Her Majesty, and you were instructed to convey to Lord Clarendon
                                the opinion of the President that a suspension of the discussion for
                                a short period might allow the subsidence of any excitement or
                                irritation growing out of events then recent, and might enable the
                                two governments to approach more readily to a solution of their
                                differences.</p>
                            <p>You have informed me that Lord Clarendon saw no objection to this
                                course, and agreed with you that it would be well to give time for
                                emotions which had been excited of late to subside. The President is
                                inclined to believe that sufficient time may have now elapsed to
                                allow subsidence of those emotions, and that thus it may be <pb

                                the present conjuncture to place in your hands, for appropriate use,
                                a dispassionate exposition of the just causes of complaint of the
                                Government of the United States against that of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>In order to do this in a satisfactory manner, it is necessary to go
                                back to the very beginning of the acts and events which have in
                                their progress and consummation so much disturbed the otherwise
                                amicable relations of the two governments.</p>
                            <p>When, in the winter of 1860 and 1861, certain States of the American
                                Union undertook by ordinances of secession to separate themselves
                                from the others, and to constitute of their own volition, and by
                                force, a new and independent republic, under the name of the
                                Confederates States of America, there existed as between Great
                                Britain and the United States a condition of profound peace; their
                                political relations were professedly and apparently of the most
                                friendly character, and their commercial and financial relations
                                were as close and intimate in fact as they seemed to be cordial in
                                spirit, such as became the two great, liberal, progressive, and
                                maritime and commercial powers of the world, associated as they were
                                by strong ties of common interest, language, and tradition.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States had no reason to presume that the
                                amicable sentiments of the British government would be diminished,
                                or otherwise prejudicially affected, by the occurrence of domestic
                                insurrection within the United States, any more than those of the
                                latter had been impaired by the occurrence of insurrection in
                                British India, or might be impaired by such occurrence elsewhere in
                                the dominions of Great Britain. Least of all could the Government of
                                the United States anticipate hostility toward it, and special
                                friendship for the insurgents of the seceding States, in view of the
                                inducements and objects of that insurrection, which avowedly, and as
                                every statesman, whether in Europe or America, well knew, and as the
                                very earliest mention of the insurrection in the House of Commons
                                indicated, were the secure establishment of a perpetual and
                                exclusive slave-holding republic. In such a contest the Government
                                of the United States was entitled to expect the earnest good-will,
                                sympathy, and moral support of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>It was with painful astonishment, therefore, that the United States
                                Government received information of the decision of Her Majesty’s
                                government, which had already been made on the 6th day of May, 1861,
                                and was announced on that day, in the House of Commons, by her
                                ministers, and was followed by the issue, on the 13th of May, 1861,
                                of a proclamation, which in effect recognized the insurgents as a
                                belligerent power, and raised them to the same level of neutral
                                right with the United States.</p>
                            <p>The President does not deny, on the contrary he maintains, that every
                                sovereign power decides for itself, on its responsibility, the
                                question whether or not it will, at a given time, accord the status
                                of belligerency to the insurgent subjects of another power, as also
                                the larger question of the independence of such subjects, and their
                                accession to the family of sovereign states.</p>
                            <p>But the rightfulness of such an act depends on the occasion and the
                                circumstances., and it is an act, like the sovereign act of war,
                                which the morality of the public law, and practice requires should
                                be deliberate, seasonable, and just in reference to surrounding
                                facts; national belligerency, indeed, like national independence,
                                being but an existing fact, officially recognized as such; without
                                which such a declaration is only the indirect manifestation of a
                                particular line of policy.</p>
                            <p>The precipitancy of the declaration of the Queen’s government, or, as
                                Mr. Bright characterized it, “the remarkable celerity, undue and
                                unfriendly haste” with which it was made, appears in its having been
                                determined on the 6th of May, four days prior to the arrival in
                                London of any official knowledge of the President’s proclamation,
                                (of April 19, 1861,) by reference to which the Queen’s proclamation
                                has since been defended, and that it was actually signed on the 13th
                                of May, the very day of the arrival of Mr. Adams, the new American
                                minister, as if in the particular aim of forestalling and preventing
                                explanations on the part of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The prematureness of the measure is further shown by the very tenor
                                of the proclamation, which sets forth its own reasons, namely,
                                “Whereas hostilities have unhappily commenced between the Government
                                of the United States of America and certain States styling
                                themselves the Confederate States of America.” Moreover it is not
                                pretended by the proclamation that war exists, but only a “contest,”
                                in reference to which it is not unimportant to note that the
                                language used is such as would fitly apply to parties wholly
                                independent one of the other, so as thus to negative, or to
                                suppress, at least, the critical circumstance, that this bare
                                commencement of hostilities, this incipient contest, was a mere
                                domestic act of insurrection within the United States.</p>
                            <p>But that which conclusively shows the unseasonable precipitancy of
                                the measure is the fact that on that day, May 13, 1861, and indeed
                                until long afterward, not a battle had been fought between the
                                insurgents and the United States, nor a combat even, save the
                                solitary and isolated attack on Fort Sumter. Did such a bare
                                commencement of hostilities constitute belligerency? Plainly
                                not.</p>
                            <p>There was at that time no such thing as a population elevated into
                                force, and by the prosecution of war, which Mr. Canning points out
                                as the test of belligerent condition. <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331"
                                    facs="0389"/>The assumed belligerency of the insurgents was a
                                fiction, a war on paper only, not in the field, like a paper
                                blockade; the. anticipation of supposed belligerency to come, but
                                which might never have come if not thus anticipated and encouraged
                                by the Queen’s government.</p>
                            <p>Indeed, as forcibly put by Mr. Adams, the Queen’s declaration had the
                                effect of creating posterior belligerency, instead of merely
                                acknowledging an actual fact; and that belligerency, so far as it
                                was maritime, proceeding from the ports of Great Britain and her
                                dependencies alone, with aid and co-operation of subjects of Great
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States, that of Great Britain, and other
                                European powers, had repeatedly had occasion to consider this
                                question in all its bearings.</p>
                            <p>It was perceived that the recognition of belligerency on the part of
                                    <hi rend="italic">insurgents</hi>, although not so serious an
                                act as the recognition of independence, yet might well be
                                prejudicial to the legitimate government, and therefore be regarded
                                by it as an act of unfriendliness. It was a step, therefore, to be
                                taken with thoughtfulness, and with due regard to exigent
                                circumstances. Governments had waited months, sometimes years, in
                                the face of actual hostilities, without taking this step. But
                                circumstances might arise to call for it. A ship of the insurgents
                                might appear in the port of the neutral, or a collision might occur
                                at sea, imposing on the neutral the necessity to act; or actual
                                hostilities might have continued to rage in the theater of insurgent
                                war, combat after combat might have been fought for such a period of
                                time, a mass of men may have engaged in actual war until they should
                                have acquired the consistency of military power, to repeat the idea
                                of Mr. Canning, so as evidently to constitute the fact of
                                belligerency, and to justify the recognition by the neutral; or the
                                nearness of the seat of hostilities to the neutral may compel the
                                latter to act. In either of these contingencies the neutral would
                                have a right to act; it might be his sovereign duty to act, however
                                inconvenient such action should be to the legitimate government.
                                There” was no such fact of necessity, no such fact of continued and
                                flagrant existing hostilities, to justify the action of Great
                                Britain in the present case. Hence the United States felt
                                constrained at the time to regard this proclamation as the sign of a
                                purpose of unfriendliness to them, and of friendliness to the
                                insurgents, which purpose could not fail to aggravate all the evils
                                of the pending contest, to strengthen the insurgents, and to
                                embarrass the legitimate government. And so it proved, for as time
                                went on, as the insurrection from political came at length to be
                                military, as the sectional controversy in the United States
                                proceeded to exhibit itself in the organization of great armies and
                                fleets, and in the prosecution of hostilities on a scale of gigantic
                                magnitude, then it was that the spirit of the Queen’s proclamation
                                showed itself in the event; seeing that in virtue of the
                                proclamation maritime enterprises in the ports of Great Britain,
                                which would otherwise have been piratical, were rendered lawful, and
                                thus Great Britain became, and to the end continued to be, the
                                arsenal, the navy-yard, and the treasury of the insurgent
                                confederacy.</p>
                            <p>A spectacle was thus presented without precedent or parallel in the
                                history of civilized nations. Great Britain, although the professed
                                friend of the United States, yet, in time of avowed international
                                peace, permitted armed cruisers to be fitted out and harbored and
                                equipped in her ports, to cruise against the merchant-ships of the
                                United States and to burn and destroy them, until our maritime
                                commerce was swept from the ocean. Our merchant-vessels were
                                destroyed piratically by captors who had no ports of their own in
                                which to refit or to condemn prizes, and whose only nationality was
                                the quarter-deck of their ships, built, dispatched to sea, and not
                                seldom in name, still, professedly owned in Great Gritain. Earl
                                Russell truly said, “It so happens that in this conflict the
                                confederates have no ports, except those of the Mersey and the
                                Clyde, from which they send out ships to cruise against the
                                Federals.” The number of our ships thus directly destroyed amounts
                                to nearly two hundred, and the value of property destroyed to many
                                millions. Indirectly the effect was to increase the rate of
                                insurance in the United States, to diminish exports and imports, and
                                otherwise obstruct domestic industry and production, and to take
                                away from the United States its immense foreign commerce, and to
                                transfer this to the merchant-vessels of Great Britain, so that
                                while in the year 1860 the foreign merchant tonnage of the United
                                States amounted to 2,546,237 tons, in 1866 it had sunk to 1,492,923
                                tons. This depreciation is represented by a corresponding increase
                                in the tonnage of Great Britain during the same period, to the
                                amount of 1,120,650 tons. And the amount of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >commerce</hi> abstracted from the United States and transferred
                                to Great Britain during the same period is in still greater
                                proportion. Thus, in effect, <hi rend="italic">war against the
                                    United States</hi> was carried on from the ports of Great
                                Britain by British subjects in the name of ‘the confederates. Mr.
                                Cobden, in the House of Commons, characterized by these very words
                                the acts permitted or suffered by the British government: “You have
                                been carrying on war from these shores against the United States,”
                                he said, “and have been inflicting an amount of damage on that
                                country greater than would have been produced by many ordinary
                                wars.”</p>
                            <p>The gravity of these facts may be appreciated by considering what had
                                happened at other periods. In the latter period of the war of the
                                French revolution, Great Britain <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                                    facs="0390"/>was compelled to strain every nerve to maintain
                                “herself against the power of Napoleon. In such straits, by a sort
                                of war in disguise, she, trespassed on the rights of neutrals, with
                                special prejudice to the United States, to the result, at length, of
                                solemn war between the two nations. But neither in the events which
                                preceded that war, nor in the events of the war itself, did the
                                United States suffer more at the hands of Great Britain than we did
                                during the late rebellion, by the aid, direct or indirect, which she
                                afforded to the confederated insurgent States; for while on the
                                ocean our merchant marine was destroyed by cruisers sent, out from
                                Great Britain, and our military marine was mainly occupied in
                                watching and counter-working blockade-runners fitted out in Great
                                Britain by official agents of the insurgents, on the land it was in
                                like manner the munitions of war and the wealth drawn by the
                                insurgents from Great Britain which enabled them to withstand, year
                                after year, the arms of the United States. In the midst of all this,
                                remonstrances of the Government of the United States were prompt,
                                earnest, and persistent. Our minister in London appealed to the
                                international amity of the British government; he called on it to
                                discharge its obligations of neutrality; he invoked the aid of the
                                municipal laws of Great Britain. Ample proofs of the wrongs
                                committed were submitted to the Queen’s government. Indeed, these
                                wrongs were open, notorious—perpetrated in the face of day—the
                                subject of debate and of boast, even, in the House of Commons.</p>
                            <p>The Queen’s ministers excused themselves by alleged defects in the
                                municipal law of the country. Learned counsel either advised that
                                the wrongs committed did not constitute violations of the municipal
                                law, or else gave sanction to artful devices of deceit, to cover up
                                such violations of law. And, strange to say, the courts of England
                                or of Scotland, up to the very highest, were occupied month after
                                month with judicial niceties and technicalities of statute
                                construction, in this respect, while the Queen’s government itself,
                                including the omnipotent Parliament, which might have settled these
                                questions in an hour by appropriate legislation, sat with folded
                                arms, as if unmindful of its international obligations, and suffered
                                ship after ship to be constructed in its ports to wage war on the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>We hold that the international duty of the Queen’s government in this
                                respect was above and independent of the municipal laws of England.
                                It was a sovereign duty attaching to Great Britain as a sovereign
                                power. The municipal law was but a means of repressing or punishing
                                individual wrong-doers. The law of nations was the true and proper
                                rule of duty for the government. If the municipal laws were
                                defective, that was a domestic inconvenience, of concern only to the
                                local government, and for it to remedy or not by suitable
                                legislation, as it pleased. But no sovereign power can rightfully
                                plead the defects of its own domestic penal statutes as
                                justification or extenuation of an international wrong to another
                                sovereign power. When the defects of the existing laws of Parliament
                                had become apparent, the Government of the United States earnestly
                                entreated the Queen’s minister to provide the required remedy, as it
                                would have been easy to do by a proper act of Parliament; but this
                                the Queen's government refused.</p>
                            <p>The United States, at an early day in their history, had set the
                                example of repressing violations of neutrality to the prejudice of
                                Great Britain by their own authority, and in the discharge of their
                                own national duty, without waiting for the assistance of municipal
                                statute. They afterward enacted such statutes for their own
                                convenience, and as attestation of their good faith toward other
                                nations. And on special occasions, when defects were perceived in
                                such laws, we enacted new ones to meet the case, not; deeming that
                                such legislation was derogatory to our public dignity; but, on the
                                contrary, conceiving that in so doing we best consulted the highest
                                dictates of national dignity, self-respect, and public honor. And if
                                Great Britain had so understood her national duty on this occasion,
                                she would have done much to save the two countries from the present
                                controversy and all its possible consequences.</p>
                            <p>Once before, in its intercourse with the United States, the Queen’s
                                government had fallen into the error of assuming that municipal laws
                                constitute the measure of international rights and obligations; that
                                is to say, when official agents of the British government attempted
                                to enlist military recruits in the neutral countries of Prussia, the
                                United States, and elsewhere, for service against Russia, on the
                                hypothesis that, if the prohibitions of municipal law could be
                                evaded, that would suffice, overlooking the paramount consideration
                                of the respect due to the sovereign rights of the neutral power.</p>
                            <p>So, on the present occasion, the Queen’s ministers seem to have
                                committed the error of assuming that they needed not to look beyond
                                their own local law, enacted for their own domestic convenience, and
                                might, under cover of the deficiencies of that law, disregard their
                                sovereign duties toward another sovereign power. Nor was it, in our
                                judgment, any adequate excuse for the Queen’s ministers to profess
                                extreme tenderness of private rights, or apprehension of actions for
                                damages, in case of any attempt to arrest the many ships which,
                                either in England or Scotland, were with ostentatious publicity
                                being constructed to cruise against the United States.</p>
                            <p>Surely, that was an imaginary difficulty; or if a real one, it
                                presented the election <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0391"
                                />between a serious complication of relations with the United States
                                and the hazard of a legal conflict with John Laird and Charles Kuhn
                                Prioleau.</p>
                            <p>But the Government of the United States has never been able to see
                                the force of this alleged difficulty. The common law of England is
                                the common law of the United States. In both countries, and
                                certainly in England, revenue seizures are made daily, and ships
                                prevented from going to sea on much Jess cause of suspicion than
                                attached to the suspected ships of the confederates.</p>
                            <p>In both countries, and not least in England, the previous order of
                                the government, or its subsequent approval, covers the acts of the
                                subordinate officers. In both countries, or if not in England
                                assuredly in the United States, under municipal laws in this behalf
                                substantially the same, the Government finds no difficulty in
                                arresting ships charged with actual or intended violation of the
                                sovereign rights or neutral duties of the States.</p>
                            <p>Signal examples of this occur in the history of the United Stages.
                                Thus, during the late war between Great Britain and Russia, on
                                complaints with affidavits being filed by the British consul at New
                                York, charging that the bark Maury was being equipped there as a
                                belligerent cruiser, and this on far less evidence than that which
                                the American consul at Liverpool exhibited against the Alabama, the
                                bark Maury was arrested within an hour by telegraphic order from
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>Other examples of the same decision and promptitude, in maintenance
                                of the sovereign rights and discharge of the neutral duties of the
                                United States, have occurred, as is well known, under both the last
                                and present administrations.</p>
                            <p>Nay, at every period of our history, the Government of the United
                                States has not, been “content, with preventing the-departure of
                                ships fitted out in violation of neutrality, and of putting a stop
                                to military recruitments and expeditions of the same nature, but has
                                further manifested its good faith and its respect for its own
                                sovereignty and laws by prosecuting criminally the guilty parties.
                                Examples of this occur in the early stages of the war of the French
                                revolution, on occasions of the insurrection of the Spanish-American
                                continental provinces and of revolutionary movements in the
                                Spanish-American republics, and on various other occasions,
                                including the existing insurrection in Cuba.</p>
                            <p>But although such acts of violation of law were frequent in Great
                                Britain, and susceptible of complete technical proof, notorious,
                                flaunted directly in the face of the world, varnished over, if at
                                all, with the shallowest pretext of deception, yet no efficient step
                                appears to have been taken by the British government to enforce the
                                execution of its municipal laws or to vindicate the majesty of its
                                outraged sovereign power.</p>
                            <p>And the Government of the United States cannot believe—it would
                                conceive itself wanting in respect for Great Britain to impute—that
                                the Queen’s ministers are so much hampered by judicial difficulties
                                that the local administration is thus reduced to such a state of
                                legal impotency as to deprive the government of capacity to uphold
                                its sovereignty against local wrong-doers, or its neutrality as
                                regards other sovereign powers.</p>
                            <p>If, indeed, it were so, the causes of reclamation on the part of the
                                United States would only be the more positive and sure; for the law
                                of nations assumes that each government is capable of discharging
                                its international obligations; and, perchance, if it be not, then
                                the absence of such capability is itself a specific ground of
                                responsibility for consequences.</p>
                            <p>But the Queen’s government would not be content to admit, nor will
                                the Government of the United States presume to impute to it, such
                                political organization of the British empire as to imply any want of
                                legal ability on its part to discharge, in the amplest manner, all
                                its duties of sovereignty and amity toward other powers.</p>
                            <p>It remains only in this relation to refer to one other point, namely,
                                the question of <hi rend="italic">negligence;</hi> neglect on the
                                part of officers of the British government, whether superior or
                                subordinate, to detain confederate cruisers, and especially the
                                Alabama, the most successful of the depredators on the commerce of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>On this point the President conceives that little needs now to be
                                said, for various cogent reasons.</p>
                            <p>First, the matter has been exhaustively discussed already by this
                                Department, or by the successive American ministers.</p>
                            <p>Then, if the question of negligence be discussed with frankness, it
                                must be treated in this instance as a ease of extreme negligence,
                                which Sir William Jones has taught us to regard as equivalent or
                                approximate to evil intention. The question of negligence,
                                therefore, cannot be presented without danger of thought or language
                                disrespectful toward the Queen’s ministers, and the President, while
                                purposing, of course, as his sense of duty requires, to sustain the
                                rights of the United States in all their utmost amplitude, yet
                                intends to speak and act in relation to Great Britain in the same
                                spirit of international respect which he expects of her in relation
                                to the United States, and he is sincerely desirous that all
                                discussions between the governments may be so conducted as not only
                                to prevent any aggravation of existing differences, but to tend to
                                such reasonable and amicable determination as best becomes two great
                                nations of common origin and conscious dignity and strength.</p>
                            <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0392"/>
                            <p>I assume, therefore, pretermitting detailed discussion in this
                                respect, that the negligence of the officers of the British
                                government in the matter of the Alabama, at least, was gross and
                                inexcusable, and such as indisputably to devolve on that government
                                full responsibility for all the depredations committed by her.
                                Indeed, this conclusion seems in effect to be conceded in Great
                                Britain. At all events, the United States conceive that the proofs
                                of responsible negligence in this matter are so clear that no room
                                remains for debate on that point, and it should be taken for granted
                                in all future negotiations with Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>It is impossible not to compare and contrast the conduct of the
                                States General, as regards Great Britain on occasion of the revolt
                                of the British colonies, with that of Great Britain as regards the
                                insurrection in the Southern States. No fleets were fitted out by
                                America in the ports of the Netherlands to prey on the commerce of
                                Great Britain. Only in a single instance did American cruisers have
                                temporary harborage in the Texel. Year after year the exports of
                                munitions of war for the Netherlands were forbidden by the States
                                General, the more completely to fulfill their duty of amity and
                                neutrality toward Great Britain; but, nevertheless, Great Britain
                                treated a declaration of neutrality by the States General, and the
                                observance of that declaration, as a sufficient cause of war against
                                the Netherlands; prior to which the British government continually
                                complained of the occasional supplies derived by the colonies from
                                the island of St. Eustatius. How light, in this respect, would have
                                been the burdens of the United States during the late insurrection
                                if British aid had been confined to a contraband commerce between
                                the insurgents and the port of Nassau.</p>
                            <p>Not such is the complaint of the United States against Great Britain.
                                We complain that the insurrection in the Southern States, if it did
                                not exist, was continued, and obtained its enduring vitality, by
                                means of the resources it drew from Great Britain. We complain that
                                by reason of the imperfect discharge of its neutral duties on the
                                part of the Queen’s government, Great Britain became the military,
                                naval, and financial basis of insurgent warfare against the United
                                States. We complain of the destruction of our merchant-marine by
                                British ships manned by British seamen, armed with British guns,
                                dispatched from British dock-yards, sheltered and harbored in
                                British ports. We complain that, by reason of the policy and the
                                acts of the Queen’s ministers, injury incalculable was inflicted on
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the United States manfully and resolvedly encountered
                                all the great perils and difficulties of the situation, foreign and
                                domestic, and overcame them. We endured, with proud patience, the
                                manifestation of hostility there, where we had expected friendship,
                                in England, the protagonist of the abolition of negro servitude, in
                                order to perpetuate which the Southern States had seceded from the
                                Union. We entered on a great war, involving sea and land; we marched
                                to the field hundreds of thousands of soldiers and expended
                                thousands of millions of treasure for their support; we lavished the
                                blood of our bravest and best in battle, as if it were but water; we
                                submitted to all privations without a murmur; we staked our lives,
                                our fortunes, and our honor on the issue of the combat; and, by the
                                blessing of God, we came out of the deadly struggle victorious, and
                                with courage proved, strength unimpaired, power augmented, and our
                                place fixed among the nations second to none, we may without
                                presumption say, in the civilized world. Providence had smiled On
                                our sacrifices and our exertions; and in the hour of supreme triumph
                                we felt that, while mindful of goodwill shown us by friendly powers
                                in the hour of trial, we could afford to account in moderation with
                                others, which, like Great Britain, had, as we thought, speculated
                                improvidently, and to their own discomfiture, on the expected
                                dismemberment and downfall of the great American republic.</p>
                            <p>As to Great Britain, we had special and peculiar causes of grief. She
                                had prematurely, as we deemed it, and without adequate reason,
                                awarded the status of belligerency to our insurgents. But this act
                                of itself, and by its inherent nature, was of neutral color, and an
                                act which, howsoever we might condemn it in the particular case, we
                                could not deny to be of the competency of a sovereign state. Other
                                European governments also recognized the belligerency of the
                                insurgent s; but Great Britain alone had translated a measure
                                indefinite of itself into one of definite wrong to the United
                                States; as evinced by the constant and efficient aid in ships and
                                munitions of war which she furnished the confederates, and in the
                                permission or negligence which enabled confederate cruisers from her
                                ports to prey on the commerce of the United States. Great Britain
                                alone had founded on that recognition a systematic maritime war
                                against the United States. And this, to effect the establishment of
                                a slave government; as to which Mr. Bright might well say, “We
                                supply the ships; we supply the arms, the munitions of war; we give
                                aid and comfort to the foulest of crimes; <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Englishmen only</hi> do it.” Thus, what in France, in Spain, as
                                their subsequent conduct showed, had been but an untimely and
                                ill-judged act of political manifestation, had in England, as her
                                subsequent conduct showed, been a virtual act of war. We reflected
                                that the confederates had no ships, no means of building ships, no
                                mechanical appliances, no marine, no legal <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status</hi> on the sea, no open sea-ports, no possible courts
                                of prize, no domestic command of the instruments and agencies of
                                modern maritime warfare. We asked ourselves what would the Queen’s
                                government <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0393"/>have said if the
                                United-States had awarded the rights of belligerency to insurgents
                                in India, or in Ireland, in the same circumstances, that is, on the
                                occurrence of a single act of rebel hostility, and had bestowed upon
                                them their only means of maritime as well as territorial warfare
                                against Great Britain?</p>
                            <p>In truth, while, in the hour of their great triumph, the United
                                States were thankfully inclined to sentiments of moderation, both at
                                home and abroad—for at home no man has suffered death for political
                                causes—were the more inclined to moderation, especially, as regards
                                Great Britain, in view of the very enormity of the wrongs we had
                                sustained, and the consequent difficulty of measuring the reparation
                                due, even if sincerely proffered by the Queen’s government—we
                                desired no war with England; we shrank from the thought of another
                                lustrum of fratricidal carnage, like that through which we had just
                                passed, with no change in the conditions of war but the
                                substitution, on one side, of misguided Englishmen in the place of
                                misguided Americans. “We preferred, if possible, to find some
                                satisfaction of our great grievances by peaceful means, consistent
                                alike with the honor of Great Britain and of the United States. The
                                influence of this condition of mind is apparent in all the
                                discussions of the subject by or under the instruction of this
                                Department during preceding administrations of the Government. It
                                resulted in earnest efforts on our part to determine the controversy
                                by arbitration in the interest of peace and of international
                                good-will, which efforts, if promptly met by the Queen’s ministers
                                in the spirit in which they were made, would long since have removed
                                the present controversy from the fields of diplomacy, and
                                effectually harmonized the relations of the United States with Great
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>But the amicable advances of the United States to dispose of the
                                question by arbitration were at the start, and persistently long
                                afterward, met by Lord Russell, in the name of the Queen’s
                                government, with subtleties of reservation and exception, the effect
                                of which would have been, instead of closing up the controversy, to
                                leave us in a condition worse than before, and more perilous to the
                                cause of peace.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States has never been able to appreciate
                                the force of the reasons alleged in support of such reservations and
                                exceptions. When one power demands of another the redress of alleged
                                wrongs, and the latter entertains the idea of arbitration as the
                                means of settling the question, it seems irrational to insist that
                                the arbitration shall be a qualified and limited one, through
                                apprehensions lest, peradventure, there might thus be implication
                                that such wrongs had been committed by intention, and that such
                                implication would be injurious to the honor of the wrong-doing
                                government. On these premises arbitration may be the means of
                                adjusting immaterial international wrongs, but not of material ones;
                                that is to say, if the grievances be serious, the two nations must
                                of necessity go to war, while-neither desires it, which would be an
                                absurd conclusion.</p>
                            <p>Lord Stanley and Lord Clarendon appear to have seen this, and
                                therefore to have regarded the particular question with more correct
                                estimation of its incidents than Lord Russell, and thereupon to have
                                admitted as theory comprehensive arbitration concerning all
                                questions between the governments.</p>
                            <p>But the convention, which in this view was negotiated by the Earl of
                                Clarendon and Mr. Reverdy Johnson, did not prove satisfactory to the
                                Senate of the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is well known to the government of Great Britain that the
                                President and the Senate of the United States aro distinct powers of
                                the Government, associated in the conclusion of treaties and in the
                                appointment of public officers, but not dependent one on the other,
                                nor of necessity entertaining the same opinion on public questions.
                                Each acts on appropriate convictions of duty and of right, and the
                                Senate has the same absolute power to reject a treaty as the
                                President has to negotiate one.</p>
                            <p>Of course it is not necessarily incumbent on the President to express
                                approval or disapproval of an act of the Senate.</p>
                            <p>But the President deems it due to the Senate, to himself, and to the
                                subject, to declare that he concurs with the Senate in disapproving
                                of that convention. His own particular reasons for his conclusion
                                are sufficiently apparent in this dispatch. In addition to these
                                general reasons, he thinks the provisions of the convention were
                                inadequate to provide reparation for the United States in the manner
                                and to the degree to which he considers the United States entitled
                                to redress. Other and special reasons for the same conclusions have
                                been explained in a previous dispatch—such, namely, as the time and
                                circumstances of the negotiation, the complex character of the
                                proposed arbitration, its chance, agency, and results, and its
                                failure to determine any principle, or otherwise to fix on a stable
                                foundation the relations of the two governments.</p>
                            <p>The President is not yet prepared to pronounce on the question of the
                                indemnities which he thinks due by Great Britain to individual
                                citizens of the United States, for the destruction of their property
                                by rebel cruisers fitted out in the ports of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>Nor is he now prepared to speak of the reparation which he thinks due
                                by the British government for the larger account of the vast <hi
                                    rend="italic">national</hi> injuries it has inflicted on the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>Nor does he attempt now to measure the relative effect of the various
                                causes of injury, as whether by untimely recognition of
                                belligerency, by suffering the fitting out of rebel <pb n="336"
                                    xml:id="pg_336" facs="0394"/>cruisers, or by the supply of
                                ships, arms, and munitions of war to the confederates, or otherwise,
                                in whatsoever manner.</p>
                            <p>Nor does it fall within the scope of this dispatch to discuss the
                                important changes in the rules of public law, the desirableness of
                                which has been demonstrated by the incidents of the last few years
                                now under consideration, and which, in view of the maritime
                                prominence of Great Britain and the United States, it would befit
                                them to mature, and propose to the other states of Christendom.</p>
                            <p>All these are subjects of future consideration; which, when the time
                                for action shall arrive, the President will consider with sincere
                                and earnest desire that all differences between the two nations may
                                be adjusted amicably and compatibly with the honor of each, and to
                                the promotion of future concord between them; to which end ‘he will
                                spare no effort within the range of his supreme duty to the rights
                                and interest of the United States.</p>
                            <p>At the present stage of the controversy, the sole object of the
                                President is to state the position and maintain the attitude of the
                                United States in the various relations and aspects of this grave
                                controversy with Great Britain. It is the object of this paper
                                (which you are at liberty to read to Lord Clarendon) to state calmly
                                and dispassionately, with a more unreserved freedom than might be
                                used in one addressed directly to the Queen’s government, what this
                                Government seriously considers the injuries she has suffered. It is
                                not written in the nature of a claim, for the United States now make
                                no demand against her Majesty’s government on account of the
                                injuries they feel that they have sustained.</p>
                            <p>Although the United States are anxious for a settlement on a liberal
                                and comprehensive basis of all the questions which now interfere
                                with the entirely cordial relations which they desire to exist
                                between the two governments, they do not now propose or desire to
                                set any time for this settlement. On the contrary, they prefer to
                                leave that question, and also the more important question of the
                                means and method of removing the causes of complaint, of restoring
                                the much desired relations of perfect cordiality, and the preventing
                                of the probability of like questions in the future, to the
                                consideration of her Majesty’s government. They will, however, be
                                ready, whenever her Majesty’s government shall think the proper time
                                has come for a renewed negotiation, to entertain any proposition
                                which that government shall think proper to present, and to apply to
                                such propositions their earnest and sincere wishes and endeavors for
                                a solution honorable and satisfactory to both countries.</p>

                                <p>Mr. Fish recapitulates the arguments previously used by Mr.
                                    Seward as to the “precipitate recognition “of belligerent
                                    rights, which, he says, “appears in its having been determined
                                    on the 6th of May, four days prior to the arrival in London of
                                    any official knowledge of the President’s proclamation of the
                                    19th of April, 1861.” * * * * and “signed on the 13th of May—the
                                    very day of the arrival of Mr. Adams, the new American minister,
                                    as if in the particular aim of forestalling and preventing
                                    explanations on the part of the United States.”</p>
                                <p>The facts are—</p>
                                <p>The President’s proclamation of blockade was published April 19.
                                    Intelligence of its issue was received by telegraph (see the
                                    Times) on the 2d of May.</p>
                                <p>It was published in the Daily News and other papers on the 3d of
                                    May. Mr. Seward, in his dispatch to Mr. Adams of the 12th of
                                    January, 1867, says, “it reached London on the 3d of May.”</p>
                                <p>A copy was received officially from her Majesty’s consul at New
                                    York on the 5th; another copy, from Lord Lyons, on the 10th.</p>
                                <p>It was communicated officially by Mr. Dallas to Lord Russell on
                                    the 11th, with a copy of a circular from Mr. Seward to the
                                    United States ministers abroad, dated the 20th of April, calling
                                    attention to it, and stating the probability that attempts would
                                    be made to “fit out privateers in the ports of England for the
                                    purpose of aggression on the commerce of the United States.”</p>
                                <p>The reason of the delay in receiving the copy from Washington was
                                    in itself a proof of the existence of civil war, arising, as it
                                    did, from the communication between <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"

                                    consequence of the confederate troops threatening the
                                    capital.</p>
                                <p>The prematureness of the measure is further shown by the very
                                    tenor of the proclamation: “Whereas hostilities have unhappily
                                    commenced between the Government of the United States of America
                                    and certain States styling themselves the Confederate States of
                                    America.” Exception is also taken to the use of the word
                                    “contest” as distinct from “war.”</p>
                                <p>It will be seen, on referring to the report of the royal
                                    commission for inquiring into the neutrality laws, (Appendix,)
                                    that the form of words used is taken from previous
                                    proclamations: “Whereas hostilities at this time exist,” (June
                                    6, 1823;) “engaged in a contest,” (September 30, 1825, Turkey
                                    and Greece;) “Whereas hostilities have unhappily commenced,”
                                    (May 13, 1859, Austria, France, and Italy.) The same form was
                                    used in the case of Spain and Chili, (February 6, 1866,) and
                                    Spain and Peru, (March 13, 1866.) “Hostilities have unhappily
                                    commenced,” (Austria, Prussia. Italy, Germany, June 27,
                                    1866.)</p>
                                <p>The order prohibiting prizes from being brought into British
                                    ports, for which the United States Government thanked the
                                    British government, as being likely to give a death-blow to
                                    privateering, speaks of “observing the strictest neutrality in
                                    the contest which appears to be imminent,” (June 1, 1861.)</p>
                                <p>It is remarkable that in the case of Turkey and Greece, British
                                    subjects were warned to respect “the exercise of belligerent
                                    rights.” This is omitted in the United States case, the
                                    belligerents being spoken of as “the contending parties.”</p>
                                <p>The expression, “States styling themselves the Confederate States
                                    of America,” was purposely adopted to avoid the recognition of
                                    their existence as independent States, and gave them great
                                    offense.</p>
                                <p>The French proclamation of the 10th of June has “la lutte engagée
                                    entre le Gouvernement de l'Union et les Etats prétendent former
                                    une Confédération particulière.”</p>
                                <p>The Spanish proclamation, which the United States minister at
                                    Madrid (see Diplomatic Correspondence laid before Congress,
                                    1861, p. 224) informed the Spanish government “the President had
                                    read with the greatest satisfaction,” issued on the 17th of
                                    June, 1861, has “Confederate States of the South,” and uses the
                                    term “belligerent” three times over.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Fish’s dispatch states that the “assumed belligerency” was a
                                    “fiction,” the “anticipation of supposed belligerency to come,
                                    but which might never have come if not thus anticipated and
                                    encouraged by the Queen’s government.”</p>
                                <p>What are the facts? A large group of States, containing a
                                    population of several millions, and comprising a compact
                                    geographical area, enabling them to act readily in concert, had
                                    established a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government, with a
                                    president, congress, constitution, courts of justice, army, and
                                    all the machinery of military and civil power. They possessed
                                    the ports along upward of 2,000 miles of coast; with the
                                    exception of Forts Pickens and Monroe, all the Federal posts and
                                    forts had been evacuated, including Harper’s Ferry, the arsenal
                                    of the Potomac Valley. Fort Sumter, the only one which had
                                    offered resistance, had fallen a month previously, April 13. The
                                    confederate troops were in occupation of the Shenandoah lines,
                                    and threatening Washington. The confederate president had
                                    declared war, and called for a levy of 32,000 troops, to which
                                    all the seceded States had responded promptly. On the other
                                    hand, the Federal President had called for 75,000 volunteers on
                                    the 15th of April, and for 42,000 more on the 3d of May; and as
                                    fast as the regiments could be armed they were hurrying to the
                                    defense of Washington. The contending armies were, indeed, face
                                    to face.</p>
                                <p>So much for the hostilities on land. The operations at sea, in
                                    which British interests were more directly affected, had been
                                    carried on with equal vigor. On the 17th of April the
                                    confederate president issued his proclamation offering to grant
                                    letters of marque, which was followed, two days afterward, by
                                    the Federal proclamation of blockade. At the date of the Queen’s
                                    proclamation of neutrality both these had been carried, or were
                                    being carried, into effect. The Federal Government had
                                    instituted the blockade of Virginia and North Carolina, which
                                    was declared to be effective on the 30th of April, and were
                                    rapidly dispatching all the merchant-vessels which they could
                                    procure, and which they were able to convert into ships-of-war,
                                    to the blockade of the other ports. The General Parkhill, of
                                    Liverpool, was captured by the United States ship Niagara while
                                    attempting to run the blockade of Charleston, on the 12th of
                                    May; and the British vessels Hilja and Monmouth warned off on
                                    the same day. Confederate privateers were already at sea. One
                                    was captured at the mouth of the Chesapeake River on the 8th of
                                    May by the United States ship Harriet Lane. On the 15th the
                                    Federal bark Ocean Eagle, of Rockhead, Maine, was taken by the
                                    confederate privateer Calhoun off New Orleans. At the same port
                                    Captain Semmes had already received his commission, and was
                                    engaged in the outfit of the Sumter.</p>
                                <p>Could any explanations which Mr. Adams might have had to offer
                                    alter such a state of things as this? Can any other name be
                                    given to it than that of civil war?</p>

                                <p>It is stated that there was no fact of continued and flagrant
                                    “hostilities" to justify the action of Great Britain in issuing
                                    a proclamation of neutrality. Mr. Seward writing at the time,
                                    and previously to the Queen’s proclamation, (May 4,)
                                    characterized the proceedings of the confederates as “open,
                                    flagrant, deadly war,” and as “civil war,” (Congress Papers,
                                    1861, page 165;) and in a communication to M. de Tassara, the
                                    Spanish minister, referred to the operations of the Federal
                                    blockade as belligerent operations which would be carried on
                                    with due respect to the rights of neutrals.</p>
                                <p>Judge Betts, in the cases of the Hiawatha, &amp;c., said: “I
                                    consider that the outbreak in particular States, as also in the
                                    confederated States, was an open and flagrant civil war.”</p>
                                <p>It is also judicially decided by the Supreme Court of the United
                                    States, in the ease of the Amy Warwick and other prizes, that
                                    “the proclamation of blockade is itself official and conclusive
                                    evidence that a state of war existed which demanded and
                                    authorized such a measure.” Moreover, the joint resolution of
                                    Congress, in July, 1861, approving and confirming the acts of
                                    the President, (North America, No. 1, 1862,” page 57,)
                                    commences: “Whereas, since the adjournment of Congress on the
                                    4th of March last, a formidable insurrection in certain States
                                    of this Union has arrayed itself in armed hostility;” and a
                                    resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d of July,
                                    1861, speaks of the “present deplorable civil war” and of "this
                                    war.”</p>
                                <p>The date at which the civil war actively commenced has,
                                    therefore, been fixed by the published dispatches of the
                                    Secretary of State, by proceedings in Congress, by the formal
                                    judgment of the United States prize-courts, as well as by the
                                    universal assent of all the neutral powers concerned; but it is
                                    urged that, nevertheless, there was no necessity for Great
                                    Britain to take notice of it, as no ship of the insurgents had
                                    appeared in British ports, no collision occurred at sea, nor did
                                    the nearness of Great Britain to the seat of hostilities compel
                                    her to act.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the latter point, it is difficult to see how one
                                    nation can be much nearer to another than England to the United
                                    States, seeing that the British dominions, touch the United
                                    States on two sides, while the British islands of New
                                    Providence, &amp;c., lie immediately in front. As to a collision
                                    at sea, it was apparent that British commerce must be interfered
                                    with the moment the blockade came into operation, as indeed was
                                    the case, several British vessels having been captured before
                                    there was time for the intelligence of the proclamation of
                                    neutrality to reach America. As to the arrival of confederate
                                    ships in British ports, such ships were afloat and might at any
                                    time be expected. As Mr. Dana, in the notes to the eighth
                                    edition of Wheaton, expresses it, (p. 35,) “it is not fit that
                                    cases should be left to be decided as they may arise, by private
                                    citizens, or naval or judicial officers, at home or abroad, by
                                    sea or land.”</p>
                                <p>The British government were compelled to take action of some
                                    sort. Was that action really unfriendly; was it intended to be
                                    unfriendly?</p>
                                <p>No one who recollects what actually passed, or will consult
                                    “Hansard,” can suppose that the proclamation was intended to be
                                    unfriendly. On the contrary, as was stated by Mr. Forster in his
                                    speech at Bradford, it was absolutely pressed upon the
                                    government by the friends of the Northern States, who were
                                    afraid lest confederate privateers, should be fitted out in
                                    British ports.</p>
                                <p>Nor was its immediate result injurious to the Federal States. Far
                                    from being so, it legitimatized the captures of the blockading
                                    squadron, and, in the language of the prize-court, “estopped”
                                    the British merchants, whose vessels were seized, from making
                                    reclamation.</p>
                                <p>While the intelligence of the issue of the Queen’s proclamation
                                    was still fresh, and almost immediately after hearing of the
                                    French and Spanish proclamations of neutrality, the President,
                                    in his message of the 4th of July, 1861, stated that he was
                                    “happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the United
                                    States are now practically respected by foreign powers, and a
                                    general sympathy with the country is manifested.’ throughout the
                                    world.”</p>
                                <p>Does any one really believe that the Queen’s proclamation in the
                                    very least influenced the movements of the confederate armies?
                                    All the preparations for war had been made long before,
                                    munitions collected, troops levied, and generals appointed. The
                                    proclamation reached America at the end of May, by which time
                                    the confederates had taken up their position on the Upper
                                    Potomac, and the Federals had occupied Alexandria, in Virginia,
                                    with a force of thirteen thousand men, May 24.</p>
                                <p>The armies on both sides were in motion; skirmishes were daily
                                    occurring; engagements took place at Little Bethel on the 10th
                                    of June, at Carthage, Missouri, on the 6th of July, and at
                                    Centreville on the 18th, followed by the great battle of
                                    Manassas Junction on the 21st. Can any one suppose that if the
                                    proclamation had not been issued that battle would not have been
                                    fought?</p>
                                <p>The charge of premature recognition, on examination, reduces
                                    itself to this, that the proclamation ought not to have been
                                    issued until Mr. Adams arrived, or until some event called for
                                    it. Against this is to be set the fact that the proclamation was
                                    considered by some friends of the Northern States as a step
                                    taken in their interests and <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"

                                    by Mr. Dallas’s communication of Mr. Seward’s circular.
                                    Moreover, confederate privateers were at sea, and British
                                    vessels being made prizes by the Federal blockading fleet.</p>
                                <p>Besides the assertion of the premature recognition of belligerent
                                    rights, the dispatch states that maritime enterprises in the
                                    ports of Great Britain which would otherwise have been piratical
                                    were, “by virtue of the proclamation,” rendered lawful, “and
                                    thus Great Britain became, and to the end continued to be, the
                                    arsenal, the navy-yard, and the treasury of the insurgent
                                    confederacy.”</p>
                                <p>Mr. Fish, in a preceding passage, admits that national
                                    belligerency is “an existing fact,” and he might Lave added that
                                    it exists independently of any official proclamations of neutral
                                    powers, as is shown by the records of the American prize-courts,
                                    which continually recognize the belligerency of the South
                                    American States; although, as Mr. Seward stated in one of his
                                    dispatches, the United States have never issued a proclamation
                                    of neutrality except in the case of France and England, in 1793.
                                    This was proved in the civil war by the reception at Curaçoa of
                                    the confederate vessel Sumter as a belligerent cruiser, though
                                    the Netherlands had issued no proclamation of neutrality. It was
                                    this recognition of the Sumter, after her departure from New
                                    Orleans, (July 6, 1861,) at Curaçoa, and at Cienfuegos, which
                                    first practically accorded maritime belligerent rights to the
                                    confederates, a fact which is overlooked when it is alleged that
                                    confederate “belligerency, so far as it was maritime,” proceeded
                                    "from the ports of Great Britain and her dependencies
                                    alone.”</p>
                                <p>Indeed, it is not going too far to say that the confederates
                                    derived no direct benefit from the proclamation. Their
                                    belligerency depended upon the fact (a fact which, when we are
                                    told that the civil war left behind it two millions and a half
                                    of dead and maimed, is unfortunately indisputable) that they
                                    were waging civil war. If there had been no proclamation, the
                                    fact would have remained the same, and belligerency would have
                                    had to be recognized either on behalf of the Northern States by
                                    admitting the validity of captures on the high seas for the
                                    carriage of contraband or breach of blockade, or on the arrival
                                    of the Sumter, or some similar vessel, in a British port.</p>
                                <p>In no case can it be really supposed that the recognition of
                                    belligerency, which, unless neutral nations abandoned their
                                    neutrality and took an active part in the contest, was
                                    inevitable, materially influenced the fortunes of such a fearful
                                    and protracted civil war.</p>
                                <p>At all events, if it did, the confederates never acknowledged it;
                                    the recognition of belligerency they regarded (as indeed was the
                                    case) as a right which could not be denied to them. What they
                                    sought was not the mere technical title of “belligerents,” but a
                                    recognition of independence; and when they found that it was
                                    hopeless to expect England to accord it, they cut off all
                                    intercourse with this country, expelled her Majesty’s consuls
                                    from their towns, and did everything in their power to show the
                                    sense which they entertained of the injury which they believed
                                    had been inflicted upon them. The result being that, while one
                                    side has blamed us for doing too much, the other side has blamed
                                    us for doing too little; and thus an assumption of neutrality
                                    has been regarded both by North and South as an attitude of
                                    hostility.</p>
                                <p>As to the Queen’s proclamation, rendering lawful the dispatch of
                                    the Alabama, Shenandoah, and Georgia, from British ports, to
                                    which it is to be presumed the expression “maritime enterprise”
                                    refers, it is to be remarked that it is exactly against such
                                    enterprises that the proclamation reciting the terms of the
                                    foreign enlistment act was intended to warn British subjects.
                                    Instead of rendering them lawful, it rendered them additionally
                                    unlawful, by giving notice of their illegality.</p>
                                <p>There would be no difficulty in showiug by precedents from
                                    American prize-courts that no proclamation of neutrality is
                                    required to confer belligerent rights on vessels commissioned by
                                    a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government.</p>
                                <p>It is admitted that at the time these “enterprises” were
                                    undertaken “hostilities” in America were being prosecuted “on a
                                    scale of gigantic magnitude.” After, therefore, the Alabama
                                    escaped on the 29th of July, 1862, she became, by virtue of her
                                    confederate commission, undoubtedly a belligerent cruiser,
                                    irrespective of any acknowledgment of belligerency by Great
                                    Britain, and was received accordingly by the French authorities
                                    at Martinique, where she first touched after leaving
                                    Liverpool.</p>
                                <p>A pirate is <hi rend="italic">hostis humani generis</hi>, one
                                    owing obedience to no authority. If the Alabama had been really
                                    a pirate depredating on American commerce, it would have been
                                    the duty of the French to seize her and execute justice on her
                                    commander and crew, a pirate being triable wheresoever
                                    found.</p>
                                <p>Judge Nelson, in the case of the confederate privateer Savannah,
                                    ruled that though confederate privateers were pirates <hi
                                        rend="italic">quoad</hi> American jurisdiction, they were
                                    not pirates <hi rend="italic">jure gentium;</hi> and, in the
                                    case of the Golden Rocket, in which the owner brought an action
                                    in an American court against an insurance company for the
                                    capture of his ship by the Florida, he being insured against
                                    piracy, but not against war risk, it was decided that captures
                                    by confederate cruisers were not “piracy” within the usual
                                    meaning of the word, and that the company was not liable.</p>
                                <p>The American courts having thus conclusively dealt with the
                                    matter, it is unnecessary <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340"

                                    meant is that, if the confederates had not possessed a <hi

                                    belligerents in the sense of waging public war, vessels under
                                    their commission would have been mere roving adventurers,
                                    pursuing merchantmen for the sake of private plunder; in short,
                                    pirates; but by the admission that “hostilities” (the very word
                                    to which exception is taken in the neutrality proclamation) were
                                    being prosecuted on a great scale, the only ground on which such
                                    a supposition could rest is cut away.</p>

                                    left England.</p>
                                <p>The Georgia or Japan was actually reported by the board of trade

                                    merchant-ship, and to be rather crank. Nothing was known of her
                                    proceedings until she had taken her arms and crew on board in
                                    Morlaix Bay and reached Cherbourg. Her real point of departure,

                                    being anything but a blockade-runner. She was fitted out as a

                                    confederate cruisers, and especially the Alabama.</p>
                                <p>There was no neglect to detain the Shenandoah or Georgia, for the
                                    reason that neither the government nor its officers knew they
                                    were being intended for the confederate service. Indeed, it has
                                    never been proved that the persons who sold those vessels knew
                                    it. Probably they did, but a case might very readily arise in
                                    which the vendors might be really ignorant. The American
                                    government could not have expected the English revenue officers
                                    to prevent every large steamer leaving England in ballast.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the Alabama, it is assumed “that the negligence of
                                    the officers of the British government was gross and
                                    inexcusable, and such as to indisputably to devolve on that
                                    government full responsibility for all the depredations
                                    committed by her. Indeed, this conclusion seems in effect to be
                                    conceded in Great Britain. At all events, the United States
                                    conceive that the proofs of responsible negligence in this
                                    matter are so clear that no room remains for debate on that
                                    point; and it <hi rend="italic">should be taken for granted in
                                        all future negotiations with Great Britain.”</hi></p>
                                <p>By a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi>, the whole argument
                                    is thus assumed to be in favor of the United States.</p>
                                <p>There is no doubt that the Alabama might, if she had not escaped
                                    at the moment when the case against her appeared to be legally
                                    established, have been seized and tried under the foreign
                                    enlistment act, though the result, looking to what occurred in
                                    the case of the Alexandra, might have been doubtful.</p>
                                <p>This, however, is a very different thing from admitting that her
                                    sale to the confederates was a violation of British neutrality
                                    for which the nation is responsible. This <pb n="341"
                                        xml:id="pg_341" facs="0399"/>was the first instance which
                                    occurred of the sale of a ship under such circumstances, and the
                                    British government had, in fact, no suspicion of what was going
                                    to be done in the matter, no information having been received of
                                    an intention to take out her arms and crew in a separate
                                    vessel.</p>
                                <p>Judge Story, in the well-known case “Santissima Trinidad and
                                    Santander,” laid it down as indisputable that” there is nothing
                                    in our laws, or in the law of nations, that forbids our citizens
                                    from sending armed vessels, as well as munitions of war, to
                                    foreign ports for sale. It is a commercial venture which no
                                    nation is bound to prohibit, and which only exposes the persons
                                    engaged in it to the penalty of confiscation.”</p>
                                <p>But it must be remembered that when Mr. Fish claims compensation
                                    for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> her depredations, he should not
                                    overlook the fact of the negligence shown by the Federal Navy in
                                    twice letting her escape from them. First, when Mr. Adams urged
                                    the captain of the Federal ship, which at his instance had gone
                                    to Holyhead to look after her, to pursue her, when the captain
                                    refused and went off to his station at Gibraltar instead—a
                                    proceeding at which Mr. Adams expressed the greatest
                                    indignation; (see Congress Papers, 1862, p. 159;) and secondly,
                                    when the United States ship “San Jacinto “blockaded her in the
                                    French port of St. Pierre, Martinque, and then suffered her to
                                    slip away at night from under her bows.</p>
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">III.—Supplies furnished to the
                                        confederates by British subjects.</hi></p>
                                <p>Mr. Fish states that the confederates had no ships, no mechanical
                                    appliances, no open sea-ports, &amp;c., and implies that the
                                    maritime force of the confederates was entirely derived from
                                    England.</p>
                                <p>The Sumter, Nashville, and Florida, however, all sailed from
                                    confederate ports in which they were armed and fitted out,
                                    besides a variety of small coasting privateers, such as the
                                    Tallahassee, whose captures form a considerable item in the list
                                    of Federal maritime losses lately presented to Congress.</p>
                                <p>"On the land it was in like manner the munitions of war and the
                                    wealth drawn by the insurgents from Great Britain which enabled
                                    them to withstand, year after year, the arms of the United
                                    States.”</p>
                                <p>If, as Mr. Fish states, the confederates had no open sea-ports,
                                    how did these munitions and arms reach them?</p>
                                <p>Either the blockade was inefficient, in which case it was
                                    illegal, and neutral nations were not bound to respect it, or it
                                    was efficient, as it was recognized by Great Britain to be, and
                                    the supply of arms, &amp;c., was hazardous and uncertain.</p>
                                <p>There is no doctrine more clearly settled than that neutral
                                    nations are not responsible for the supplies of contraband sent
                                    through a blockade by their subjects. Indeed, the very existence
                                    of a blockade implies this, for, if it were the duty of neutrals
                                    to prevent the shipment of supplies to belligerents, why should
                                    there be a blockade at all? Each side would claim compensation
                                    for the assistance rendered to the other, and neutrality would
                                    become impossible.</p>
                                <p>If once it be conceded that blockade-running is an offense
                                    against neutrality in a civil war, the precedent would not fail
                                    to be invoked in all wars by whichever belligerent considered
                                    himself most aggrieved. Instead of establishing a principle in
                                    the interests of future peace, this would lead to endless
                                    complications and claims and counter-claims, which would make
                                    the end of one war the sure beginning of another.</p>
                                <p>The question of the action of the Dutch in the war of
                                    independence cannot be dealt with without a review of the
                                    history of the period, for which this memorandum does not afford
                                    space. An account of the proceedings at Saint Eustache, and
                                    subsequent discussions with the Dutch government, will be found
                                    in De Marten’s “Nouvelles Causes Cé1èbres du Droit des
                                    Gens.”</p>
                                <p>As to the supplies sent through the blockade having been
                                    organized by confederate agents in England, the example was set
                                    them by the bureau established by Franklin at Paris for the
                                    assistance of the American provinces.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, it is notorious that the Federal troops were
                                    plentifully provided with arms and munitions from this
                                    country.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s government have yet to learn that it has been held
                                    in international discussions that individuals are precluded from
                                    supplying belligerents with munitions of war.</p>

                                <p>Mr. Fish proceeds to quote figures, showing the decrease in

                                <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0400"/>
                                <p>This allegation of national, indirect or constructive, claims was
                                    first brought forward officially by Mr. Reverdy Johnson in his
                                    attempt to renew negotiations on the claims convention in March
                                    last. (North America, No. 1, 1869, page 46.)</p>
                                <p>Mr. Thornton has shown the difficulty there would be in computing
                                    the amount of claim even if it were acknowledged, (North
                                    America, No. 1, 1869, page 53,) in a dispatch I in which he
                                    mentions the continual decrease of American tonnage.</p>
                                <p>This is partly, no doubt, to be ascribed to the disturbance of
                                    commercial relations, consequent on a long war, partly to the
                                    fact that many vessels were nominally transferred to British
                                    owners during the war to escape capture. Sir E. Hornby, in a
                                    recent report, states that this was a constant practice in
                                    China.</p>
                                <p>Is not, however, a good deal of it to be attributed to the high
                                    American tariff, which makes the construction of vessels in
                                    American ports more expensive than ship-building in England, and
                                    has thereby thrown so large a proportion of the carrying trade
                                    into English hands?</p>
                                <p>There must be some such cause for it, or otherwise American
                                    shipping would have recovered its position since the war,
                                    instead of continuing to fall off.</p>
                                <p>“Neither in the events which preceded that war,” (of 1812,) “nor
                                    in the events of the war itself, did the United States suffer
                                    more,” &amp;c.</p>
                                <p>No one can now wish to recall to recollection the particular
                                    events of that war; it would be much better for the two nations
                                    to congratulate themselves that one of the principal causes of
                                    it, the nationality dispute, has, it is to be hoped, been set at
                                    rest finally by Lord Stanley’s protocol.</p>
                                <p>V. The dispatch, in conclusion, refers “to important changes in
                                    the rules of public law,” the desirableness of which has been
                                    demonstrated, but does not say what are the changes to which it
                                    alludes.</p>
                                <p>This is in the spirit of the proposal made by Her Majesty’s
                                    government in December 1865, (North America, No. 1, 1866, page

                                <p>“I, however, asked Mr. Adams whether it would not be both useful
                                    and practical to let bygones be bygones, to forget the past, and
                                    turn the lessons of experience to account for the future.
                                    England and the United States, I said, had each become aware of

                                    which had been proved to be necessary. It was possible, I added,
                                    that the wounds inflicted by the war were still too recent, and
                                    that the ill-will toward England was still too rife, to render
                                    such an undertaking practicable at the present moment; but it
                                    was one which ought to be borne in mind, and that was earnestly
                                    desired by Her Majesty’s government, as a means of promoting
                                    peace and abating the horrors of war; and a work, therefore,
                                    which would be worthy of the civilization of our age, and which
                                    would entitle the governments which achieved it to the gratitude
                                    of mankind.”</p>
                                <p>It is not necessary in this memorandum to dwell on the alleged
                                    efficiency of the American as compared to the English foreign
                                    enlistment act. The failure of the American act in the
                                    Portuguese cases, in the repeated filibustering expeditions of
                                    Walker against Central America, and the acquittal under it of
                                    Lopez, the invader of Cuba, are proofs that its action cannot
                                    always be relied upon; and this is further corroborated by the
                                    difficulties now being experienced in dealing with the Hornet at
                                    Wilmington. Although, as Mr. Fish says, there have been
                                    prosecutions under it, it is believed that from the trial of
                                    Gideon Henfield in 1793 to the present day there has never been
                                    a criminal conviction. The only result of the proceedings <hi
                                        rend="italic">in rem</hi> has been to restore prizes, never
                                    to punish privateering; and the effect of the bonds which the
                                    act provides may be taken that the <hi rend="italic">owners</hi>
                                    of a vessel shall not <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> employ
                                    her in a belligerent service, and which has, it is believed,
                                    never been practically enforced, is, as Mr. Bemis, of Boston,
                                    points out in his volume on American neutrality, to add so much
                                    to the price of the vessel.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the claims for “vast national injuries,” it may be
                                    as well to observe that Professor Woolsey, the eminent American
                                    jurist, has repudiated them as untenable, while the strongest
                                    arguments in favor of the recognition of confederate
                                    belligerency are to be found in the notes to Mr. Dana’s eighth
                                    edition of Wheaton; and Mr. Lawrence, (the editor of the second
                                    annotated edition of Wheaton,) in a recent speech at Bristol,
                                    stated that “as far as respects the complaint founded on the
                                    recognition of the belligerent rights of the confederates, I
                                    cannot use too strong language in pronouncing its utter baseless
                                    character. No tyro in international law is ignorant that
                                    belligerency is a simple question of fact. With the late Sir
                                    Cornewall Lewis, we may ask, if the array of a million of men on
                                    each side does not constitute belligerency, what is
                                    belligerency? But what was the proclamation of the President,
                                    followed up by the condemnation of your ships and cargoes for a
                                    violation of the blockade which is established, but the
                                    recognition of a state of war? At this moment the United States,
                                    in claiming the property of the late confederate government,
                                    place before your tribunals their title on the fact of their
                                    being the successors of a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                                    government. I repeat that, however valid our claims may be
                                    against you on other grounds there is not the slightest <pb

                                    against you based on the public admission of a notorious fact,

                                    of the Federal Government.”</p>
                                <p>The course pursued by Great Britain in toe contest between
                                    Hungary and Austria in 1848–'49 may be cited as being in
                                    striking contrast with the course pursued toward the United
                                    States in 1861.</p>
                                <p>After the suppression of the insurrection at Vienna (October 29,
                                    1848) the Austrian generals determined to march against Hungary.
                                    At this time the combined Austrian armies consisted of about
                                    135,000 men. The Hungarians, on the other hand, with about
                                    125,000 men, occupied their entire territory, including their
                                    capital and all their fortresses. The fortress of Komorn,
                                    perhaps the strongest in Europe, appears to have been held by
                                    the Hungarians until the end of the revolution. On the 13th of
                                    December, 1848, the Austrians seemed to have gained no
                                    victories. The capture of Raab, the first of a number of
                                    successes which they obtained prior to their complete defeat in
                                    March, 1849, did not occur until December 20, 1848; meanwhile
                                    the Hungarians had been organizing for nearly a year for the
                                    purpose of making war against Austria.</p>
                                <p>[See Annual Register, vol. 90, p. 401; and vol. 91, p. 324.]</p>
                                <p>On the 11th of December, 1848, an envoy of the Hungarian
                                    executive government addressed a note to Viscount Palmerston,
                                    offering to furnish him with precise information of the actual
                                    state of the kingdom of Hungary, and asking an interview for
                                    that purpose.</p>
                                <p>On the 13th of December, 1848, the following reply was made to

                                <p>It will not be denied that whatever obligation there may be to

                                    resistance to its authority has not assumed the proportions and
                                    attained the probability of success to entitle it to be
                                    recognized by other nations as a belligerent.</p>
                                <p>In 1867 the British government appointed a commission to inquire
                                    into and consider the character, working, and effect of the
                                    British laws available for the enforcement of neutrality during
                                    the existence of hostilities between other states with whom
                                    Great Britain was at peace. In 1868 this commission made a
                                    report, containing, among other things in the appendix, a
                                    memorandum by Mr. Abbott (now Lord Tenterden) of the various
                                    foreign enlistment acts of Great Britain and other countries,
                                    including the United States. This memorandum is to be found in
                                    the fourth volume of Claims against Great Britain, page 93 <hi

                                <p>It resulted from this report that the comprehensive enlistment
                                    act, which may be found in the <ref target="frus1870#pg_158"
                                        >“Foreign Relations for 1870,” page 158</ref>, was
                                    passed.</p>
                                <p>It is not supposed that the liability of Great Britain to
                                    indemnify individual losses occasioned by the several cruisers
                                    will be seriously disputed, if it be first established that the
                                    cruisers were constructed, equipped, armed, or reinforced in her
                                    ports, in violation of her international obligations to the
                                    United States. But to make that point sure, the following
                                    correspondence (not contained in Mr. Abbott’s memorandum)
                                    between Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State, and Mr. Hammond,
                                    British minister at Washington, is introduced. This
                                    correspondence grew out of the illegal acts committed by French
                                    cruisers, alluded to in Mr. Abbott’s memorandum. It is to be
                                    observed that this correspondence took place before any statute
                                    or municipal law had been enacted by the United States, and the
                                    duty of the United States in that respect is placed upon its
                                    international obligations to Great Britain; and also that the
                                    action of the United States was taken without any information
                                    furnished by any agent or representative of the British
                                    government.</p>

                                        equipment to a vessel in our ports shall invalidate her
                                        prizes through all time, would be a measure of incalculable
                                        consequences. And since our interference must be governed by
                                        some general rule, and between great and small equipments no
                                        practicable line of distinction can be drawn, it will be
                                        attended with less evil on the whole to rely on the
                                        efficiency of the means of prevention, that they will reach
                                        with certainty equipments of any magnitude, and the great
                                        mass of those of smaller importance also; and if some should
                                        in the event escape all our vigilance, to consider these as
                                        of the number of cases which will at times baffle the
                                        restraints of the wisest and best-guarded rules which human
                                        foresight can devise. And I think we may safely rely that
                                        since the regulations which got into a course of execution
                                        about the middle of August last, it is scarcely possible
                                        that equipments of any importance should escape
                                        discovery.</p>
                                    <p>These principles showing that no demand of restitution lies
                                        on the ground of a mere military alteration, or an
                                        argumentation of force, I will consider your letter only as
                                        a complaint that the orders of the President prohibiting
                                        these have not had their effect in the case of the Industry,
                                        and inquire whether, if this be so, it has happened either
                                        from neglect or connivance in those charged with the
                                        execution of these orders. For this we must resort to facts,
                                        which shall be taken from the evidence furnished by yourself
                                        and the British vice-consul at Baltimore, and from that
                                        which shall accompany this letter.</p>
                                    <p>About the beginning of August the Industry is said to have
                                        arrived at Baltimore with the French fleet from San Domingo.
                                        The particular state of her armament on her arrival is
                                        lately questioned, but it is not questioned that she was an
                                        armed vessel of some degree. The Executive having received
                                        an intimation that two vessels were equipping themselves at
                                        Baltimore for a cruise, a letter was, on the 6th of August,
                                        addressed by the Secretary of War to the governor of
                                        Maryland, desiring an inquiry into the fact. In his absence,
                                        the executive council of Maryland charged one of their own
                                        body, the Hon. Mr. Kilty, with the inquiry. He proceeded to
                                        Baltimore, and, after two days’ examination, found no vessel
                                        answering the description of those which were the object of
                                        his inquiry. He then engaged the British vice-consul in the
                                        search, who was not able, any more than himself, to discover
                                        any such vessels. Captain Kilty, however, observing a
                                        schooner, which appeared to have been making some equipments
                                        for a cruise, to have added to her guns, and made some
                                        alteration to her waist, thought these circumstances merited
                                        examination, though the rules of August had not yet
                                        appeared. Finding that his inquiries excited suspicion, and
                                        fearing the vessel might be withdrawn, he had her seized,
                                        and proceeded in the investigation. He found that she was
                                        the schooner Industry, Captain Carvin, from San Domingo;
                                        that she had been an armed vessel for three years before her
                                        coming here, and as late as April last had mounted sixteen
                                        guns; that she now mounted only twelve, and he could not
                                        learn that she had procured any of these or done anything
                                        else, essential to her as a privateer, at Baltimore. He
                                        therefore discharged her, and on the 23d of August the
                                        executive Council made the report to the Secretary of War,
                                        of which I inclose you a copy.</p>
                                    <p>About a fortnight after this (September 6) you added to a
                                        letter on other business a short paragraph, saying that you
                                        had lately received information that a vessel named the
                                        Industry had, within the last five or six weeks, been armed,
                                        manned, and equipped in the port of Baltimore. The
                                        proceedings before mentioned, having been in another
                                        Department, were not then known to me. I therefore could
                                        only communicate this paragraph to the proper Department.
                                        The separation of the Executive within a week after
                                        prevented any explanations on the subject, and without them
                                        it was not in my power either to controvert or admit the
                                        information you had received. Under these circumstances I
                                        think you must be sensible, sir, that your conclusions from
                                        my silence, that I regarded the fact as proved, was not a
                                        very necessary one.</p>
                                    <p>New inquiries at that time could not have prevented the
                                        departure of the privateer or the capture of the Roehampton,
                                        for the privateer had then been out for some time, the
                                        Roehampton was already taken, and was arriving at Baltimore;
                                        which she did <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0415"/>about
                                        the day of the date of your letter. After her arrival new
                                        witnesses have come forward to prove that the Industry had
                                        made some military equipments at Baltimore before her
                                        cruise. The affidavits taken by the British vice-consul are
                                        dated about nine or ten days after the date of your letter
                                        and arrival of the Roehampton; and we have only to lament
                                        that those witnesses had not given their information to the
                                        vice-consul when Mr. Kilty engaged his aid in the inquiries
                                        he was making, and when it would have had the effect of our
                                        detaining the privateer till she should have reduced herself
                                        to the condition in which she was when she arrived in our
                                        ports, if she had really added anything to her then force.
                                        But supposing the testimony just and full, (though taken <hi
                                            rend="italic">ex parte</hi>, and not under the legal
                                        sanction of an oath,) yet the governor’s refusal to restore
                                        the prize was perfectly proper, for, as has been before
                                        observed, restitution has never been made by the Executive,
                                        nor can be made, on a mere clandestine alteration or
                                        augmentation of military equipment, which was all that the
                                        new testimony tended to prove.</p>
                                    <p>Notwithstanding, however, that the President thought the
                                        information obtained on the former occasion had cleared this
                                        privateer from any well-grounded cause of arrest, yet that
                                        which you have now offered opens a possibility that the
                                        former was defective. He has, therefore, desired new inquiry
                                        to be made before a magistrate legally authorized to
                                        administer an oath and indifferent to both parties; and
                                        should the result be that the vessel did really make any
                                        military equipments in our ports, instructions will be given
                                        to reduce her to her original condition whenever she shall
                                        again come into our ports.</p>
                                    <p>On the whole, sir, I hope you will perceive that, on the
                                        first intimation, through their own channels, and without
                                        waiting for information on your part, that a vessel was
                                        making military equipments at Baltimore, the Executive took
                                        the best measures for inquiring into the fact, in order to
                                        prevent or suppress such equipments; that an officer of high
                                        respectability was charged with the inquiry; that he made it
                                        with great diligence himself, and engaged similar inquiries
                                        on the part of your vice-consul; that neither of them could
                                        find that this privateer had made such equipments, or, of
                                        course, that there was any ground for reducing or detaining
                                        her; that at the date of your letter of September 6 (the
                                        first intimation received from you) the privateer was
                                        departed, had taken her prize, and that prize was arriving
                                        in port; that the new evidence, taken ten days after that
                                        arrival, can produce no other effect than the institution of
                                        a new inquiry, and a reduction of the force of the
                                        privateer, should she appear to have made any military
                                        alterations or augmentation, on her return into our ports;
                                        and that in no part of this procedure is there the smallest
                                        ground for imputing either negligence or connivance to any
                                        of the officers who have acted in it.</p>
                                    <p>I have the honor to be, sir, with much respect, yours,

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your communications of the 6th instant
                                arrived in the absence of Governor Lee, who is gone to the Virginia
                                Springs. They were, of course, taken into consideration by the
                                council, whose assistance the governor, for reasons stated to you in
                                his letter of the 6th June last, has constantly required in matters
                                of this kind. We immediately adopted the expedient of deputing a
                                member to Baltimore, furnished with all the authority we could
                                confer, to carry the views of the President into effect. Captain
                                Kilty, who accepted this mission, has returned, and reports as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>That on his arrival in Baltimore he began and for two days pursued a
                                diligent inquiry respecting, the two vessels said to be fitting out
                                as privateers, without receiving any satisfactory account. That he
                                then determined to interest the British vice-consul (Mr. Edward
                                    Thornton<note n="*" xml:id="d9fn1">Mr. Thornton was the father
                                    of the present distinguished representative of H. B. M. at
                                    Washington.</note>) in the search; accordingly he opened his
                                busines to that gentleman, who he believes used every endeavor to
                                discover the privateers in question, but without effect. That he
                                (Captain Kilty) then took an actual observation, in the public
                                barge, of all the vessels in the harbor, and remained at length
                                convinced that either those described by the Secretary of War were
                                not there, or that they were not in such a state of preparation for
                                cruising as to make it possible to discover their intention. That he
                                had, however, observed at a wharf on Fell’s Point a schooner
                                mounting twelve guns. Although this vessel, as well from her size as
                                her having come in with the fleet from San Domingo, could not be the
                                Virginia pilot-boat mentioned in the Secretary of War’s letter, yet
                                as she seemed to have been making some equipments, and was evidently
                                intended for a cruise, Captain Kilty thought it proper to make some
                                    <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0416"/>inquiries respecting
                                her. He did so, as far as was consistent with his resolution not to
                                alarm those concerned in her, until he should have put himself in a
                                condition to seize her, if he should find it necessary. The cautious
                                manner in which this consideration obliged him to proceed rendered
                                his intelligence very incomplete. On the whole, however, it appeared
                                that she had added to her number of guns and made some alteration to
                                her waist since her arrival with the fleet, but where the additional
                                cannon were procured he could not learn. Although the regulations on
                                this subject had not then appeared, it occurred to him that military
                                equipments (although partial ones) were not permitted in our ports,
                                and while he was considering whether the circumstances he had
                                discovered would justify him in detaining the vessel, ad had
                                returned to Fell’s Point to make a final observation and inquiry, he
                                learned that an intimation of his design was on its way to her
                                commander. Apprehending, therefore, that she would draw off into the
                                stream, and make a visit to her difficult, if not impracticable, he
                                resolved to get possession while it was in his power, and
                                accordingly desired Mr. Gray-bill, the deputy marshal, to meet him
                                at an appointed hour with a few gentlemen who could be confided in.
                                This being done Captain Kilty went on board and inquired for the
                                captain and other officers, but none of them were there. He then
                                gave the vessel in charge to Mr. Graybill, desiring him to do
                                whatever was necessary to disable her from moving off. He then
                                inquired without reserve respecting the equipments she had made in
                                Baltimore, but could not learn that she had procured guns or done
                                anything that was essential to her as a privateer. That having left
                                the vessel, he was about to return to the town for the purpose of
                                finding the captain, who was said to be there, but was surprised
                                with the appearance of a considerable body of Frenchmen, with a
                                leader and a drum at their head, marching hastily toward the
                                schooner; that being persuaded they intended to retake her, he
                                opposed their progress, and some circumstances of tumult ensued,
                                which at length subsided by these people protesting their ignorance
                                of her having been taken by authority.</p>
                            <p>That the next morning Captain Kilty received a visit from the
                                captain, Jean Baptiste Carvin, who is likewise owner of the
                                schooner, and who with great temper asked the reasons of his vessel
                                having been seized. That, on being informed that the principal
                                ground of the measure was his having enlarged his number of guns, he
                                produced papers signed by the proper officers at San Domingo, by
                                which it appeared that his vessel, called the “Industry/’ has
                                carried guns these three years past, and that on the 11th of April
                                last she mounted sixteen, and had a crew sufficient for
                                privateering. He produced likewise a commission or license for
                                cruising, by which, as he explained it, the prizes went to the
                                government, and the captors received a reasonable gratification.
                                After exhibiting these papers, he asserted that he had procured no
                                guns, or anything of a military nature, except a few spare rammers
                                in Baltimore, but that the guns he appeared to have mounted since
                                his arrival were brought in his hold. He acknowledged the purchase
                                of some cordage and the cleaning the bottom of the vessel, with
                                other things of an indifferent nature, and concluded with demanding
                                if the armed vessels in general in the harbor were not equally
                                liable to detention with his.</p>
                            <p>That, without thinking himself obliged to give entire credit to all
                                these declarations, Captain Kilty still found it impossible to
                                disprove any of them, and, therefore, being satisfied that no
                                representation he should be able to make would induce or authorize
                                the Federal Executive to continue the restriction he had laid on the
                                vessel, but that, on the contrary, heavy damages would be incurred
                                by the public for her detention, he resolved, after he should
                                previously inquire of the French vice-consul respecting the
                                authenticity of the documents exhibited by the captain, to release
                                the vessel. Accordingly, he waited on that officer, who, with great
                                readiness, said much more than was required, and, this ceremony
                                being finished, Captain Kilty directed Mr. Graybill to release the
                                vessel.</p>

                                    (excepting that of France) trading with the United States, if
                                    the <hi rend="italic">largest</hi> circumstance of military

                                    by this Government as sufficient to invalidate prizes brought
                                    into its ports by vessels under this predicament. In the present
                                    case the facts are that the schooner Industry, according to the,
                                    deposition of Benjamin Baker, of Baltimore, (at whose wharf and
                                    ship-yard she lay during her additional equipment,) had no more
                                    than <hi rend="italic">four or six</hi> cannon mounted when she
                                    was brought to his wharf; that, when she left it, “she had <hi
                                        rend="italic">four six-pounders, eight four-pounders, and

                                    she had added to the number of her guns, and had made
                                    alterations of a warlike nature; but as he could not learn
                                    whence these additional cannon had been procured, he did not
                                    deem himself justifiable in refusing his assent to the
                                    authenticity of the documents produced by the captain of the

                                        1829, four vessels left Plymouth ostensibly for Brazil, with
                                        six hundred and fifty-two officers and men. The British

                                        expedition appeared, to give them warning against hovering
                                        about or making any effort to effect a landing; and, in case
                                        of their persistence against the warning, to drive them away
                                        from that neighborhood, and to keep sight of them until
                                        convinced that they had no intention of returning to the
                                        Western Islands or proceeding to Maderia. It became
                                        necessary in carrying out these orders to fire upon the
                                        expedition. One man was killed, some were wounded, and the
                                        expedition was broken up. This act gave rise to an extended
                                        debate in Parliament, and the conduct of the government was

                                Austrian corps, acting as auxiliaries of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

                                not far off, and returning afterward to take away other cargoes.
                                This was done at the houses of Mr. Hall, of a widow lady, and of
                                other persons; each of those houses having, as a matter of

                            <p>We have been informed with reference to the demand for
                                indemnification which England makes against Tuscany for the alleged
                                damages which English subjects had suffered in Leghorn, in
                                consequence of the suppression of the revolt which took place in
                                that city in May of 1849. Such a claim, from all points of view, is
                                worthy the attention of the imperial government. In fact, the
                                injuries which gave room for this claim are attributed to the troops
                                of His Majesty the Emperor, which acted as the allies of the
                                legitimate sovereign of Tuscany. On the other hand, independently of
                                this circumstance, it was natural that Austria, united to Tuscany by
                                so many close ties, and by ancient and modern treaties, should lend,
                                and lends, a particular interest to whatever refers to that country.
                                Finally, and it is the point of most importance, the English
                                pretensions tend to raise a question of principle, the solution of
                                which is of the highest importance for the independence and security
                                of all the states which maintain friendly relations with
                                Germany.</p>
                            <p>The origin of the claim goes back to the period in which the city of
                                Leghorn was in full insurrection against the legitimate government.
                                The Austrian troops called to re-establish the authority of the laws
                                were received at the cannon’s mouth; and firing upon them continued
                                from the windows until the city was captured.</p>
                            <p>Our soldiers found themselves obliged to enter by force into
                                warehouses and dwellings in order to ascertain if armed men and
                                munitions of war were uot therein concealed. If, on such an
                                occasion, and in spite of the efforts of our officers to prevent
                                -disorder, there was such disorder; and if some articles belonging
                                to Englishmen were abstracted or destroyed by our soldiers,
                                irritated by the fight and by a blind and tenacious resistance, is
                                there cause for surprise? Ought not that misfortune to be counted
                                among the fatal and inevitable consequences of war?</p>
                            <p>It is under this point of view, sustained besides by the principles
                                of right generally recognized, that the government of the Grand Duke
                                has declared that he is not obliged to concede indemnification to
                                those of his subjects who have suffered losses in consequence of the
                                storming of the city of Leghorn, when it was obliged to surrender,
                                after having refused all conciliatory propositions.</p>
                            <p>In consequence, the government of the Grand Duke of Tuscany has
                                objected to treat the English mare favorably than his own subjects.
                                He has not thought it to be a duty to place the English subjects in
                                a more advantageous position, by paying them in character of
                                indemnity sums which are not paid to Tuscan subjects; the more so,
                                inasmuch as if the foreigners had placed their persons and property
                                in security, they would have been able to escape with ease the
                                general misfortunes to which the inhabitants of a besieged city must
                                submit themselves.</p>
                            <p>These reasons, which the Tuscan government has opposed to the demands
                                of Lord Palmerston, appear to us founded upon principles so high and
                                so unquestionable, that with regret we have seen his excellency
                                persist in such pretensions, notwithstanding the weight of those
                                reasons.</p>
                            <p>So far from desisting, the English embassador receives orders to
                                persist energetically, and to cause to be understood that if the
                                claims were not admitted by the Tuscan government, England would be
                                under the necessity of enforcing them by adopting energetic
                                means.</p>
                            <p>By advice of the English embassador in Florence, Tuscany proposed to
                                submit the matter to the arbitrament of a third power. Even though a
                                mode of procedure had been adopted in this question which would
                                have’ permitted a pacific solution, we cannot conceal that, in the
                                presence of other analogous acts more recent and generally known,
                                the categorical language of the English cabinet <hi rend="italic"

                                are resolved to maintain firm and unchangeable, and to claim for
                                Englishmen established in a foreign country an exceptional position,
                                would be to force, so to say, the other states to place themselves
                                on guard against the consequences of a pretension so contrary to
                                their independence, because they would impose, even by force, other
                                conditions upon the English subjects whom they consent to
                                receive.</p>
                            <p>We would certainly be the first to adopt that necessary measure,
                                which, it is necessary to confess, would form a notable contrast to
                                the tendency of our epoch to multiply and activate the commercial
                                relations between peoples, and to lessen the distance which
                                separates them.</p>
                            <p>Let this be as it may, the first right of an independent state is to
                                insure its self-preservation by all the means in its power. From the
                                time that a sovereign, availing himself of his right, finds himself
                                obliged to have recourse to arms to suppress <hi rend="italic">an
                                    insurrection, and that in the civil war which results the
                                    property of foreigners established in the country is in
                                    jeopardy, in my view it is a public misfortune, which foreigners
                                    should suffer as well as natives, and which does not entitle
                                    them to exceptional indemnity</hi>, as they neither would have
                                that right if any other calamity should happen proceeding from the
                                will of men.</p>
                            <p>Such is, in its most simple expression, the questionable point
                                suggested to the Tuscan government. We are impressed with the
                                gravity of the consequences which proceed from the question of
                                knowing if the principle treated of ought or ought not to be
                                respected; and for this reason we obey the necessity of submitting
                                it in the most frank manner to the examination of the British
                                government. It belongs to it to weigh the question in its great
                                wisdom and equity, and this will lead, as we hope, to a quick and
                                satisfactory solution of the question which is being discussed.</p>

                                <p>The cabinet of Saint Petersburgh adheres completely to the
                                    principles which have served as the basis to the demand of the
                                    cabinet of Vienna. Russia is too much interested in the
                                    maintenance of the independence of the secondary states and in
                                    the repose of Italy, and for this reason cannot but associate
                                    itself in this case with the sentiments and political views of
                                    Austria.</p>
                                <p>According to the rules of public right, such as they are
                                    understood by Russian policy, it cannot be admitted that a
                                    sovereign, obliged, as was the Grand Duke of Tuscany, <hi

                                        to indemnify foreign subjects who may have suffered damages
                                        in consequence of the assault undertaken against that
                                        city.</hi></p>

                                        dangers to which he may be exposed in that country</hi>.
                                    Leghorn revolted; it was necessary to employ arms to reduce it.
                                    Some English proprietors have participated in the damages
                                    experienced by the native proprietors. Why should they alone
                                    have the right to be indemnified for their losses, when the
                                    Tuscan government does not indemnify its own subjects?</p>
                                <p>These reasons are so clear, that Tuscany, having applied to the
                                    Emperor, asking his arbitrament, the Emperor, notwithstanding
                                    the lively interest which he has for Tuscany, has not been able
                                    to accede to its desire. It is not a question of figures, more
                                    or less in amount, which is treated of, but of a principle,
                                    which his imperial Majesty cannot admit—that is to say, the
                                    principle of any indemnification whatever claimed as a
                                    legitimate right, much less when it is sought to exact it by
                                    force. It would have appeared that he implicitly sanctioned it
                                    had he offered his arbitration to the two parties, supposing
                                    England had consented to adopt the expedient.</p>
                                <p>As Tuscany is disposed to tender conciliatory explanations, it
                                    could not enter into the intentions of the Russian government to
                                    dissuade it from a friendly arrangement with the English
                                    government. But the Emperor hopes, from the justice and
                                    moderation of the English government itself, that it will not,
                                    to obtain it, employ other than conciliatory means also; and the
                                    imperial cabinet ought, in so much as it is concerned, at once
                                    to make its reservations as to all that which it considers as in
                                    small conformity with the recognized maxims of the law of
                                    nations.</p>
                                <p>The cabinet of London ought to <hi rend="italic">recognize that
                                        one of the gravest questions for the independence of all the
                                        states of the continent is being treated of</hi>. In effect,
                                    if what England attempts to establish at this moment with
                                    respect to Naples and Tuscany should come to be admitted as a
                                    precedent, it would result in placing British subjects abroad in

                                    people, their presence would be a perpetual inconvenience, and,
                                    in certain cases, a real affliction. Their presence would be,
                                    for the promoters of insurrections, a stimulant to revolt,
                                    because, if behind the barricades there should be continually
                                    raised the threatening eventuality of future reclamations in

                                    positions and respective weakness expose to the coercive
                                    measures of an English fleet, would become powerless in the
                                    presence of an insurrection; they could not dare to use coercive
                                    means, and if they used them, would have to examine the details
                                    of the operation, estimate the necessity or uselessness of this
                                    or that strategic measure, which might expose the English to
                                    suffer losses; they would have, finally, to recognize the
                                    English government as judge between sovereign and subject in
                                    matters of civil war and of interior government.</p>
                                <p>The Emperor cannot, then, subscribe to such a theory. He will
                                    never compromise in the matter of the principles which he has
                                    just set forth. For, very much disposed as he may be, and as he
                                    always has been, to receive with benevolence individuals
                                    belonging to the British nation, his esteem for whose character

                                    the conditions upon which he will henceforth consent to allow to
                                    British subjects the right of residence and of property in his

                            <p>On the 12th February, 1864, in reply to strictures on some decisions
                                in prize-cases, the attorney-general, Sir Roundell Palmer, said, in
                                the House of Commons: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Though in the judgments of the United States prize-court
                                        there may be passages open to criticism upon I matters of
                                        legal theory, and although I am far from saying that they
                                        have always applied the principles of law correctly to the
                                        facts of the case, yet I am not aware of one single decision
                                        pronounced during the war in any one of those courts which
                                        does not bear upon the face of it signs of an honest
                                        intention to administer the law as received in the United
                                        States; and the case of the Springbok is no exception to
                                        that rule. In all the three points to which my honorable

                                        rightly applied to the facts and evidence, the decision come
                                        to was based on principles, be they right or be they wrong,
                                        which were principles of bur own prize-courts in the war

                                    <p>I think it right, however, to state, with regard to the
                                        Government of the United States, what has indeed been
                                        already stated by my honorable and learned friend, the
                                        attorney-general, that we have no reason to mistrust the
                                        equity and independence of the tribunals of the United
                                        States which have to try questions such as those now under
                                        discussion; and it is but due to the Government of the
                                        United States to say that they have invariably received our
                                        representations in a spirit of respect, equity, and justice.
                                        And in proof of this, to show that, when we had a strong
                                        case of remonstrance, justice has been done to us by the
                                        United States, I need only refer to the case of the Trent,
                                        in which the Government of the United States very handsomely
                                        and properly did justice to the demands we made, and the
                                        rights they did not deny. Therefore, I think it is
                                        prejudicial to the good understanding between the two
                                        governments, which are on good terms, that we should here
                                        accuse a foreign government of that of which it is not
                                        guilty, and express mistrust of their equity and fairness
                                        when nothing has occurred to justify us in making these
                                        imputations. I think it only right, in regard to the
                                        tribunals and Government of the United States, to declare
                                        that such accusations are not just, and that nothing has
                                        occurred to warrant them.</p>

                            <p>Since these instructions were given a British blue-book, relating to
                                the “Claims of British subjects against the United States
                                Government, from the commencement of the civil war to the 30th of
                                March, 1864,” which had been reprinted in the diplomatic
                                correspondence, submitted to Congress in the year 1864, (Diplomatic
                                correspondence, 1864, part I, page 736,) has been reprinted in one
                                of the leading journals of the country, with a view undoubtedly of
                                enabling the public to see that most of the claims described in it
                                have been disposed of.</p>
                            <p>An analysis of that document shows the following results:</p>
                            <p>Three hundred and twenty-one cases of the four hundred and fifty
                                therein enumerated have been disposed of.</p>
                            <p>Of these forty-three were cases in which the British government
                                refused to interfere, on the advice of the law officers of the
                                Crown.</p>
                            <p>One hundred and sixty-seven cases have been condemned by the
                                prize-courts of the United States. With the exception of one case,
                                that of the Springbok, the Department of State is not aware of a
                                disposition on the part of the British government to dissent to any
                                final adjudication of the Supreme Court of the United States in a
                                prize-case. The Supreme Court has in several cases reversed
                                condemnations made by the inferior tribunals of prizes, in some of
                                which Congress has made appropriations for the indemnification, of
                                the owners of the property captured.</p>
                            <p>In most of the cases where it is stated that vessels have been
                                condemned, but that appeals are pending, the condemnations by the
                                courts below have been sustained.</p>
                            <p>In sixty-three cases it appears that property taken by the United
                                States has been restored, and that persons imprisoned, or said to
                                have been illegally enlisted, have been released.</p>
                            <p>While the conferences were being held in Washington, a correspondence
                                was going on in England between the foreign office and British
                                subjects residing in France, and preferring claims for the loss of
                                property since the entry of the German army into France. A portion
                                of this correspondence has been published in Blue-Book No. 4, for
                                1871, Franco-German War. The following letters from this publication
                                bear directly upon the questions considered in this portion of the

                                ruinous conditon. The German troops passed one night on the premises
                                after the temporary occupation of Paris, but did no additional
                                damage to the property. My other houses within the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >enceinte</hi> of Paris were occupied wholly by French troops
                                and French peasants. “No destruction of property by invading armies”
                                consequently took place in my case.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion, my claim is similar to that made by your lordship on
                                the German Government for the loss sustained by British ship-owners
                                whose vessels were seized and sunk near Rouen. In the one case ships
                                were seized and destroyed by the German authorities; and, in the
                                other, houses were seized and destroyed by the French authorities,
                                both belonging to British subjects, and demanding similar
                                compensation.</p>
                            <p>I have now, therefore, to beg that your lordship will be so good as
                                to forward my claim on the French government to Lord Lyons, with a
                                request that his excellency will give me such assistance as may be
                                required in his capacity of English ambassador, in order to induce
                                the French government to entertain my claim when the proper time
                                shall arrive for submitting it to the authorities. I beg, however,
                                to add that I am informed that, by the law of France, compensation
                                is due not only to foreigners, but to French subjects for injury
                                done to their property by invading armies, and for the occupation of
                                their houses by French troops, and for damages resulting therefrom.
                                I trust, therefore, that it will not be necessary to call for Lord
                                Lyons’s intervention.</p>
                            <p>I have thought it my duty to trouble your lordship with this letter,
                                    <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0428"/>in order that I may

                                found that few British subjects are in the same position as I am

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am directed by Earl Granville to
                                acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which,
                                with reference to the answer which Lord Granville caused to be
                                returned to your letter of the 22d of March, respecting the losses
                                which you state you have sustained by the occupation of your houses
                                in Paris and the neighborhood by French troops during the war, you
                                now submit that your case does not come within the terms of that
                                which had been submitted to the law-officers of the Crown, and upon
                                whose opinion with reference thereto the answer to your
                                representation had been founded, inasmuch as there was “no
                                destruction of property by invading armies,” but that the damage was
                                caused in consequence of the occupation of your property by French
                                troops, which property had been vacated by orders of the French
                                authorities themselves.</p>
                            <p>I am now to state to you that Lord Granville has taken the opinion of
                                the law-officers upon your further application, and I am to observe
                                that Her Majesty’s subjects resident in France cannot of right claim
                                to be in a better position in respect to their immovable property in
                                France than French subjects, and that, if you have been correctly
                                informed as to the law of France, the intervention of Her Majesty’s
                                government will not be required to enable you to prefer a claim
                                before the French authorities to compensation for any losses
                                resulting to you from the occupation of your houses by French
                                troops. But whether you have been correctly informed or not, Her
                                Majesty’s government cannot intervene, if you receive at the bands
                                of the French government the same treatment which French subjects
                                themselves receive.</p>
                            <p>With regard to your allusion to the case of the British ships which
                                have sunk at Rouen, I am to observe that there is no analogy between
                                ships and immovable property.</p>

                                    government against a claimant. Mr. Worth, a British subject,
                                    claimed indemnity on account of imprisonment to which he was
                                    subjected by the German authorities on his capture, in an
                                    attempt to escape from Paris in a balloon.</p>
                                <p>Lord Enfield, in a note of the 3d of April, informs Mr. Worth
                                    that Lord Granville regrets that, “<hi rend="italic">after

                                1854, by the United States Government, the discussions respecting
                                the rights of American fishermen under Article I of the convention
                                of the 20th of October, 1818, which had been set at rest by the
                                reciprocity treaty, were revived, and, although temporary measures
                                were taken to avoid pressing with severity upon American fishermen
                                by the adoption of a <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0432"/>system
                                of licenses, it has been found impracticable to continue that system
                                indefinitely, and, on its withdrawal, much excitement has been
                                occasioned among the coast population of the Eastern States of the
                                Union by the capture of boats engaged in illegal fishing, contrary
                                to the convention of 1818.</p>
                            <p>The correspondence will put you in possession of the facts of the
                                several captures, and enable you to judge, and explain, if
                                necessary, how far the pretensions of the American fishermen are
                                exaggerated, and the leniency with which they have been treated
                                under the directions of Her Majesty’s government and of the

                            <p>Irrespective, however, of the captures and confiscations of boats
                                during the recent fishing season, there are, and have been for many
                                years, differences of interpretation put upon the convention of 1818
                                by the respective governments, which might, at any time, rise into
                                serious importance.</p>
                            <p>The two chief questions are: As to whether the expression “three
                                marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of His
                                Britannic Majesty’s dominions “should be taken to mean a limit of
                                three miles from the coast line, or a limit of three miles from a
                                line drawn from headland to headland and whether the proviso that
                                “the American fishermen shall be admitted to enter such bays or
                                harbors for the purpose of shelter, and of repairing damages
                                therein, of purchasing wood, and of obtaining water, and for no
                                other purpose whatever, is intended to exclude American vessels from
                                coming inshore to traffic, transship fish, purchase stores, hire
                                seamen, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government would be glad to learn that you were able to
                                arrive at a conclusive understanding with the commissioners of the
                                United States upon the disputed interpretation of the convention of
                                1818; but they fear that you will find it expedient that a
                                settlement should be arrived at by some other means, in which case
                                they will be prepared for the whole question of the relations
                                between the United States and the British possessions in North
                                America, as regards the fisheries, being referred for consideration
                                and inquiry to an international commission, on which two
                                commissioners, to be hereafter appointed, in consultation with the
                                government of the Dominion, should be the British
                                representatives.</p>
                            <p>Should the Government of the United States concur in this, it would
                                be advisable that no time should be lost in appointing commissioners
                                on their side, and in the commission commencing its labors; and, as
                                it is scarcely probable that the commissioners will be able to
                                report, and a treaty be framed, before the commencement of the next
                                fishing season, it would be also desirable that you should agree
                                upon some means, by license or otherwise, by which disputes may be
                                avoided in the meanwhile.</p>

                                acknowledged as existing by this article of the reciprocity treaty,
                                under which the British government retained the right of suspending

                            <p>Her Majesty’s Government are, nevertheless, now willing to admit the

                                as may be imposed equally on British subjects.</p>
                            <p>This, however, cannot extend, except as a special privilege to the

                                through British territory, without which, from the strength of the

                            <p>It would be desirable to take this opportunity to consider whether it
                                might not be the interest of both Great Britain and the United
                                States to lay down certain rules of international comity in regard
                                to the obligations of maritime neutrality, not only to be
                                acknowledged for observance in their future relations, but to be
                                recommended for adoption to the other maritime powers.</p>
                            <p>I have thus touched briefly upon the subjects likely, principally, to
                                engage your attention, and have indicated the manner in which they
                                may be possibly treated; but Her Majesty’s government wish you to
                                understand that you are not thereby precluded from entertaining the
                                consideration of other questions or making any suggestions you may
                                think proper for their settlement.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government request, however, that if the mode of
                                dealing with any particular matter which you may be disposed to
                                agree to should vary materially from the manner of settlement to
                                which I have informed you Her Majesty’s government are prepared at
                                once to assent, or, in case of any disagreement of importance
                                occurring between yourselves and the American High Commissioners,
                                you should at once report by telegraph, and await further

                                dispatched contrary to the neutrality of neutral state should be
                                admitted into any port of that state.</p>
                            <p>That prizes captured by such vessels, or otherwise captured in

                            <p>That, in time of war, no vessel should be recognized as a ship of

                        <p>The United States Commissioner stated that, although appreciating the
                            proposal, they did not consider it necessary that a president should be
                            named.</p>
                        <p>The High Commissioners, on the suggestion of Mr. Fish, requested Lord
                            Tenterden, Secretary to the British High Commission, and Mr. Bancroft
                            Davis, Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, acting as
                            secretary to the United States High Commission, to undertake the duties
                            of joint protocolists.</p>
                        <p>The High Commissioners then agreed that the subjects for discussion
                            should be those mentioned in the following correspondence which had
                            taken place between the two Governments.</p>

                                that Her Majesty’s Government deem it of importance to the good
                                relations which they are ever anxious should subsist and be
                                strengthened between the United States and Great Britain, that a
                                friendly and complete understanding should be come to between the
                                two Governments as to the extent of the rights which belong to the
                                citizens of the United States and Her Majesty’s subjects,
                                respectively, with reference to the fisheries on the coasts of Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America, and as to any other
                                questions between them which affect the relations of the United
                                States toward those possessions.</p>
                            <p>As the consideration of these matters would, however, involve
                                investigations of a somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very
                                desirable that they should be thoroughly examined, I am directed by
                                Lord Granville to propose to the Government of the United States the
                                appointment of a Joint High Commission, which shall be composed of
                                members to be named by each Government; shall hold its sessions at
                                Washington, and shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the
                                different questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well
                                as all those which affect the relations of the United States toward
                                Her Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I am confident that this proposal will be met by your Government in
                                the same cordial spirit of friendship which has induced Her
                                Majesty’s Government to tender it and I cannot doubt that in that
                                case the result will not fail to contribute to the maintenance of
                                the good relations between the two countries, which I am convinced
                                the Government of the United States, as well as that of Her Majesty,
                                equally have at heart.</p>

                                compliance with instructions from Earl Granville, that Her Majesty’s
                                Government deem it of importance to the good relations which they
                                are ever anxious should subsist and be strengthened between the

                                America, and as to any other questions between them which affect the
                                relations of the United States toward those possesions; and further,
                                that as the consideration of these questions would involve

                                desirable that they should be thoroughly examined, you are directed
                                by <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0442"/>Lord Granville to
                                propose to the Government of the United States the appointment of a
                                Joint High Commission, which shall be composed of members to be
                                named by each Government; shall hold its sessions at Washington, and
                                shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the different
                                questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well as all
                                those which affect the relations of the United States toward Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I have laid your note before the President, who instructs me to say
                                that he shares with Her Majesty’s Government the appreciation of the
                                importance of a friendly and complete understanding between the two
                                Governments with reference to the subjects specially suggested for
                                the consideration of the proposed Joint High Commission, and he
                                fully recognizes the friendly spirit which has prompted the
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>The President is, however, of the opinion that, without the
                                adjustment of a class of questions not alluded to in your note, the
                                proposed High Commission would fail to establish the permanent
                                relations and the sincere, substantial, and lasting friendship
                                between the two Governments which, in common with Her Majesty’s
                                Government, he desires should prevail.</p>
                            <p>He thinks that the removal of the differences which arose during the
                                rebellion in the United States, and which have existed since then,
                                growing out of the acts committed by the several vessels which have
                                given rise to the claims generically known as the “Alabama” claims,
                                will also be essential to the restoration of cordial and amicable
                                relations between the two Governments. He directs me to say that
                                should Her Majesty’s Government accept this view of the matter, and
                                assent that this subject also may be treated of by the proposed High
                                Commission, and may thus be put in the way of a final and amicable
                                settlement, this Government will, with much pleasure, appoint High
                                Commissioners on the part of the United States, to meet those who
                                may be appointed on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, and will
                                spare no efforts to secure, at the earliest practical moment, a just
                                and amicable arrangement of all the questions which now
                                unfortunately stand in the way of an entire and abiding friendship
                                between the two nations.</p>

                                by the name of the “Alabama” claims were submitted to the
                                consideration of the same High Commission by which Her Majesty’s
                                Government have proposed that the questions relating to the British
                                possessions in North America should be discussed, provided that all

                                this country, are similarly referred to the same Commission. The
                                expressions made use of in the name of the President in your
                                above-mentioned note, with regard to the “Alabama” claims, convince

                                importance that these causes of disputes between the two countries
                                should also, and at the same time, be done away with, and that you
                                will enable me to convey to my Government the assent of the
                                President to the addition which they thus propose to the duties of

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your note of the 1st instant, in which you inform me that
                                you are authorized by Earl Granville to state that it would give Her
                                Majesty’s Government great satisfaction if the claims com in only
                                known by the name of the “Alabama claims “were submitted to the
                                consideration of the same High Commission by which Her Majesty’s
                                Government have proposed that the questions relations to the British
                                possessions in North America should be discussed, provided that all
                                other claims, both of British subjects and citizens of the United
                                States, arising out of acts committed during the recent civil war in
                                this country, are similarly referred to the same Commission.</p>
                            <p>I have laid your note before the President, and he has directed me to
                                express the satisfaction with which he has received the intelligence
                                that Earl Granville has authorized you to state that Her Majesty’s
                                Government has accepted the views of this Government as to the
                                disposition to be made of the so-called “Alabama claims.”</p>
                            <p>He also directs me to say, with reference to the remainder of your
                                note, that if there be other and further claims of British subejcts,
                                or of American citizens, growing out of acts committed during the
                                recent civil war in this country, he assents to the propriety of
                                their reference to the same High Commission; but he suggests that
                                the High Commissioners shall consider only such claims of this
                                description as may be presented <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386"

                                an early day, to be agreed upon by the Commissioners.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your
                                obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>The High Commissioners having met, the protocol of the conference held on
                            the 3d of May was read and confirmed.</p>
                        <p>The High Commissioners then proceeded with the consideration of the
                            matters referred to them.</p>

                        <p>The Statement prepared by the Joint Protocolists, in accordance with the
                            request of the Joint High Commissioners at the last conference, was then
                            read as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">STATEMENTS.</p>

                        <p>At the conference held on the eighth of March the American Commissioners
                            stated that the people and Government of the United States felt that
                            they had sustained a great wrong, and that great injuries and losses
                            were inflicted upon their commerce and their material interests by the
                            course and conduct of Great Britain during the recent rebellion in the
                            United States; that what had occurred in Great Britain and her colonies
                            during that period had given rise to feelings in the United States which
                            the people of the United States did not desire to cherish to ward Great
                            Britain; that the history of the Alabama and other cruisers which had
                            been fitted out, or armed, or equipped, or which had received
                            augmentation of force in Great Britain or in her colonies, and of the
                            operations of those vessels, showed extensive direct losses in the
                            capture and destruction of a large number of vessels with their cargoes,
                            and in the heavy national expenditures in the pursuit of the cruisers,
                            and indirect injury in the transfer of a large part of the American
                            commercial marine to the British flag, in the enhanced payments of
                            insurance, in the prolongation of the war, and in the addition of a
                            large sum to the cost of the war and the suppression of the rebellion;
                            and also showed that Great Britain, by reason of failure in the proper
                            observance of her duties as a neutral, had become justly liable for the
                            acts of those cruisers and of their tenders; that the claims for the
                            loss and destruction of private property which had thus far been
                            presented amounted to about fourteen millions of dollars, without
                            interest, which amount was liable to be greatly increased by claims
                            which had not been presented; that the cost to which the Government had
                            been put in the pursuit of cruisers could easily be ascertained by
                            certificates of Government accounting officers; that in the hope of an
                            amicable settlement no estimate was made of the indirect losses, without
                            prejudice, however, to the right to indemnification on their account in
                            the event of no such settlement being made.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners further stated that they hoped that the
                            British Commissioners would be able to place upon record an expression
                            of regret by Her Majesty’s Government for the depredations committed by
                            the vessels whose acts were now under discussion. They also proposed
                            that the Joint High Commission should agree upon a sum which should be
                            paid by Great Britain to the United States, in satisfaction of all the
                            claims and the interest thereon.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that Her Majesty’s Government could not
                            admit that Great Britain had failed to discharge toward the United
                            States the duties imposed on her by the rules of International Law, or
                            that she was justly liable to make good to the United States the losses
                            occasioned by the acts of the cruisers to which the American
                            Commissioners had referred. They reminded the American Commissioners
                            that several vessels, suspected of being designed to cruise against the
                            United States, including two ironclads, had been arrested or detained by
                            the British Government, and that that Government had in some instances
                            not confined itself to the discharge of international obligations,
                            however widely construed, as, for instance, when it acquired at <pb
                                n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0455"/>a great cost to the country the
                            control of the Anglo-Chinese Flotilla, which, it was apprehended, might
                            be used against the United States.</p>
                        <p>They added that although Great Britain had, from the beginning, disavowed
                            any responsibility for the acts of the Alabama and the other vessels,
                            she had already shown her willingness, for the sake of the maintenance
                            of friendly relations with the United States, to adopt the principle of
                            arbitration, provided that a fitting Arbitrator could be found, and that
                            an agreement could be come to as to the points to which arbitration
                            should apply. They would, therefore, abstain from replying in detail to
                            the statement of the American Commissioners, in the hope that the
                            necessity for entering upon a lengthened controversy might be obviated
                            by the adoption of so fair a mode of settlement as that which they were
                            instructed to propose; and they had now to repeat, on behalf of their
                            Government, the offer of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners expressed their regret at this decision of the
                            British Commissioners, and said further that they could not consent to
                            submit the question of the liability of Her Majesty’s Government to
                            arbitration unless the principles which should govern the Arbitrator in
                            the consideration of the facts could be first agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that they had no authority to agree to
                            a submission of these claims to an Arbitrator with instructions as to
                            the principles which should govern him in the consideration of them.
                            They said that they should be willing to consider what principles should
                            be adopted for observance in future; but that they were of opinion that
                            the best mode of conducting an arbitration was to submit the facts to
                            the Arbitrator, and leave him free to decide upon them after hearing
                            such arguments as might be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were willing to consider
                            what principles should be laid down for observance in similar cases in
                            future, with the understanding that any principles that should be agreed
                            upon should be held to be applicable to the facts in respect to the
                            Alabama Claims.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that they could not admit that there
                            had been any violation of existing principles of International Law, and
                            that their instructions did not authorize them to accede to a proposal
                            for laying down rules for the guidance of the Arbitrator, but that they
                            would make known to their Government the views of the American
                            Commissioners on the subject.</p>
                        <p>At the respective conferences on March 9, March 10, March 13, and March
                            14, the Joint High Commission considered the form of the declaration of
                            principles or rules which the American Commissioners desired to see
                            adopted for the instruction of the Arbitrator and laid down for
                            observance by the two Governments in future.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conference of the 14th of March the British
                            Commissioners reserved several questions for the consideration of their
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 5th of April the British Commissioners stated
                            that they were instructed by Her Majesty’s Government to declare that
                            Her Majesty’s Government could not assent to the proposed rules as a
                            statement of principles of International Law which were in force at the
                            time when the Alabama Claims arose, but that Her Majesty’s Government,
                            in order to evince its desire of strengthening the friendly relations
                            between the two countries and of making satisfactory provision for the
                            future, agreed that in deciding the questions between the two countries
                            arising out of those claims, the Arbitrator should assume that Her
                            Majesty’s Government had undertaken to act upon the <pb n="398"
                                xml:id="pg_398" facs="0456"/>principles set forth in the rules which
                            the American Commissioners had proposed, viz:</p>
                        <p>That a neutral Government is hound, first, to use due diligence to
                            prevent the fitting out, arming, or equipping, within its jurisdiction,
                            of any vessel which it has reasonable ground to believe is intended to
                            cruise or carry on war against a power with which it is at peace; and
                            also to use like diligence to prevent the departure from its
                            jurisdiction of any vessel intended to cruise or carry on war as above,
                            such vessel having been specially adapted, in whole or in part, within
                            such jurisdiction, to warlike use.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Secondly. Not to permit of suffer either belligerent to make use
                                of its ports or waters as the base of naval operations against the
                                other, or for the purpose of the renewal or augmentation of military
                                supplies or arms, or the recruitment of men.</item>
                            <item>Thirdly. To exercise due diligence in its own ports or waters, and
                                as to all persons within its jurisdiction, to prevent any violation
                                of the foregoing obligations and duties.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It being a condition of this undertaking, that these obligations should
                            in future be held to be binding internationally between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>It was also settled that in deciding the matters submitted to him the
                            Arbitrator should be governed by the foregoing rules, which had been
                            agreed upon as rules to be taken as applicable to the case, and by such
                            principles of International Law, not inconsistent therewith, as the
                            Arbitrator should determine to have been applicable to the case.</p>
                        <p>The Joint High Commission then proceeded to consider the form of
                            submission and the manner of constituting a tribunal of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>At the conferences on the 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th of April the
                            Joint High Commission considered and discussed the form of submission,
                            the manner of the award, and the mode of selecting the Arbitrators.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners, referring to the hope which they had
                            expressed on the 8th of March, inquired whether the British
                            Commissioners were prepared to place upon record an expression of regret
                            by Her Majesty’s Government for the depredations committed by the
                            vessels whose acts were now under discussion; and the British
                            Commissioners replied that they were authorized to express, in a
                            friendly spirit, the regret felt by Her Majesty’s Government for the
                            escape, under whatever circumstances, of the Alabama and other vessels
                            from British ports, and for the depredations committed by those
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners accepted this expression of regret as very
                            satisfactory to them and as a token of kindness, and said that they felt
                            sure it would be so received by the Government and people of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In the conference on the 13th of April the Treaty Articles I to XI were
                            agreed to.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XII to XVII.</hi></p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 4th of March it was agreed to consider the
                            subjects referred to the Joint High Commission by the respective
                            Governments in the order in which they appeared in the correspondence
                            between Sir Edward Thornton and Mr. Fish, and to defer the consideration
                            of the adjustment of “all other claims, both of British subjects and
                            citizens of the United States, arising out of acts committed during the
                            recent civil war in this country,’’ as described by Sir Edward Thornton
                                <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0457"/>in his letter of February
                            1, until the subjects referred to in the previous letters should have
                            been disposed of.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners said that they supposed that they were right
                            in their opinion that British laws prohibit British subjects from owning
                            slaves; they therefore inquired whether any claims for slaves, or for
                            alleged property or interest in slaves, can or will be presented by the
                            British Government, or in behalf of any British subject, under the
                            Treaty now being negotiated, if there be in the Treaty no express words
                            excluding such claims.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that by the law of England British
                            subjects had long been prohibited from purchasing or dealing in slaves,
                            not only within the dominions of the British Crown but in any foreign
                            country; and that they had no hesitation in saying that no claim on
                            behalf of any British subject, for slaves or for any property or
                            interest in slaves, would be presented by the British Government.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the paragraph in Sir Edward Thornton’s letter of January 26,
                            relating to “the mode of settling the different questions which have
                            arisen out of the Fisheries, as well as all those which affect the
                            relations of the United States towards Her Majesty’s Possessions in
                            North America,” the British Commissioners proposed that the Joint High
                            Commission should consider the claims for injuries which the people of
                            Canada had suffered from what were known as the Fenian raids.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners objected to this, and it was agreed that the
                            subject might be brought up again by the British Commissioners in
                            connection with the subject referred to by Sir Edward Thornton in his
                            letter of February 1.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 14th of April the Joint High Commission took
                            into consideration the subjects mentioned by Sir Edward Thornton in that
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners proposed that a Commission for the
                            consideration of these claims should be appointed, and that the
                            Convention of 1853 should be followed as a precedent. This was agreed
                            to, except that it was settled that there should be a third Commissioner
                            instead of an Umpire.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 15th of April the Treaty Articles XII to XVII
                            were agreed to.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 26th of April the British Commissioners again
                            brought before the Joint High Commission the claims of the people of
                            Canada for injuries suffered from the Fenian raids. They said that they
                            were instructed to present these claims and to state that they were
                            regarded by Her Majesty’s Government as coming within the class of
                            subjects indicated by Sir Edward Thornton in his letter of January 26,
                            as subjects for the consideration of the Joint High Commission.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were instructed to say that
                            the Government of the United States did not regard these claims as
                            coming within the class of subjects indicated in that letter as subjects
                            for the consideration of the Joint High Commission, and that they were
                            without any authority from their Government to consider them. They
                            therefore declined to do so.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners stated that, as the subject was understood not
                            to be within the scope of the instructions of the American
                            Commissioners, they must refer to their Government for further
                            instructions upon it.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 3d of May the British Commissioners stated that
                            they were instructed by their Government to express their regret that
                            the American Commissioners were without authority to deal with <pb
                                n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0458"/>the question of the Fenian
                            raids, and they inquired whether that was still the case.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that they could see no reason to vary
                            the reply formerly given to this proposal; that in their view the
                            subject was not embraced in the scope of the correspondence between Sir
                            Edward Thornton and Mr. Fish under either of the letters of the former;
                            and that they did not feel justified in entering upon the consideration
                            of any class of claims not contemplated at the time of the creation of
                            the present Commission, and that the claims now referred to did not
                            commend themselves to their favor.</p>
                        <p>The British High Commissioners said that under these circumstances they
                            would not urge further that the settlement of these claims should be
                            included in the present treaty, and that they had the less difficulty in
                            doing so, as a portion of the claims were of a constructive and
                            inferential character.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XVIII to XXV</hi>.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 6th of March the British Commissioners stated
                            that they were prepared to discuss the question of the Fisheries, either
                            in detail or generally, so as either to enter into an examination of the
                            respective rights of the two countries under the Treaty of 1818 and the
                            general law of nations, or to approach at once the settlement of the
                            question on a comprehensive basis.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners said that with the view of avoiding the
                            discussion of matters which subsequent negotiation might render it
                            unnecessary to enter into, they thought it would be preferable to adopt
                            the latter course, and inquired what, in that case, would be the basis
                            which the British Commissioners desired to propose.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that they considered that the
                            Reciprocity Treaty of June 5, 1854, should be restored in principle.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners declined to assent to a renewal of the former
                            reciprocity treaty.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners then suggested that, if any considerable
                            modification were made in the tariff arrangements of that Treaty, the
                            coasting trade of the United States and of Her Britannic Majesty’s
                            Possessions in North America should be reciprocally thrown open, and
                            that the navigation of the River Saint Lawrence and of the Canadian
                            Canals should be also thrown open to the citizens of the United States
                            on terms of equality with British subjects.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners declined this proposal, and objected to a
                            negotiation on the basis of the Reciprocity Treaty. They said that that
                            Treaty had proved unsatisfactory to the people of the United States, and
                            consequently had been terminated by notice from the Government of the
                            United States, in pursuance of its provisions. Its renewal was not in
                            their interest, and would not be in accordance with the sentiments of
                            their people. They further said that they were not at liberty to treat
                            of the opening of the coasting trade of the United States to the
                            subjects of Her Majesty residing in her Possessions in North America, It
                            was agreed that the questions relating to the navigation of the River
                            Saint Lawrence, and of the Canadian Canals, and to other commercial
                            questions affecting Canada, should be treated by themselves.</p>
                        <p>The subject of the Fisheries was further discussed at the conferences on
                            the 7th, 20th, 22d, and 25th of March. The American Commissioners stated
                            that if the value of the inshore fisheries could be ascertained, the
                            United States might prefer to purchase, for a sum of money, the right
                                <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0459"/>to enjoy, in perpetuity,
                            the use of these inshore fisheries in common with British fishermen, and
                            mentioned one million dollars as the sum they were prepared to offer.
                            The British Commissioners replied that this offer was, they thought,
                            wholly inadequate, and that no arrangement would be acceptable of which
                            the admission into the United States free of duty of fish, the produce
                            of the British fisheries, did not form a part, adding that any
                            arrangement for the acquisition by purchase of the inshore fisheries in
                            perpetuity was open to grave objection.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners inquired whether it would be necessary to
                            refer any arrangement for purchase to the Colonial or Provincial
                            Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners explained that the Fisheries within the limits
                            of maritime jurisdiction were the property of the several British
                            Colonies, and that it would be necessary to refer any arrangement which
                            might affect Colonial property or rights to the Colonial or Provincial
                            Parliament; and that legislation would also be required on the part of
                            the Imperial Parliament.</p>
                        <p>During these discussions the British Commissioners contended that these
                            inshore fisheries were of great value, and that the most satisfactory
                            arrangement for their use would be a reciprocal tariff arrangement, and
                            reciprocity in the coasting trade; and the American Commissioners
                            replied that their value was overestimated; that the United States
                            desired to secure their enjoyment, not for their commercial or intrinsic
                            value, but for the purpose of removing a source of irritation; and that
                            they could hold out no hope that the Congress of the United States would
                            give its assent to such a tariff arrangement as was proposed, or to any
                            extended plan of reciprocal free admission of the products of the two
                            countries; but that, inasmuch as one branch of Congress had recently,
                            more than once, expressed itself in favor of the abolition of duties on
                            coal and salt, they would propose that coal, salt, and fish be
                            reciprocally admitted free; and, that, inasmuch as Congress had removed
                            the duty from a portion of the lumber heretofore subject to duty, and as
                            the tendency of legislation in the United States was toward the
                            reduction of taxation and of duties in proportion to the reduction of
                            the public debt and expenses, they would further propose that lumber be
                            admitted free from duty from and after the first of July, 1874, subject
                            to the approval of Congress, which was necessary on all questions
                            affecting import duties.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners, at the conference on the 17th of April, stated
                            that they had referred this offer to their Government, and were
                            instructed to inform the American Commissioners that it was regarded as
                            inadequate, and that Her Majesty’s Government considered that free
                            lumber should be granted at once, and that the proposed tariff
                            concessions should be supplemented by a money payment.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners then stated that they withdrew the proposal
                            which they had previously made of the reciprocal free admission of coal,
                            salt, and fish, and of lumber after July 1, 1874; that that proposal had
                            been made entirely in the interest of a peaceful settlement, and for the
                            purpose of removing a source of irritation and of anxiety; that its
                            value had been beyond the commercial or intrinsic value of the rights to
                            have been acquired in return; and that they could not consent to an
                            arrangement on the basis now proposed by the British Commissioners; and
                            they renewed their proposal to pay a money equivalent for the use of the
                            inshore fisheries. They further proposed that, in case the two
                            Governments should not be able to agree upon the sum to be paid as such
                            an equivalent, the matter should be referred to an impartial Commission
                            for determination.</p>
                        <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0460"/>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that this proposal was one on which
                            they had no instructions, and that it would not be possible for them to
                            come to any arrangement except one for a term of years and involving the
                            concession of free fish and fish-oil by the American Commissioners; but
                            that if free fish and fish-oil were conceded, they would inquire of
                            their Government whether they were prepared to assent to a reference to
                            arbitration as to money payment.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were willing, subject to the
                            action of Congress, to concede free fish and fish-oil as an equivalent
                            for the use of the inshore fisheries, and to make the arrangement for a
                            term of years; that they were of the opinion that free fish and fish-oil
                            would be more than an equivalent for those fisheries, but that they were
                            also willing to agree to a reference to determine that question and the
                            amount of any money payment that might be found necesssary to complete
                            an equivalent, it being understood that legislation would be needed
                            before any payment could be made.</p>
                        <p>The subject was further discussed in the conferences of April 18 and 19,
                            and the British Commissioners having referred the last proposal to their
                            Government and received instructions to accept it, the Treaty Articles
                            XVIII to XXV were agreed to at the conference on the 22d of April.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XXVI to XXXIII.</hi></p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 6th of March the British Commissioners proposed
                            that the Reciprocity Treaty of June 5, 1854, should be restored in
                            principle, and that, if any considerable modifications in the tariff
                            arrangements in force under it were made, the coasting trade of the
                            United States and of Her Britannic Majesty’s Possessions in North
                            America should be reciprocally thrown open, and that the navigation of
                            the River St. Lawrence and of the Canadian Canals should be thrown open
                            to the citizens of the United States on terms of equality with British
                            subjects.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners declined this proposal, and in the subsequent
                            negotiations the question of the Fisheries was treated by itself.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 17th of March the Joint High Commission
                            considered the subject of the American improvement of the navigation of
                            the Saint Clair Flats.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 18th of March the questions of the navigation of
                            the River Saint Lawrence and the Canals and the other subjects connected
                            therewith were taken up.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners proposed to take into consideration the
                            question of transit of goods in bond through Canada and the United
                            States, which was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners proposed to take into consideration the
                            question of opening the coasting trade of the lakes reciprocally to each
                            party, which was declined.</p>
                        <p>On the proposal of the British Commissioners it was agreed to take the
                            question of transshipment into consideration.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners proposed to take into consideration the
                            reciprocal registration of vessels, as between the Dominion of Canada
                            and the United States, which was declined.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 23d of March the transshipment question was
                            discussed, and postponed for further information, on the motion of the
                            American Commissioners.</p>
                        <p>The transit question was discussed, and it was agreed that any settlement
                                <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0461"/>that might be made should
                            include a reciprocal arrangement in that respect for the period for
                            which the Fishery articles should be in force.</p>
                        <p>The question of the navigation of the River Saint Lawrence and the Canals
                            was taken up.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners stated that they regarded the concession of the
                            navigation of Lake Michigan as an equivalent for the concession of the
                            navigation of the River Saint Lawrence.</p>
                        <p>As to the Canals, they stated that the concession of the privilege to
                            navigate them in their present condition, on terms of equality with
                            British subjects, was a much greater concession than the corresponding
                            use of the Canals offered by the United States.</p>
                        <p>They further said that the enlargement of the Canals would involve the
                            expenditure of a large amount of money, and they asked what equivalent
                            the American Commissioners proposed to give for the surrender of the
                            right to control the tolls for the use of the Canals, either in their
                            present state or after enlargement.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied, that unless the Well and Canal should
                            be enlarged so as to accommodate the present course of trade, they
                            should not be disposed to make any concessions; that in their opinion
                            the citizens of the United States could now justly claim to navigate the
                            River St. Lawrence in its natural state, ascending and descending, from
                            the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude, where it ceases to form the
                            boundary between the two countries, from, to, and into the sea; and they
                            could not concede that the navigation of Lake Michigan should be given
                            or taken as an equivalent for that right; and they thought that the
                            concession of the navigation of Lake Michigan and of the Canals offered
                            by them was more than an equivalent for the concessions as to the
                            Canadian Canals which were asked. They proposed, in connection with a
                            reciprocal arrangement as to transit and transshipment, that Canada
                            should agree to enlarge the Welland and St. Lawrence Canals, to make no
                            discriminating tolls, and to limit the tolls to rates sufficient to
                            maintain the Canals, pay a reasonable interest on the cost of
                            construction and enlargement, and raise a sinking-fund for the repaying,
                            within a reasonable time, the cost of enlargement; and that the
                            navigation of the River St. Lawrence, the Canadian Canals, the Canals
                            offered by the United States, and Lake Michigan should be enjoyed
                            reciprocally by citizens of the United States and by British subjects.
                            This proposal was declined by the British Commissioners, who repeated
                            that they did not regard the equivalent offered by the United States as
                            at all commensurate with the concessions asked from Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 27th of March the proposed enlargement of the
                            Canadian Canals was further discussed. It was stated on the part of the
                            British Commissioners that the Canadian Government were now considering
                            the expediency of enlarging the capacity of the Canals on the River St.
                            Lawrence, and had already provided for the enlargement of the Welland
                            Canal, which would be undertaken without delay.</p>
                        <p>The subject of the export duty in New Brunswick on American lumber
                            floated down the River St. John, was proposed for consideration by the
                            American Commissioners.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 22d of April the British Commissioners proposed
                            that the navigation of Lake Michigan should be given in exchange for the
                            navigation of the River St. Lawrence; and that Her Majesty’s Government
                            should agree to urge upon the Dominion of Canada to give to the citizens
                            of the United States the use of the Canadian Canals on <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0462"/>terms of equality with British
                            subjects; and that the Government of the United States should agree to
                            urge upon the several States to give to British subjects the use of the
                            several State Canals on terms of equality with citizens of the United
                            States. They also proposed, as part of the arrangement, a reciprocal
                            agreement as to transit and transshipment, and that the Government of
                            Great Britain should urge upon New Brunswick not to impose export duties
                            on the lumber floated down the River St. John for shipment to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners repeated their views as to the navigation of
                            the River St. Lawrence in its natural state.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that they could not admit the claims of
                            American citizens to navigate the River St. Lawrence as of right; but
                            that the British Government had no desire to exclude them from it. They,
                            however, pointed out that there were certain rivers running through
                            Alaska which should on like grounds be declared free and open to British
                            subjects, in case the River St. Lawrence should be declared free.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were prepared to consider
                            that question. They also assented to the arrangement as to the canals,
                            which was proposed by the British Commissioners, limiting it, as
                            regarded American Canals, to the canals connected with the navigation of
                            the lakes or rivers traversed by or contiguous to the boundary-line
                            between the British and American possessions. They likewise agreed to
                            give the right of navigating Lake Michigan for a term of years. They
                            desired, and it was agreed, that the transshipment arrangement should be
                            made dependent upon the non-existence of discriminating tolls or
                            regulations on the Canadian Canals, and also upon the abolition of the
                            New Brunswick export duty on American lumber intended for the United
                            States. It was also agreed that the right of carrying should be made
                            dependent upon the non-imposition of export duties on either side on the
                            goods of the other party passing in transit.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of these subjects was further continued at the conferences
                            of the 24th, 25th, and 26th of April, and the Treaty Articles XXVI to
                            XXXIII were agreed to at the conference on the 3d of May.</p>
                        <p>In the course of these discussions the British Commissioners called
                            attention to the question of the survey of the boundary-line along the
                            forty-ninth parallel, which still remained unexecuted from the Lake of
                            the Woods to the Rocky Mountains, and to which reference had been made
                            in the President’s Message.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners stated that the survey was a matter for
                            administrative action, and did not require to be dealt with by a treaty
                            provision. The United States Government would be prepared to agree with
                            the British Government for the appointment of a boundary survey
                            commission in the same manner as had been done in regard to the
                            remainder of the boundary along the forty-ninth parallel as soon as the
                            legislative appropriations and other necessary arrangements could be
                            made.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XXXIV to XLII</hi>.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 15th of March the British Commissioners stated
                            that it was proposed that day to take up the Northwest water-boundary
                            question; that the difference was one of long standing, which had more
                            than once been the subject of negotiations between the two Governments,
                            and that the negotiators had, in January, 1869, agreed upon a treaty.
                            They then proposed that an arbitration of this question should be made
                            upon the basis of the provisions of that Treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that, though no formal vote was
                            actually taken upon it, it was well understood that that Treaty had not
                            been favorably regarded by the Senate. They declined the proposal of the
                            British Commissioners, and expressed their wish that an effort should be
                            made to settle the question in the Joint High Commission.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners assented to this, and presented the reasons
                            which induced them to regard the Rosario Straits as the channel
                            contemplated by the Treaty of June 15, 1846.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied, and presented the reasons which
                            induced them to regard the Haro Channel as the channel contemplated by
                            that Treaty. They also produced in support of their views some original
                            correspondence of Mr. Everett with his Government, which had not been
                            alluded to in previous discussions of the question.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that they saw in that correspondence no
                            reason to induce them to change the opinion which they had previously
                            expressed. They then asked whether the American Commissioners had any
                            further proposal to make.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that, in view of the position taken by
                            the British Commissioners, it appeared that the Treaty of June 15, 1846,
                            might have been made under a mutual misunderstanding, and would not have
                            been made had each party understood at that time the construction which
                            the other party puts upon the language whose interpretation is in
                            dispute; they therefore proposed to abrogate the whole of that part of
                            the Treaty, and re-arrange the boundary-line which was in dispute before
                            that Treaty was concluded.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners replied that the proposal to abrogate a treaty
                            was one of a serious character, and that they had no instructions which
                            would enable them to entertain it; and at the conference on the 20th of
                            March the British Commissioners declined the proposal.</p>
                        <p>At the conference on the 19th of April the British Commissioners proposed
                            to the American Commissioners to adopt the Middle Channel (generally
                            known as the Douglas Channel) as the channel through which the
                            boundary-line should be run, with the understanding that all the
                            channels through the Archipelago should be free and common to both
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners declined to entertain that proposal. They
                            proposed that the Joint High Commission should recognize the Haro
                            Channel as the channel intended by the Treaty of June 15, 1846, with a
                            mutual agreement that no fortifications should be erected by either
                            party to obstruct or command it, and with proper provisions as to any
                            existing proprietary rights of British subjects in the island of San
                            Juan.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners declined this proposal, and stated that, being
                            convinced of the justice of their view of the Treaty, they could not
                            abandon it except after a fair decision by an impartial arbitrator. They
                            therefore renewed their proposal for a reference to arbitration, and
                            hoped that it would be seriously considered.</p>
                        <p>The American Commissioners replied that they had hoped that their last
                            proposal would be accepted. As it had been declined, they would, should
                            the other questions between the two Governments be satisfactorily
                            adjusted, agree to a reference to arbitration to determine whether the
                            line should run through the Haro Channel or through the Rosario Straits,
                            upon the condition that either Government should have the right to
                            include in the evidence to be considered by the Arbitrator such
                            documents, official correspondence, and other official or public
                            statements, bearing on the subject of the reference, as they may
                            consider <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0464"/>necessary to the
                            support of their respective cases. This condition was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners proposed that the Arbitrator should have the
                            right to draw the boundary through an intermediate channel. The American
                            Commissioners declined this proposal, stating that they desired a
                            decision, not a compromise.</p>
                        <p>The British Commissioners proposed that it should be declared to be the

                            be open to navigation by both parties. The American Commissioners stated
                            that they did not so construe the Treaty of 1846, and therefore could
                            not assent to such a declaration.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of this subject was continued during this conference, and
                            in the conference of the 22d of April the Treaty Articles XXXIV to XLII
                            were agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The Joint High Commissioners approved this statement, and directed it to
                            be entered in the protocol.</p>
                        <p>The conference was adjourned to the 6th of May.</p>

                        <p>The High Commissioners having met, the protocol of the conference held on
                            the 4th of May was read and confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Lord de Grey said, that as the Joint High Commission would not meet again
                            after to-day, except for the purpose of signing the Treaty, he desired,
                            on behalf of himself and his colleagues, to express their high
                            appreciation of the manner in which Mr. Fish and his American colleagues
                            had, on their side, conducted the negotiations. It had been most
                            gratifying to the British Commissioners to be associated with colleagues
                            who were animated with the same sincere desire as themselves to bring
                            about a settlement, equally honorable and just to both countries, of the
                            various questions of which it had been their duty to treat, and the
                            British Commissioners would always retain a grateful recollection of the
                            fair and friendly spirit which the American Commissioners had
                            displayed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fish, in behalf of the American Commissioners, said that they were
                            gratefully sensible of the friendly words expressed by Lord de Grey, and
                            of the kind spirit which had prompted them. From the date of the first
                            conference the American Commissioners had been impressed by the
                            earnestness of desire manifested by the British Commissioners to reach a
                            settlement worthy of the two Powers who had committed to this Joint High
                            Commission the treatment of various questions of peculiar interest,
                            complexity, and delicacy. His colleagues and he could never cease to
                            appreciate the generous spirit, and the open and friendly manner in
                            which the British Commissioners had met and discussed the several
                            questions that had led to the conclusion of a Treaty which it was hoped
                            would receive the approval of the people of both countries, and would
                            prove the foundation of a cordial and friendly understanding between
                            them for all time to come.</p>
                        <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0465"/>
                        <p>Mr. Fish farther said that he was sure that every member of the Joint
                            High Commission would desire to record his appreciation of the ability,
                            the zeal, and the unceasing labor which the Joint Protocolists had
                            exhibited in the discharge of their arduous and responsible duties, and
                            that he knew that he only gave expression to the feelings of the
                            Commissioners in saying that Lord Tenterden and Mr. Bancroft Davis were
                            entitled to, and were requested to accept the thanks of, the Joint High
                            Commission for their valuable services, and the great assistance which
                            they had rendered with unvarying obligingness to the Commission.</p>
                        <p>Lord de Grey replied, on behalf of the British Commissioners, that he and
                            his colleagues most cordially concurred in the proposal made by Mr. Fish
                            that the thanks of the Joint High Commission should be tendered to Mr.
                            Bancroft Davis and Lord Tenterden for their valuable services as Joint
                            Protocolists. The British Commissioners were also full as sensible as
                            their American colleagues of the great advantage which the Commission
                            had derived from the assistance which those gentlemen had given them in
                            the conduct of the important negotiations in which they had been
                            engaged.</p>
                        <p>Monday, the 8th of May, was appointed for the signatures of the
                            Treaty.</p>
