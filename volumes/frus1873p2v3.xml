                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In submitting the accompanying report of
                            the proceedings and results of the mixed commission under the twelfth
                            article of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of May
                            8, 1871, I beg to express my profound sense of obligation to yourself
                            for the uniform kindness and consideration I have experienced from you
                            during the whole existence of the commission.</p>
                        <p>The two years and more of my connection with the commission were years of
                            severe and unremitting labor. The nearly five hundred claims presented
                            to and passed on by the commission involved an immense range of
                            investigation, proofs, and arguments. The transactions out of which they
                            grew extended through four years of time, and involved not only
                            inquiries into the whole history of the late war in its operations on
                            land, but also a large extent of maritime operations, warlike and
                            commercial, and extensive inquiries into the transactions between the
                            late so-called Confederate States and subjects of the neutral nations of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>The proofs on the part of the claimants and of the defence, respectively,
                            were sought through the archives of all the Departments of our own
                            Government, as well as those of the late confederate government in our
                            hands. Testimony of witnesses was taken on notice, and either on written
                            interrogatories or on oral examinations by counsel attending in person,
                            in almost every State and Territory of the United States, in all the
                            British provinces of North America, in Mexico, in several of the West
                            India Islands, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and in Egypt. This
                            testimony was taken, in all the cases of British claims against the
                            United States, either by special counsel sent under my instructions from
                            Washington, or by local counsel employed in the vicinity where testimony
                            was to be taken. In each of these cases counsel acted under written
                            instructions from myself, as full and specific as a careful examination
                            of each case could enable me to give.</p>
                        <p>The few cases of American claims against Great Britain were managed in
                            regard to testimony and arguments, by the private counsel of the
                            claimants, I rendering only a general aid and supervision, but not
                            assuming the responsibility either of taking the proofs or preparing the
                            arguments.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0060"/>
                        <p>But in the claims of British subjects against the United States,
                            involving about 90 per cent, in amount of the entire claims before the
                            commission, the sole control and responsibility rested upon me.</p>
                        <p>These claims involved about $96,000,000, ranging through an almost
                            infinite variety of facts and circumstances involved in the support of
                            or defence against the claims. The claim as presented by the claimant in
                            his memorial and proofs often gave the first and only information to the
                            Government of the existence even of the claim, and involved an inquiry
                            into the facts of the case through very circuitous and difficult
                            channels. In such cases the Government always stands at a great
                            disadvantage as against private claimants, who have full knowledge of
                            all the circumstances of their own claims, when actual and <hi
                                rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, and of the proofs by which they may be
                            established, and who, in the case of fraudulent, simulated, or excessive
                            claims, have facilities in the manufacture of evidence often very
                            difficult to be exposed or rebutted by the agents charged with the
                            defence of the Government, and acting through secondary agents often at
                            remote and almost inaccessible points.</p>
                        <p>In view of the number and amount of the claims presented, and the
                            importance of the questions to be determined, the time limited by the
                            treaty for their examination and decision was very short. Two years for
                            the complete examination, trial, and decision of all these cases, nine
                            months of which time was allowed (six absolutely, and three under
                            limitation) for the presentation of the claims by the claimant,
                            constituted a shorter time than should have been taken for the thorough
                            and satisfactory examination of all the cases.</p>
                        <p>The fact that in this scanty time the Government was enabled to make the
                            examination and trial of the cases as thorough as it was made, and to
                            arrive at results so satisfactory, is certainly a subject of
                            congratulation, the awards made by the commission against the United
                            States amounting to only about two per cent, of the claims presented to
                            the commission against them.</p>
                        <p>The entire expense of the commission incurred by the United States,
                            including compensation of commissioners and officers of the commission,
                            of the agent and counsel before the commission and his assistants and
                            clerks, of counsel, agents, commissioners, witnesses, &amp;c, in taking
                            testimony, and also printing and incidental expenses, has been about
                            $300,000, of which amount about $50,000 will be reimbursed by the
                            deduction from the amount of the awards, pursuant to article XVI of the
                            treaty. All the memorials, evidence, and arguments were printed for the
                            use of the commission, the expense of printing being borne jointly and
                            equally by the two governments. The entire printed matter thus
                            submitted, and now collated and bound, makes up seventy-four octavo
                            volumes, averaging about 800 pages each.</p>
                        <p>In an early case before the commission, involving the question of the
                            effect of domicile within the United States upon subjects of Great
                            Britain, by paramount allegiance, domiciled within the United States,
                                <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0061"/>Hon. Ebenezer Rock wood Hoar,
                            of Massachusetts, was retained by the Government at my request as
                            associate counsel, and filed a very learned and valuable argument. In a
                            few other cases, not exceeding fifty in all, I was assisted in the
                            preparation of arguments by Gen. Benjamin S. Roberts and by Messrs.
                            Edwin L. Stanton and A. S. Worthington, of Washington, whose services
                            were faithfully rendered and were very valuable. With these exceptions
                            the arguments in all the British cases were prepared solely by
                            myself.</p>
                        <p>In the taking of testimony a large number of counsel and agents were
                            employed, under my supervision, in the localities where testimony was
                            taken as above related. Among those who have rendered faithful and
                            efficient service in this way, I deem it not invidious to mention
                            Messrs. Kortrecht, Graft &amp; Scales, of Memphis, Tenn.; Messrs. M. A.
                            Dooley and William G. Hale, of New Orleans, La.; Franklin H. Churchill,

                            Louisville, Ky.; Messrs. Bradley &amp; Peabody, of Nashville, Tenn.; and
                            General H. B. Titus, of Washington, D. C.</p>
                        <p>Thomas H. Dudley, esq., late consul of the United States, at Liverpool,
                            and Joseph N. Tunn, esq., United States vice consul-general at London,
                            also contributed largely, by their knowledge of the different cases, and
                            their diligence and assiduity in inquiry and report upon the claims, to
                            the successful defense of the United States against many of the prize
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, too, I should not fail to make mention of the
                            diligence, skill, and assiduity of Mr. Edward Hayes, my stenographic
                            clerk, during the whole period of my agency.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I cannot forbear the expression of my great satisfaction
                            with the working of the commission, its performance of its arduous
                            duties, and the result of its labors. The thanks of both governments
                            will undoubtedly be fully expressed to the individual commissioners.</p>
                        <p>My personal acknowledgments are especially due to his excellency Count
                            Corti, the presiding commissioner, for the marked and unfailing
                            courtesy, kindness, and consideration which I, in common with every
                            other person connected with the commission, received from him throughout
                            the whole period of our official intercourse. The wide knowledge of
                            public law, the sterling good sense and judgment in its application to
                            the facts of individual cases, the untiring labor bestowed in the
                            investigation alike of facts and principles, and the able, diligent, and
                            conscientious application of his powers, attainments, and labors to the
                            examination and decision of the cases before the commission, merit
                            recognition and acknowledgment from the governments so largely indebted
                            to him for the satisfactory disposition of the numerous vexed questions
                            between <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0062"/>them submitted to the
                            arbitrament of himself and his colleagues, to an extent to which, these
                            expressions of mine do scant and feeble justice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Justice Frazer, the commissioner named by the President of the United
                            States, by his ability, impartiality, urbanity, and diligence, fully
                            justified the wisdom of the President’s selection and the expectations
                            of those previously acquainted with his judicial abilities and
                            career.</p>
                        <p>I beg, also, to express my profound appreciation of the diligence,
                            faithfulness, and ability exhibited by Mr. Howard, Her Majesty’s agent,
                            and by Mr. Carlisle, Her Majesty’s counsel, in the management of the
                            cases before the commission on behalf of the British government, and to
                            acknowledge my personal obligations to each of those gentlemen for their
                            unfailing courtesy and fairness.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            established by the twelfth article of the treaty between the United
                            States and Great Britain of 8th May, 1871, respectfully submits the
                            following report of the proceedings and results of that commission:</p>
                        <p>Articles 12 to 17, inclusive, of the treaty above referred to, contain
                            the provisions establishing the commission and regulating its
                            jurisdiction, powers, and methods of proceeding. Those articles are
                            found in the appendix to this report, A.</p>
                        <p>The Honorable James Somerville Frazer, of the State of Indiana, formerly
                            a justice of the supreme court of that State, was named as commissioner
                            by the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Right Honorable Russell Gurney, member of Parliament, member of Her
                            Majesty’s privy council, and recorder of London, was named as
                            commissioner by Her Britannic Majesty.</p>
                        <p>Count Louis Corti, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to
                            the United States of His Majesty the King of Italy, was named as the

                            Britannic Majesty conjointly.</p>
                        <p>Robert Safford Hale, esq., of the State of New York, was named by the
                            President of the United States agent of the United States to attend the
                            commissioners, to present and support claims presented on behalf of his
                            Government, to answer claims made upon it, and to represent it generally
                            in all matters connected with the investigation and decision of such
                            claims, pursuant to the provisions of the thirteenth article of the
                            treaty. Mr. Hale acted also as counsel for the United States under the
                            same article.</p>
                        <p>Henry Howard, esq., one of Her Britannic Majesty’s secretaries of
                            legation at Washington, was named by Her Majesty’s government as the
                            agent of that government for the like purposes, pursuant to the same
                            article.</p>
                        <p>James Mandeville Carlisle, esq., of the city of Washington, U. S. A., was
                            employed as the counsel of Her Britannic Majesty’s government before the
                            commission.</p>
                        <p>The commissioners and agents and counsel above named continued in the
                            execution of their respective duties to the close of the commission.</p>

                        <p>The commission first met and organized at Washington on the 26th day of
                            September, 1871, each of the commissioners making and subscribing the
                            “solemn declaration” provided by the twelfth article of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Count Corti was requested, by vote of the commission, to preside during
                            its deliberations, and continued to act as presiding commissioner during
                            the entire existence of the commission.</p>
                        <p>Thomas Campbell Cox, esq., of the District of Columbia, U. S. A., was
                            duly appointed by the commission as its secretary, and continued to act
                            as such to the close of the commission.</p>
                        <p>The commission, at an early session, adopted rules for the course of
                            proceedings before it, including the manner of presentation,
                            prosecution, and defense of claims, the taking of testimony, and the
                            printing and presentation of the evidence and arguments, a copy of which
                            rules, with such slight modifications as were from time to time
                            afterward ad opted, is found in the appendix, B.</p>
                        <p>Within the time limited by the treaty, nineteen claims were presented on
                            the part of citizens of the United States against Great Britain,
                            aggregating, exclusive of interest, a little less than $1,000,000. These
                            claims, as will be seen by the detailed report hereinafter given, were
                            all disallowed by the commission.</p>
                        <p>Within the same time were presented four hundred and seventy-eight claims
                            of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty against the United States,
                            aggregating, exclusive of interest, about $60,000,000, and, including
                            interest for the average time allowed by the commission, about
                            $96,000,000. Of these claims, one was dismissed by the commission on
                            account of indecorous and improper language used in the memorial,
                            without prejudice to the filing of a new memorial, which was
                            subsequently filed; thirty were dismissed as not within the jurisdiction
                            of the commission; two hundred and fifty-eight were disallowed on the
                            merits; eight were withdrawn by Her Britannic Majesty’s agent, by leave
                            of the commission; and in one hundred and eighty-one, awards were made
                            in favor of the claimants respectively against the United States, such
                            awards aggregating $1,929,819.</p>
                        <p>The entire amount of the awards against the United States, including
                            interest, allowed by the commission was, therefore, as will be seen, a
                            trifle over two per cent, of the entire claims presented to the
                            commission, on behalf of British subjects, against the United States,
                            including interest.</p>
                        <p>Of the claims of citizens of the United States against Great Britain,
                            twelve grew out of the Saint Albans raid, so called, and were for acts
                            of plunder alleged to have been committed by confederate soldiers in the
                            town of Saint Albans, Vt., in October, 1864; one was for a like raid of
                            confederate soldiers alleged to have been committed upon Lake Erie in
                            September, 1864, and for injuries to the American steamers Philo Parsons
                            and Island Queen, and the property of American citizens on board said
                            steamers; four were for damages by reason of the alleged <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="pg_9" facs="0065"/>detention of vessels laden with saltpetre
                            at Calcutta, in January and February, 1862, under ordinances of the
                            governor-general of India prohibiting the exportation of saltpetre; one
                            was for alleged injuries to the property of the claimant on the island
                            of San Juan, in Washington Territory, U. S. A., in 1862 and 1864, by the
                            alleged actor procurement of the commander of the British forces on that
                            island, during the joint military occupation of the same by the United
                            States and Great Britain, under a convention between them for that
                            purpose; and one was for a royalty claimed to be due to the claimant
                            from the British government by reason of the adoption and use by that
                            government of a certain invention of the claimant, a citizen of the
                            United States, for the improvement of breech-loading fire-arms.</p>
                        <p>Of the four hundred and seventy-eight British claims presented, two
                            hundred and fifty-nine covered claims for property of British subjects
                            alleged to have been taken by the military, naval, or civil authorities
                            of the United States and appropriated to the use of the Government of
                            those States; one hundred and eighty-one covered claims for property of
                            British subjects, alleged to have been destroyed by the military and
                            naval forces of the United States; seven covered claims for property of
                            British subjects alleged to have been destroyed by the rebel or
                            confederate forces carrying on war against the United States; one
                            hundred covered claims for damages by reason of the alleged unlawful
                            arrest and imprisonment of British subjects by the authorities of the
                            United States; seventy-seven covered claims for damages by reason of the
                            alleged unlawful capture and condemnation or detention of British
                            vessels, their cargoes, &amp;c, as prize of war by the naval forces and
                            civil authorities of the United States; three covered claims for damages
                            by reason of the alleged unlawful warning off of British vessels from
                            the coasts of the States in rebellion by the United States cruisers, in
                            the absence of any lawful blockade of the coasts and ports from which
                            the vessels were so warned; and thirty-four covered claims of
                            miscellaneous character.</p>
                        <p>Many of the memorials singly included claims coming under two or more of
                            the classes above named, a fact which explains the excess of the sum of

                            nature of their respective claims, and the time and place where they
                            arose, the amounts claimed, and the final disposition of the same, will
                            be found in the appendix, C. This schedule is accompanied by
                            alphabetical indexes, giving separately the names of the citizens of the
                            United States claimants against Great Britain, and of the subjects of
                            Her Britannic Majesty claimants against the United States, with
                            reference to the number designating the claim of each person; and also
                            by another alphabetical index referring to the vessels in respect of
                            which damages <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0066"/>were claimed, and

                        <p>The commission continued its sessions in the city of Washington from the
                            day of its first meeting, with adjournments from time to time, down to
                            the 10th day of May, 1873; on which day, under the authority of a
                            supplemental article to the treaty concluded between the two
                            governments, and authorizing the sessions of the commission elsewhere
                            than in the city of Washington, it adjourned to meet at Newport, in the
                            State of Rhode Island, on the third day of June following. On the
                            last-named day it again met at Newport, and continued its sessions
                            without interruption, except by adjournments from day to day, until the
                            25th day of September, 1873. On the last-named day, having finally
                            decided and disposed of every claim pending before it within the time
                            limited by the treaty, the commission made and signed in duplicate its
                            final award, signed by all the commissioners, a copy of which will be
                            found in the appendix, D.</p>
                        <p>Separate awards in duplicate were made and signed by the commissioners,
                            in respect of each claim finally passed upon by them, as the cases were
                            respectively disposed of.</p>
                        <p>The duplicate original final awards, as well as the duplicate original
                            individual awards in the case of each claimant, were delivered by the
                            commission, through its secretary, to the respective governments,
                            together with duplicate journals of the entire proceedings of the
                            commission, kept by the secretary and certified from day to day by the
                            presiding commissioner.</p>
                        <p>The entire number of cases, American and British, decided by the
                            commission (after deducting the eight claims withdrawn by Her Majesty’s
                            agent) was four hundred and eighty-nine. All the commissioners united in
                            the awards in three hundred and seventy-two cases; in ninety-seven cases
                            the awards were signed by Count Corti and Mr. Commissioner Gurney only,
                            Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting; and in twenty cases the awards were
                            signed by Count Corti and Mr. Commissioner Frazer only, Mr. Commissioner
                            Gurney dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the following pages I have attempted, to the best of my ability, to
                            report the various principal questions which arose before the
                            commission, giving a succinct statement of the allegations and proofs of
                            the respective parties upon such questions, the arguments by which the
                            respective claims were supported and opposed, the authorities cited by
                            the respective counsel, and, as far as practicable, the principles
                            established by the respective decisions of the commission. In but a very
                            small proportion of the whole number of cases decided were the grounds
                            of the decision stated in the record or by written opinions of the
                            several commissioners. Wherever the grounds of the decision appear in
                            the record itself, I have carefully given the language of the
                            record.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer has kindly furnished me with copies of a few
                            opinions pronounced by him before the commission, some of them <pb
                                n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0067"/>expressing the views of the
                            commission, or a majority of it, and others dissenting opinions in cages
                            in which his views were overruled by his associates upon the commission.
                            I have deemed these opinions of either class worthy of preservation, and
                            have accordingly inserted them either in the body of my report under the
                            respective cases in which they were delivered, or in the appendix. A
                            very few written opinions are understood to have been delivered by Count
                            Corti and by Mr. Commissioner Gurney, copies of which I regret that I
                            have been unable to obtain for publication with this report.</p>
                        <p>I proceed to consider the various principal questions which arose and
                            were disposed of before the commission in their order.</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">i—jurisdiction as to the person.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Various questions as to the jurisdiction of the commission, in respect
                            both of the persons entitled to a standing as claimants under the treaty
                            and to the subject-matter of the claims, arose and were disposed of in
                            the course of the proceedings. These questions, so far as relates to the
                            jurisdiction of the commission as to the persons entitled to claim under
                            the treaty, may be summed up as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The question early arose in several cases as to the sense in which the
                            respective expressions “citizens of the United States” and “subjects of
                            Her Britannic Majesty” were used in the treaty. This question was raised
                            by demurrer in several of the early cases, and was argued at length in
                            the case of Anthony Barclay <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United
                            States, No. 5.</p>
                        <p>This claim was brought for the alleged taking and destruction of and
                            injuries to real and personal property of the claimant, situated near
                            Savannah, by the army of General Sherman, in December, 1864. The
                            memorial alleged the claimant to have been a native-born subject of Her
                            Britannic Majesty, but to have been domiciled for many years prior to
                            the year 1858 within the United States, a portion of that time as Her
                            Majesty’s consul in the city of New York, and from that time forward to
                            the end of the war a resident of Chatham County, Georgia.</p>
                        <p>A demurrer was interposed to the claim on the ground, among others, that
                            “the claimant, having been at the time of the alleged acts domiciled and
                            engaged in trade and business within the enemy’s country, cannot claim
                            the position of a subject of Her Britannic Majesty within the twelfth
                            article of the treaty.”</p>
                        <p>Under this demurrer, the counsel for the United States contended that,
                            under the twelfth article of the treaty, the terms “citizens of the
                            United States” and “subjects of Her Britannic Majesty” were to be taken
                            not in their strict meaning, under municipal law, of absolute
                            citizenship for all purposes, or of paramount allegiance to a sovereign,
                            but in the larger sense recognized by international law, in which sense
                            it was contended that all persons were included within those respective
                            expressions who by permanent domicile were within the protection of <pb
                                n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0068"/>the government under which they
                            resided, and who thereby owed to the country of their domicile that
                            allegiance, perhaps temporary and qualified, exacted by such domicile.
                            In other words, it was contended that within the terms of the treaty all
                            persons permanently domiciled within the United States were to be taken
                            as citizens of the United States, and all persons permanently domiciled
                            within the jurisdiction of Great Britain were to be taken as subjects of
                            Her Britannic Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States cited in support of this doctrine the
                            following elementary writers: Twiss’ Law of Nations, (war,) 233, 298–9;

                        <p>The commission overruled the demurrer of the United States by the
                            following decision, rendered on the 16th December, 1871, in which all
                            the commissioners concurred: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The first thing to be decided in this case is whether the
                                    commissioners have jurisdiction, which depends upon whether the
                                    claimant is, within the meaning of the treaty, a British
                                    subject.</p>
                                <p>That he is in fact a British subject there is no doubt; but it is
                                    contended that, being domiciled in the United States, he is not
                                    one of those intended by the framers of the treaty to be
                                    included in that term. It is undoubtedly true, as appears from
                                    various cases cited in the argument, that the subject or citizen
                                    of one state domiciled in another acquires, in some respects,
                                    privileges, and incurs liabilities, distinct from those
                                    possessed in right of his original birth or citizenship. But he
                                    still remains the subject or citizen of the state to which he
                                    originally belonged, and we see no reason to suppose that it was
                                    the intention of either government to put the limited meaning on
                                    the words “British subject,” contended for in the arguments in
                                    support of the demurrer so as to exclude from our jurisdiction a
                                    British subject who has never renounced his original allegiance,
                                    or become naturalized in any other country.</p>
                                <p>The fact of the claimant having his domicile in one of the
                                    Confederate States will, of course, have a material bearing on
                                    the point, also raised in the demurrer, as to the <pb n="14"
                                        xml:id="pg_14" facs="0070"/>liability of the claimant’s
                                    property to seizure or destruction by the Federal Army. It is
                                    difficult to lay down a general rule applicable in all cases to
                                    the rights of an invading army, nor, in this particular case, is
                                    that necessary.</p>
                                <p>The statements contained in the memorial are, for the purposes of
                                    this argument, to be assumed to be true. One of the statements
                                    in the memorial is, that part of the claimant’s property was
                                    taken possession of by the Federal Army without any military
                                    necessity, convenience, provocation, or inducement, and
                                    plundered, and that part was wantonly destroyed.</p>
                                <p>Supposing this to be true, we are not prepared to say that some
                                    liability might not be established against the United States
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>The demurrer is, therefore, disallowed; but the United States
                                    Government will be at liberty, if they think fit, to take issue
                                    upon the facts alleged in the memorial.</p>

                            the time of the alleged injuries, and for many years previous, domiciled
                            at Washington.</p>
                        <p>A demurrer was interposed specifying, among other grounds, that the

                            established the doctrine that, so far as relates to the question of
                            jurisdiction, the national character of the party is to be determined by
                            his paramount allegiance, where that is not double, irrespective of the
                            fact of domicile.</p>

                            No. 40, it appeared from the memorial, in addition to the fact of
                            domicile within the insurrectionary States, that the claimant had taken
                            the preliminary steps toward naturalization under the statutes of the
                            United States, by filing his declaration on oath of his intention to
                            become a citizen of the United States, and to renounce all allegiance to
                            Her Britannic Majesty, the sovereign of his nativity.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States on demurrer claimed that such oath,
                            added to the fact of domicile, established the national character of the
                            claimant as a citizen of the United States within international law, and
                            barred him from any standing as a British subject under the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The demurrer was overruled.</p>

                            States, No. 116, the proofs on the part of the defense showed that the
                            claimant, who had filed his declaration of intention, under the
                            naturalization act, before the presentation of his memorial, had
                            subsequently, and pending his claim before the commission, completed his
                            naturalization, and was at the time of the submission of his cause a
                            citizen of the United States. His claim was disallowed on the merits;
                            but the undersigned is advised that the commission was unanimous in the
                            opinion that his naturalization had deprived him of a standing before
                            the commission as a British subject.</p>

                        <p>In the case of John W. Sharpe <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United
                            States, No. 92, the claimant’s proofs showed that he had exercised
                            rights of citizenship of the United States, by voting, prior to the
                            presentation of his memorial.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States contended, first, that such acts
                            constituted an estoppel against the claim of the claimant to a standing
                            as a British subject under the treaty; and, second, that if strictly and
                            technically there was no estoppel, such acts were to be regarded as very
                            strong evidence of the fact of naturalization, and sufficient to
                            overcome the claimant’s own denial on oath of such naturalization.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            dissenting; and the objection on the part of the United States was thus
                            overruled.</p>

                            No. 118, the proofs showed that the claimant had, in 1857, in the State
                            of Mississippi, exercised acts of citizenship of the United States by
                            holding an office, which, under the laws of Mississippi, could only
                            lawfully be held by a citizen of the United States$ and that he had, in
                            1862, the State of Mississippi being then in rebellion against the
                            United States, held a like office, which, by the then laws of
                            Mississippi, could only be held by a citizen of the Confederate
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States contended that the claimant was, by
                            each of these acts, debarred from a standing as a British subject.</p>
                        <p>The claim was disallowed without a separate and distinct decision of this
                            question; but the undersigned is advised that a majority, at least, of
                            the commission were of opinion that such holding of office under the
                            rebel government was of itself a violation of neutrality, and debarred
                            the claimant from a standing before the commission.</p>

                                rend="italic">vs</hi>. The United States, No. 45, the memorial
                            showed the claimants’ testator to have been born in the United States in
                            1819, but alleged him to have been the son of Robert Alexander, a native
                            of Scotland, and a natural-born subject of the British Crown. It also
                            alleged that the testator had always held and claimed himself to be a
                            liege subject of the British Crown, and that he had always been so held
                            and regarded by all others. That in his early youth he had returned to
                            Scotland, and there for many years held office in the commission of the
                            peace and other posts of trust under the British Crown. That during the
                            war his residence was partly in Scotland and partly in Kentucky, he
                            having died in Kentucky in December, 1867. The claim was for the
                            occupation of and injuries to lands and real estate of the testator in
                            Kentucky by United States troops during the war.</p>
                        <p>On demurrer it was contended, on the part of the United States, that the
                            claimants had no standing before the commission in the right of their
                            testator as a British subject; that, although by the law of Great
                            Britain he was a British subject, he was also by the laws of the United
                                <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0072"/>States a citizen of those
                            States; and that, in such a case of double or conflicting allegiance,
                            the claimant was not to be regarded as a subject of Great Britain within
                            the meaning of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States cited the Revised Statutes of Kentucky,
                            vol. 1, p. 238, c. 15, art. 1, sec. 1, as establishing the fact of
                            citizenship under the law of Kentucky; and also Drummond’s case, 2
                            Knapp’s P. C. Rep., 295.</p>
                        <p>The commission held the claimants not entitled to a standing, and
                            dismissed the case, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read a written opinion, as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The testator was by British law a British subject, but he was
                                    also by the law of the United States an American citizen, by
                                    reason of his birth in Kentucky; and he was not capable of
                                    divesting himself of his American nationality by mere volition
                                    and residence from time to time in Scotland and holding office
                                    there.</p>
                                <p>Being, then, a subject of both governments, was he a British
                                    subject within the meaning of the treaty? The practice of
                                    nations in such cases is believed to be by their sovereign to
                                    leave the person who has embarrassed himself by assuming a
                                    double allegiance to the protection which he may find provided
                                    for him by the municipal laws of that other sovereign to whom he
                                    thus also owes allegiance. To treat his grievances against that
                                    other sovereign as subjects of international concern, would be
                                    to claim a jurisdiction paramount to that of the other nation of
                                    which he is also a subject. Complications would inevitably
                                    result, for no government would recognize the right of another
                                    to interfere thus in behalf of one whom it regarded as a subject
                                    of its own. It has certainly not been the practice of the
                                    British government to interfere in such cases; and it is not
                                    easy to believe that either government meant to provide for them
                                    by this treaty. In Drummond’s case the terms of the treaty were
                                    quite as comprehensive as those of this treaty; and yet it was
                                    there held that the claimant was not within the treaty, not
                                    being within its intention. This was held even after it was
                                    ascertained that he was not a French subject, he having merely
                                    evinced his intention to regard himself as a French subject.</p>

                            in effect alleged the claimant to have been born in Pennsylvania of
                            native-born British subjects, never domiciled within the United States,
                            but on a visit there at the time of his birth, and who returned to
                            England within a few weeks thereafter, where the claimant remained
                            during his minority. He was domiciled in the United States at the time
                            of the alleged injuries—the taking and destruction of his property.</p>
                        <p>His claim was dismissed in like manner.</p>

                            States, No. 220, for damages for wrongful imprisonment, and for
                            appropriation and destruction of property, the proofs showed that the
                            claimant was born in the British province of New Brunswick in 1813. His
                            father, Daniel Scott, was born in the then province of Maine, in March,
                            1768, and continued to reside in Maine after the recognition of the
                            independence of the colonies by <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0073"

                            The time of Daniel Scott’s removal to New Brunswick was left somewhat
                            uncertain, ranging from December, 1789, to 1794.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that Daniel Scott, the
                            father, having been a citizen of the United States, the claimant, Joseph
                            W. Scott, was by the naturalization laws of 1802 (2 Stat, at L., 155, §
                            4) also a citizen of the United States, and was debarred from a standing
                            before the commission within the principle held by the commission in the
                            case of Alexander.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the alleged injuries, and for many years previous, he was
                            domiciled in the State of Florida, one of the insurrectionary

                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that Daniel Scott, being a

                            Britain and the United States, was entitled, within a reasonable time
                            after attaining his majority, to elect to which government he would
                            adhere, and that he did make such election within such reasonable time
                            by his removal to New Brunswick.</p>

                            decision proceeded upon the ground that Daniel Scott’a removal to New
                            Brunswick constituted an election, within a reasonable time, to, adhere
                            to his British allegiance.</p>

                            184, and others, it was held that the national character of a married
                            woman is governed by that of her husband in all cases, irrespective of
                            domicile; and that on the death of the husband the national character of
                            the widow acquired by marriage remains unchanged. From this conclusion;
                            Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissented, in the case of a widow of American
                            origin who had always remained domiciled within the United States,
                            holding that in such case, upon the death of her British husband, her
                            original national character reverted.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Mrs. Bowie, No. 320, the claimant was by birth a British
                            subject, but was at the time of the alleged injuries the widow of a
                            citizen of the United States, and domiciled in the insurrectionary State
                            of Virginia, and before the filing of her memorial had again
                            intermarried with a citizen of the United States, who was still living
                            and there domiciled. Her claim was disallowed, all the commissioners
                            agreeing.</p>

                        <p>In the case of Mrs. Calderwood, No. 360, claimant was a native-born
                            citizen of the United States, had intermarried with a British subject
                            who was since deceased, and had always been domiciled in the State of
                            Louisiana. The commission, on demurrer, held her a British subject, Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Mrs. Tooraen, No. 184, claimant was by birth a British
                            subject, her husband at the time of marriage being a subject of Sweden,
                            but naturalized as a citizen of the United States subsequent to the
                            marriage. Claimant and her husband were both domiciled from the time of
                            marriage within the United States., Her claim was unanimously
                            dismissed.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Jane L. Brand, No. 180, which was a claim for alleged
                            wrongful imprisonment and appropriation of the claimant’s property at
                            New Orleans, it appeared that claimant, a native of Ireland, had been
                            for several years domiciled in New Orleans. She there married in 1838 a
                            citizen of the United States, who died in 1849, and she had since
                            remained his widow and continued domiciled in New Orleans. Her memorial
                            alleged that, though married to an American citizen, “she never in any
                            manner adopted his nationality;” that after his death she uniformly
                            claimed the character of a British subject; and that in August, 1862,
                            before the commission of the acts complained of, or a part of them, she
                            had made proof of her character as a British subject before the British
                            consul at New Orleans, and been duly registered as such.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that at the time of the
                            claimant’s marriage and of the death of her husband, and up to the
                            passage of the act of the United States Congress of 10th February, 1855,
                            (10 Stat, at L., 604,) the claimant was not by the laws of the United
                            States a citizen of those States, the act of 1855 being the first to
                            give such status to an alien-born woman by her marriage to a citizen of
                            the United States. That up to the conclusion of the naturalization
                            convention of 13th May, 1870, between the United States and Great
                            Britain, (16 Stat, at L., 775,) and the supplemental convention of 23d
                            February, 1871, between the same nations, (11 <hi rend="italic"
                            >id.</hi>, 841,) no provision existed for the manner in which a British
                            subject who had married a citizen of the United States should, upon
                            becoming a widow, reclaim her original nationality. That the universal
                            custom among nations, founded upon international comity, if not upon
                            international law, allowed such widow to choose whether she would retain
                            the nationality of her deceased husband or return to that of her birth.
                            That Mrs. Brand, by always claiming, after her husband’s death, the
                            condition of a British subject, and by registering herself as such in
                            the consulate at New Orleans in 1862, had done all that was necessary to
                            enable her to re-assume her original national character; and that it was
                            not necessary for her to avail herself of the provisions of the
                            conventions of 1870 and 1871 in order to <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"
                                facs="0075"/>disclaim and repudiate any alleged condition of
                            American citizenship acquired by her marriage.</p>

                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that, under the
                            principles recognized by the commission in the cases of Mrs. Calderwood,
                            No. 360, and others, it was settled that the national character of a
                            married woman was in all cases determined by that of her husband; and
                            that such national character, once acquired by marriage, continued on
                            the death of the husband. That this doctrine had always prevailed in
                            Great Britain, as well as elsewhere, where the domicile of the wife and
                            widow had continued to be that of the husband’s nationality; and that by
                            no treaty stipulation or law, municipal or international, was the widow
                            ever allowed to reclaim her original nationality while still domiciled
                            within the nationality of her husband, until the conventions of 1870 and
                            1871; and that by those conventions she could only reclaim her original
                            nationality in the form provided by the convention of 1871, which in the
                            case of Mrs. Brand had never been done. That she was, therefore, both at
                            the time of the commission of the alleged wrongs and at the time of the
                            presentation of her memorial, a citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously sustained the doctrine maintained on behalf of
                            the United States, and dismissed the claim for want of jurisdiction.</p>

                            others, the question was raised as to the jurisdiction of the commission
                            in the case of the personal representatives of British subjects who had
                            died holding claims within the treaty against the United States, where
                            such personal representatives were citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that under the treaty the
                            claims against the United States of which the commission had
                            jurisdiction must be not only those arising out of acts committed
                            against the person or property of British subjects, but also must be
                            prosecuted before the commission on behalf of British subjects; and that
                            where the claim, though originally one of a British subject, had been
                            transferred by act of the original claimant or by operation of law to
                            citizens of the United States, such citizens could have no standing
                            before the commission.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Mrs. Grayson, No. 291, the claim was prosecuted by her as
                            administratrix of John J. Cowley, a deceased British subject. The
                            claimant was the widow of Cowley, but had, before presenting her claim,
                            intermarried with Grayson, a citizen of the United States. The
                            distributees of Cowley’s estate were the widow and certain brothers and
                            sisters, all British subjects and domiciled within the British
                            dominions. An award was made in favor of the claimant for the one-half
                            of <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0076"/>the claim to which the
                            distributees were entitled, rejecting the one-half belonging to the
                            widow as the claim of an American citizen.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Halley and other cases submitted with it the following
                            decision was entered: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The majority of the commissioners are of opinion that, where the

                                    of an intestate who was exclusively a British subject, and the
                                    beneficiaries are British subjects as well as American citizens,
                                    the claim may be prosecuted for their benefit. The commissioners
                                    are all of opinion that the particular nationality of the
                                    administrator does not affect the question.</p>

                        <p>From the first portion of this decision Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            dissented, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>By the very words of the treaty (Article 12) the claim must be,
                                    first, for an act done to the “person or property of” a British
                                    subject; second, it must be made “on the part of” a British
                                    subject. Distinctly, then, these two things must concur to give
                                    us jurisdiction. This is too plain to admit of controversy. The
                                    treaty is the language of both governments, and must be

                                        >one</hi> only, but of <hi rend="italic">both</hi>. If any
                                    of its terms have one sense in Great Britain and another in the
                                    United States by reason of their respective laws, neither of
                                    these senses can fairly be taken; another, though limited, sense
                                    must be sought, common to both countries. There is such a
                                    restricted sense of the language employed here. In Alexander’s
                                    case I expressed myself on this branch of the present question.
                                    One born in the United States of British parents residing here
                                    would be protected by the United States as fully as any American
                                    against wrongs from other countries, Great Britain probably not
                                    excepted. And Great Britain would not, as against the United
                                    States, intervene in his behalf, though she would claim him as
                                    her subject, and hold him to accountability as such if found
                                    -bearing arms against her. And if born here of British parents
                                    during a temporary sojourn, but afterwards domiciled in England
                                    and never residing here, the United States would practically
                                    treat him as not an American, refusing to intervene in his
                                    behalf against any other government, though she, too, would hold
                                    him to accountability as a citizen if found in arms against her.
                                    And so of persons born in Great Britain of American parents. The
                                    treaty is the product of diplomacy, providing this international
                                    tribunal for the amicable settlement of claims concerning which
                                    each power could lawfully claim redress as it saw fit, not of
                                    claims for which it would have no right to claim redress.</p>
                                <p>Alexander’s case was a little different. He had estates and a
                                    domicile in both countries; was born in the United States of
                                    British parents domiciled here, but claiming only British
                                    nationality. This would be an interpretation of the treaty which
                                    would maintain our jurisdiction in all cases in which the
                                    complaining government would, by international law, have been at
                                    liberty to demand redress. It would settle all such cases, and
                                    thus effectuate the purpose of the treaty which was to terminate
                                    our diplomatic differences. The principles above stated, it
                                    seems to me, apply quite as fully where the person beneficially
                                    interested in the claim made before us is of both nationalities
                                    as where the person originally injured, being also of both
                                    nationalities, is still living and makes claim. To entertain the
                                    claim in either case is to assume that each government has by
                                    the treaty recognized its responsibility to the other for
                                    injuries done to those who are by its laws its own citizens or
                                    subjects This construction, it seems to me, is utterly
                                    inadmissible. I cannot possibly bring myself to believe that
                                    either government intended any such thing.</p>

                        <p>These claims all arose out of the same transaction, and were considered
                            and decided together. All, except No. 14, were claims for property taken
                            and appropriated or destroyed at Saint Albans, Vt., by an incursion of
                            rebels, known as the Saint Albans raid, in October, 1864. No. 14 was a
                            claim brought by the administrator of Elinas J. Morrison, deceased, to
                            recover damages for the wrongful killing of said deceased by the rebels
                            engaged in the same raid.</p>
                        <p>The entire amount claimed in all the cases was $313,490, besides
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>The allegations in all the memorials were substantially the same, and as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>That, shortly before the 19th of October, 1864, a large number of
                            persons, then domiciled or commorant within Her Britannic Majesty’s
                            province of Canada, combined together within those provinces for the
                            purpose of committing acts of depredation, rapine, and war from said
                            provinces as a base of operations, and as a shelter for immediate
                            retreat, against the persons and property of citizens of the United
                            States <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0078"/>residing within those
                            States. That some twenty or more of those persons, shortly before that
                            day, pursuant to the combinations so made, proceeded from Her Majesty’s
                            province of Canada East into the territory of the United States, and
                            assembled at the village of Saint Albans, in the State of Vermont,
                            distant about twelve miles from the border of said province. That, being
                            so assembled, they took forcible and armed possession of a part of said
                            village; there seized and imprisoned several citizens of the United
                            States; fired shots at sundry citizens; by such shooting killed the
                            decedent named in No. 14; set fire to several buildings in the village;
                            entered three of the banks therein, seizing and imprisoning the officers
                            of such banks, and seized and appropriated the securities and moneys
                            from the safes of said banks, together with horses and other property
                            named in the several memorials. That all these acts were committed
                            underarms and with military uniform, equipage, and organization to a
                            greater or less extent. That after the perpetration of these acts the
                            perpetrators retreated in a body toward the province of Canada, and
                            entered that province, carrying with them the plundered property, and
                            closely pursued by the citizens of Saint Albans and vicinity, who
                            organized for that purpose, and would doubtless have captured the
                            fugitive marauders but for the asylum afforded them by Her Majesty’s
                            province. That shortly after the arrival of the retreating marauders
                            within the province of Canada, several of them were arrested by local
                            magistrates in that province, and a part of the plunder carried off by
                            them was seized by such magistrates and retained in their custody. That
                            immediately thereafter requisition was made by the Government of the
                            United States upon Her Britannic Majesty’s government for the surrender
                            of said persons on the charges respectively of murder, assault with
                            intent to commitmurder, and robbery, committed within the jurisdiction
                            of the United States, such requisition being based on and conformable to
                            the terms of Article 10 of the treaty of 9th August, 1842, between the
                            United States and Great Britain. That the requisition was supported by
                            full evidence on the part of the United States of the commission by the
                            persons so charged of the acts of violence above named. That before the
                            hearing before such local magistrates of the charges preferred against
                            such arrested persons, Her Majesty’s government for said province caused
                            the jurisdiction of such local magistrates and the proceedings before
                            them to be superseded by one Charles J. Coursol, a judicial officer of
                            the province, who took jurisdiction of the matters charged, issued
                            warrants for the arrest of the persons so charged, and caused such
                            persons to be removed from the jail at St. John’s, Canada, where they
                            were confined under process issued by the local magistrates, to the city
                            of Montreal; and also caused the property seized to be transferred from
                            the custody of the local magistrates to the custody of Her Majesty’s
                            officers in Montreal. That a partial hearing was had before Judge
                            Coursol, on which hearing full evidence was made of the commission of
                            such acts of violence by the persons so <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23"
                                facs="0079"/>charged; and that the hearing was, on the application
                            of the persons charged, unreasonably, and against the protest of the
                            counsel for the United States, postponed from time to time to the 13th
                            December, 1864, for the purpose of enabling the respondents to make
                            proof of their being commissioned and authorized by the Confederate
                            States of America, so called, to commit the acts of violence named. That
                            on the 13th December Judge Coursol, without hearing any further proofs
                            or arguments, in a hasty, unjudicial, and indecent manner discharged
                            from custody the persons against whom such hearing had chiefly
                            proceeded, and all other persons arrested and held on the same charge,
                            and immediately and with indecent haste ordered the money and property
                            of the claimants found upon the persons so charged to be delivered up to
                            them, and permitted them to make their escape therewith, such money and
                            propperty amounting to.$80,00.0 and upwards, and having been fully
                            proved and identified as the money and property of the claimants, and as
                            having been plundered and carried off by the persons so charged and
                            arrested and discharged. That subsequently further warrants were issued
                            by Judge Smith, one of Her Majesty’s justices of the superior court for
                            the said province, on which warrants, after much delay and hindrance,
                            arising from the friendliness of the constabulary of the province to the
                            confederate raiders and their pretended government, and the
                            unfriendliness of the same to the United States Government and its
                            people, in consequence whereof most of the offenders were allowed to
                            escape, and all the money and property was allowed to be secreted or
                            removed, five of the persons so charged were again arrested and brought
                            before Justice Smith upon an application of the United States for their
                            extradition. That after much delay Justice Smith decided that the
                            persons were not the subject of extradition under the treaty, but were
                            belligerents against the United States in committing the acts complained
                            of, and in making their retreat to Canada and enjoying its asylum, and
                            discharged the prisoners. That by these acts of the judicial officers of
                            Canada, Her Majesty’s government, in effect, refused to surrender the
                            persons who committed these acts of violence within the United States,
                            and refused to restore to the United States and to its citizens the
                            property and money so taken and carried by the plunderers into the
                            province of Canada. That in the commission of these acts, as well as in
                            their organization and preparation for the same, these raiders claimed
                            to act under the authority and in aid of the so-called Confederate
                            States of America—the enemies of the United States—and that their
                            confederation and organization for the purpose of committing these acts
                            were well known to many of the government officials, local officers, and
                            citizens of the province of Canada before the occurrence of the acts
                            named at Saint Albans. That in consequence of the culpable negligence or
                            connivance of the authorities of the province, no steps were taken to
                            prevent the expedition, or to give any information to the United States
                            Government, or any of its officers, so as to enable them to protect
                            themselves <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0080"/>against such acts.
                            That both before and after the acts in question warm sympathy and
                            hospitality were extended to the offenders by a large number of the
                            leading and influential citizen of the province of Canada, and the acts
                            themselves were vindicated and approved by some of the official
                            government newspaper organs in the province; and that such sentiments
                            prevailed there that magistrates and peace officers in many instances
                            refused search-warrants and the necessary assistance to enforce the
                            same; in consequence of which many of the offenders were allowed to
                            escape without arrest and carry with them the plundered property. The
                            memorials charged Her Majesty’s government and official authorities in
                            Canada to have been culpably negligent in permitting the raid in
                            question from their borders, and in permitting the returning band, under
                            fresh pursuit, to escape into Canada and obtain asylum therein, and in
                            refusing to surrender them, with their booty, to the United States, and
                            in neglecting and refusing, upon full notice and demand, to restore to
                            the United States or to the claimants the money and property of the
                            claimants so carried off by the raiders.</p>
                        <p>Proofs taken on the part of the claimants fully established the facts of
                            the depredations committed at Saint Albans, as alleged in the several
                            memorials, and that those depredations were committed by a body of men
                            who came separately or in small detachments from Canada in the guise of
                            ordinary travellers and without any open or apparent organization or
                            military array. That their first apparent action in an organized body or
                            in unison commenced at Saint Albans, on the 19th October, 1864, and
                            continued less than an hour. That immediately after the committing of
                            the depredations charged in the complaint they retreated in a body
                            toward Canada; were closely pursued by the citizens of Saint Albans and
                            vicinity, who rallied for that purpose; and that the pursuit was only
                            abandoned upon the retreating party entering the province of Canada. The
                            party acted under the command of one Bennett H. Young, a lieutenant in
                            the army of the Confederate States, and all its members were claimed to
                            have been connected with the regular military service of the
                            confederates.</p>
                        <p>The arrest, examination, detention, discharge, re-arrest, and final
                            discharge of some of the party, substantially as alleged in the
                            memorial’ were also established by proofs on the part of the claimants.
                            Testimony was taken on both sides bearing upon the question of the
                            knowledge by the authorities of Canada of the intentions of the
                            confederates to organize a raid from Canada upon Saint Albans or other
                            frontier towns of the United States, and as to the conduct of those
                            authorities in regard to taking any measures to prevent or suppress such
                            intended raid.</p>
                        <p>Among the witnesses examined on the part of the claimants to show such
                            knowledge by the Canadian authorities, and their failure to take proper
                            steps to prevent or suppress the raid, were Guillaume Lamothe chief of
                            police of the city of Montreal at the time of the raid, and Jacob
                            Rynders, a detective in the employ of the United States at Montreal at
                                <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0081"/>the same time. The evidence
                            of these and other witnesses tended to establish the fact that the raid
                            upon Saint Albans was arranged and organized in Canada; that the fact
                            that that raid or similar raids were in contemplation was known to high
                            officers of the Canadian government, among others to Sir George E.
                            Cartier and Sir Etienne Taché, then members of the Canadian ministry; to
                            Col. William Ermatinger, a stipendiary magistrate, having the entire
                            control of the police force and militia for the district of Montreal,
                            embracing all the frontier towns in Lower Canada bordering upon the
                            United States; to Lamothe himself, chief of police for the city of
                            Montreal; and to Judge Coursol, government superintendent of police for
                            the city and district of Montreal.</p>
                        <p>The claimants also put in evidence the report of Frederick William
                            Torrance, esq., who was commissioned in January, 1865, by the Canadian
                            government to investigate and report upon the proceedings connected with
                            the arrest, examination, commitment, and discharge of the raiders, the
                            seizure of the moneys found upon them, and the circumstances connected
                            with the giving up of such moneys; also, whether there was any refusal
                            to execute any warrant for the re-arrest of the accused; if so, by whom
                            and for what reason; and generally to obtain authentic information of
                            all matters and things connected with such arrest, discharge, and
                            re-arrest of the prisoners, and the seizure, detention, and giving up of
                            the moneys. In this report, made to the Canadian government and dated
                            18th May, 1865, Mr. Torrance went fully over the whole ground committed
                            to his investigation, Messrs. Coursol and Lamothe appearing before him
                            and being permitted to cross-examine witnesses. The report recited the
                            facts found by him, including the transactions at Saint Albans
                            substantially as alleged in the memorials; the flight of the raiders
                            into Canada, closely pursued by the citizens of Vermont; the arrest in
                            Canada of several of the raiders by the local authorities in the
                            district bordering upon Vermont; the seizure upon the persons of those
                            arrested and in deposits where secreted by them of about $87,000
                            plundered from the banks; the subsequent taking of jurisdiction of the
                            cases of the persons arrested by Judge Coursol, and the transfer of
                            those persons to Montreal; the examination of the prisoners, or some of
                            them, before Judge Coursol, the government of Canada, the United States,
                            and the prisoners all being represented upon such examination, and the
                            same having been continued from the 7th November to the 13th December,
                            including an adjournment of several weeks during that time to enable the
                            defendants to make proof of their relations to the government of the
                            Confederate States, and to show that their acts were those of lawful
                            belligerents and not of private robbers. That on the 13th December an
                            objection was raised by the counsel for the prisoners to the
                            jurisdiction of Judge Coursol, which objection had some days previously
                            been made the subject of a private interview between Judge Coursol and
                            the counsel for the prisoners; and that thereupon the prisoners were
                            immediately discharged, and the money found upon them, <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0082"/>to the amount of about $87,000, was
                            surrendered to them by the chief of police, under the private advice of
                            Judge Coursol, though without any judicial order to that effect. The
                            report of Mr. Torrance acquitted both Judge Coursol and Mr. Lamothe of
                            the imputation of being influenced by corrupt motives. It showed that
                            after the discharge of the prisoners by Judge Coursol, new complaints
                            were made on behalf of the claimants or their Government before Mr.
                            Justice Smith, on which warrants issued for the re-arrest, and that the
                            execution of these warrants was refused by Mr. Lamothe and one of his
                            deputies. Under the instructions of Sir George E. Cartier, and under the
                            stimulus of a reward offered by the government of Canada for the
                            re-arrest of the prisoners, five of them were shortly afterwards
                            rearrested upon the warrants issued by Justice Smith, and on examination
                            were discharged by him, on the ground that their acts at Saint Albans
                            were belligerent acts and not crimes subjecting them to extradition
                            under the treaty between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Torrance stated his conclusions upon the whole case to the following
                            effect:</p>
                        <p>That Mr. Lamothe, as chief of police, committed an improper act in the
                            surrender of the money to the prisoners without official directions from
                            Judge Coursol, as whose agent he held the money, so to deliver it. That
                            the oral and unofficial instruction of Judge Coursol to Mr. Lamothe to
                            the effect that the prisoners, if liberated, would be entitled to the
                            possession of the money, was not a sufficient justification to Lamothe
                            for its delivery, but was an improper instruction on the part of Judge
                            Coursol, and might have misled Lamothe.</p>
                        <p>That Judge Coursol, if his decision that he had no jurisdiction of the
                            case was a correct one, was in fault for having omitted to communicate
                            with the Government before announcing such decision and discharging the
                            prisoners, and had laid himself open to the imputation of a grave
                            dereliction of duty in a matter of national importance. And, on the
                            other hand, if his decision that he had no jurisdiction was erroneous,
                            he was liable to a criminal prosecution by indictment for malfeasance in
                            his office by reason of the discharge of the prisoners.</p>
                        <p>And, finally, that the government of Canada was responsible to the
                            Government of the United States for the acts of Judge Coursol and Mr.
                            Lamothe, and was under obligation to restore the booty brought into the
                            province by the belligerents.</p>
                        <p>Under this report the government of Canada subsequently refunded to the
                            claimants, to whom the same belonged, the sum of about $58,000, the gold
                            value of the $87,000 seized from the arrested raiders and subsequently
                            returned to them. This payment did not include anything on account of
                            the still larger sums plundered and carried off by the raiders, and
                            which never came to the hands of the Canadian authorities.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the defence various prominent officials of Canada were
                            examined, among them Viscount Monck, governor-general of Canada <pb
                                n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0083"/>at the time of the raid; Sir John
                            A. McDonald, K. C. B., and Sir George E. Cartier, Bart., members of the
                            Canadian ministry at the same time, whose evidence tended to show the
                            absence of any such knowledge or information on their part, in regard to
                            any intended invasion of the United States from Canada, as to call upon
                            them for any precautionary acts beyond those actually taken by the
                            government, and to sustain the claim on the part of Her Majesty’s
                            government, that the provincial government of Canada were chargeable
                            with no lack of due diligence in failing to prevent the perpetration of
                            the wrongs alleged by raiders proceeding from Canada in the manner above
                            detailed.</p>
                        <p>In argument it was maintained on the part of the claimants that the
                            evidence showed the raid to have been plotted and organized in Canada,
                            under the advice and direction of Messrs. C. C. Clay, jr., and Jacob
                            Thompson, confederate agents commorant in Canada. That the sympathies of
                            the Canadian people and the subordinate officials of the government were
                            largely favorable to the confederate cause and hostile to the Government
                            of the United States. That there was no neutrality law in force in
                            Canada at the time of the raid. That in the absence of such neutrality
                            law and by reason of the sympathies of the Canadian people and officials
                            with the confederates, the confederates were enabled to use Canada as a
                            base of operations—the scene of their plans and arrangements for warlike
                            acts against the United States, as their point of departure upon those
                            raids, and their asylum on their return from them. That supposing it
                            conceded that Lord Monck and all his ministry were without fault on
                            their part personally, the officers immediately charged with the
                            maintaining of neutrality upon the frontier—Coursol, Ermatinger, and
                            Lamothe—were shown to have been fully advised of the contemplated
                            invasions, and to have failed of their duty in reporting their knowledge
                            to the government, if they did fail so to report it, and in taking
                            measures to prevent such invasions.</p>
                        <p>That the positions of Judge Coursol, as superintendent of police for the
                            city and district of Montreal, and of Colonel Ermatinger, the magistrate
                            charged with the entire control of the police force and the militia for
                            the same district, were such as to make notice to them, in fact notice
                            to the government, and that their failure in any respect to perform
                            their official duty was the failure of the government, and charged Great
                            Britain with the consequences of such neglect.</p>
                        <p>That the government of Canada was under obligation to constantly watch
                            the movements of these enemies of the United States thus plotting the
                            invasion of a friendly nation from the Canadian soil; should have
                            arrested the persons engaged in such plots, or should have expelled them
                            from Canada; and, if the law was found insufficient, should have called
                            on Parliament to make it sufficient. That it was the duty of the
                            Canadian Parliament to have provided by law the means of preventing such
                            invasions; and that the absence of such municipal law could not <pb
                                n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0084"/>be pleaded in bar of the
                            international liability of the government to perform its duty in
                            preserving neutrality towards the United States, a friendly nation. That
                            in fact the government of Canada actually did nothing to prevent these
                            violations of neutrality from their soil, though with abundant reason,
                            irrespective of proof of actual notice or knowledge, to apprehend such
                            invasions by the confederates commorant in Canada; and that the actual
                            notice of such intentions, brought home to Coursol, Ermatinger, and
                            Lamothe, was a notice to the government itself, which was chargeable
                            with the non-feasance or malfeasance of those officers. That the
                            government of Canada was held to “due diligence” to prevent military
                            operations by the enemies of the United States from the soil of Canada,
                            as a base of operations, against the United States. That the measure of
                            this diligence was to be determined by the nature of the danger to be
                            apprehended from the neutral soil, the magnitude of the danger and the
                            results of negligence, the means of the United States to resist or
                            prevent it, the sympathy and aid which the enemies of the United States
                            might receive in Canada, and the unfriendliness of the people of Canada
                            to the United States, the fact of plans for former raids known to the
                            government of Canada, and the hostile speeches and avowed intentions of
                            the enemies of the United States, found in large numbers in that
                            province. That all these considerations combined to require strict
                            diligence on the part of the Canadian government to prevent hostile
                            incursions into the United States across the long and unprotected
                            frontier between those States and Canada.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimants insisted that the Canadian government had
                            entirely failed in the performance of these international duties, and
                            that by reason of such failure Great Britain was liable to the
                            United-States for the injuries inflicted by the raiders. That the United
                            States had done all in their power, and all which they were required by
                            international law to do, to protect themselves against such dangers from
                            Canada; and that the Government of those States had in their diplomatic
                            correspondence preferred such claims against the government of Her
                            Britannic Majesty, and had fully provided by the treaty for the
                            submission of them to the decision of the commission.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimants cited the opinion of Count Sclopis upon the
                            question of due diligence in the tribunal at Geneva; also, on the same
                            subject, 1 Phill., 21, 230 to 232; 3 id., 201 to 237; Halleck, 318, 524.
                            They also cited various passages from the diplomatic correspondence
                            between the governments of the United States and Great Britain during
                            the war, and from the papers before the Geneva tribunal, as well as from
                            the protocols to the treaty of 8th of May, 1871, to show that the
                            Government of the United States had always claimed the British
                            government responsible for the injuries to their citizens by the St.
                            Albans raid, and that these injuries occupied a prominent place among
                            the claims of citizens of the United States against Great Britain <pb
                                n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0085"/>for acts committed daring the
                            war, for the purpose of passing upon which this commission was
                            instituted.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the defence it was maintained by Her Majesty’s counsel
                            that the proofs in the case showed no state of facts importing any lack
                            of care or diligence on the part of the authorities of Canada in the
                            maintenance of their international obligations. That the persons who
                            committed the acts complained of at Saint Albans did not enter the
                            States from Canada in a body, nor with any military array or equipment;
                            that they passed over the lines from Canada individually or in small
                            parties, with the appearance and in the manner of ordinary travellers;
                            that the authorities of Canada had no reason to suppose them engaged in
                            a hostile expedition against the United States, and that no grounds
                            existed for their arrest or detention by those authorities.; that there
                            was nothing in their appearance or movements to excite suspicion; that
                            the Government of the United States had, in 1862, voluntarily annulled
                            its own passport regulations which had previous to that time required
                            all persons coming from Canada into the United States to be provided
                            with passports countersigned by the United States consul-general at
                            Montreal; and that from that time until after the Saint Albans raid
                            there was no regulation interfering with the free and ordinary passage
                            of travellers across the line. That the degree of diligence contended
                            for by the counsel for the claimants would have required of the Canadian
                            authorities a careful examination of every person travelling from Canada
                            to the States as to his character and objects, and would, in effect,
                            have abolished the free intercourse between the provinces and the States
                            which had existed under the full assent and approval of both
                            governments. That from the diplomatic correspondence between the two
                            governments it appeared that the United States had never preferred a
                            claim of pecuniary liability against Great Britain on account of this
                            raid; but, on the contrary, the American Secretary of State, Mr. Seward,
                            had on different occasions expressed his satisfaction with the action of
                            the Canadian authorities, and had particularly expressed through the
                            British legation his thanks to Lord Monck, the governor-general, for the
                            assistance rendered by the Canadian authorities toward the detection and
                            arrest of the offenders. That in the protocols to the treaty, in the
                            four preliminary notes between Mr. Secretary Fish and Sir Edward
                            Thornton, on the subject of the formation of the Joint High Commission
                            which framed the treaty, and by the confidential memorandum or brief
                            sent by Secretary Fish to General Schenck of that commission for the
                            information and guidance of himself and colleagues, there was no
                            allusion to the Saint Albans raid, much less to any claims on the part
                            of the United States growing out of the acts committed or omitted by the
                            British government in relation thereto. That the only explanation that
                            could be given of this omission was that the Government of the United
                            States did not consider itself entitled to make any international
                            demands in the premises. That in fact the <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30"
                                facs="0086"/>proofs failed to show that the raid was organized in
                            Canada; that the raiders procured arms or ammunition there, or did any
                            other act within Her Majesty’s dominions in violation of her just
                            neutrality, which was known to, or with due diligence might have been
                            known to, the Canadian authorities. That, on the contrary, the evidence
                            strongly tended to show that the raid was in fact organized within the
                            United States, and that no act compromising British neutrality was
                            committed by the raiders. That no liability was shown by the evidence,
                            and none was claimed by the claimants’ counsel to exist against Great
                            Britain by reason of the omission alleged in the memorials of the
                            Canadian authorities to surrender the raiders under the extradition
                            treaty. That the acts of the raiders were belligerent acts, and as such
                            afforded no ground for extradition.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s counsel cited the opinion of Count Sclopis in the tribunal
                            at Geneva; also, 1 Phillimore, 230 to 232.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read an opinion, in which I am advised that the
                            majority of the commission concurred, as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I may not be prepared to say that Great Britain used that
                                    diligence to prevent hostile expeditions from Canada against the
                                    United States which should be exercised by a neutral and
                                    friendly neighbor; but in the view which I take of these claims
                                    this question is not important, and need not, therefore, be
                                    decided.</p>
                                <p>The raid, upon Saint Albans was by a small body of men, who
                                    entered that place from Canada without anything to indicate a
                                    hostile purpose. They came not in an organized form, so as to
                                    attract attention, but apparently as peaceable individuals
                                    travelling by railroad and not in company, and stopped at the
                                    village hotels. That there was a preconcerted hostile purpose is
                                    unquestionable, but this was so quietly formed, as it could
                                    easily be, that even at this day the evidence does not disclose
                                    the place, the time, nor the manner. The Government of the
                                    United States was at the time diligent, by means of its
                                    detectives, to know what mischievous expedition might be
                                    organized by rebels in Canada, but it failed to discover this
                                    one until after it had done its work. Such was the secrecy with
                                    which this particular affair was planned, that I cannot say it
                                    escaped the knowledge of Her Majesty’s officers in Canada
                                    because of any want of diligence on their part which may
                                    possibly have existed. I think rather it was because no care
                                    which one nation may reasonably require of another in such cases
                                    would have been sufficient to discover it. At least the evidence
                                    does not satisfy me otherwise.</p>

                        <p>This case was, in general character, and in most of the circumstances
                            accompanying it, analogous to the cases growing out of the Saint Albans
                            raid above reported. The evidence on each side in the Saint Albans raid
                            cases was invoked into this case; and the case was argued, submitted,
                            and decided in connection with those cases.</p>
                        <p>The memorial alleged that some months prior to September, 1864,
                            confederate refugees, domiciled or commorant in the provinces of Canada,
                            there planned and organized a warlike enterprise of forcibly
                            appropriating <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0087"/>steamers of the
                            United States on Lake Erie, and using them for the capture of the United
                            States war-steamer Michigan, then stationed on Lake Erie. That by such
                            capture, the plan contemplated the release of some 3,000 confederate
                            prisoners confined on Johnson’s Island, in Lake Erie, near the American
                            shore; and also to obtain control of the lakes and power to destroy and
                            pillage the cities of the United States bordering thereon. That the
                            existence of the plan for such expedition was known to the Canadian
                            authorities for many months before September, 1864, and that such
                            knowledge was communicated by the governor-general of Canada, in
                            November, 1863, to Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, who
                            communicated it to the War Department of the United States, but that no
                            steps were taken by Her Majesty’s government for said provinces to
                            prevent the execution of the plan.</p>
                        <p>That on the 19th of September, 1864, about thirty confederate soldiers
                            came on board the steamer Philo Parsons, a private freight and passenger
                            vessel of the United States, at certain Canadian ports, with concealed
                            weapons shipped as freight, the vessel being then on her regular trip
                            from Canadian ports to Sandusky, Ohio. That immediately after the vessel
                            had crossed the boundary-line between the Canadian provinces and the
                            States, this party rose with arms upon the crew, took forcible and armed
                            possession of the vessel, making prisoners the officers and crew, threw
                            overboard and destroyed a large quantity of the cargo, seized the money
                            of the claimant, an officer and part owner of the vessel, shaped the
                            course of the vessel for the war-steamer Michi gan, and on their way
                            overhauled, seized, and sunk in American waters another private steamer
                            of the United States, the Island Queen, but, failing to receive expected
                            signals, abandoned their project of capturing the Michigan, raised the
                            confederate flag upon the Philo Parsons, changed her course, and
                            proceeded toward Sandwich, in Canada. That on arriving at Sandwich on
                            the 20th of September, they plundered the Philo Parsons while lying in
                            British waters, landed their booty in the province of Canada, sunk or
                            partially sunk the steamer, and retreated in a body within the province
                            of Canada with the plundered property taken from the vessel.</p>
                        <p>The memorial contained allegations similar to those contained in the
                            memorials in the Saint Albans cases as to the asylum afforded by Canada
                            to the retreating raiders; as to the negligence of the Canadian
                            authorities in failing to prevent the expedition, and also in failing to
                            take proper steps in apprehending the raiders and surrendering them
                            under the extradition treaty, and in restoring the property captured and
                            carried off by them.</p>
                        <p>The claimant claimed himself the assignee of all the other owners and
                            claimed damages in the premises, $16,093.</p>
                        <p>The evidence in the case sustained the allegations in the memorial as to
                            the circumstances of the capture and destruction of the vessels <pb
                                n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0088"/>named, and the seizure of the
                            property alleged, and as to the assignment of the claims of other owners
                            to the claimant.</p>
                        <p>Upon the question of due diligence by the Canadian authorities, the claim
                            was rested on both sides substantially on the evidence taken in the
                            Saint Albans cases, and the arguments of the respective counsel upon
                            this question were substantially those urged in the Saint Albans cases,
                            with the additional point, urged on behalf of the defence, that the
                            Canadian government had promptly given notice to the Government of the
                            United States of the information received by them as to the contemplated
                            raid, thereby putting the United States Government fully upon, its
                            guard.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                            arguments.</p>
                        <p>The claimants in No. 11 were the owners of the American ship Daring;
                            those in No. 12, of the American ship Templar; those in No. 16, of the
                            American bark Patmos, and those in No. 18, of a portion of the cargo of

                        <p>The three vessels above named were, on the 27th December, 1861, in the
                            port of Calcutta, in British India. The Daring had at that date taken on
                            board a quantity of saltpetre, as part of her cargo, obtained a
                            clearance therefor, and had paid the export duty thereon. After that
                            date she completed the taking in of the remainder of her cargo,
                            consisting of linseed, jute, &amp;c., but including no saltpetre, and
                            was completely laden on the 3d January, 1862.</p>
                        <p>The Templar had her cargo all on board, including a quantity of
                            saltpetre, on the 27th December.</p>
                        <p>The Patmos also was fully laden, including 2,000 bags of saltpetre, on
                            the 27th December.</p>
                        <p>On the 30th November, 1861, the following proclamation was issued by Her

                                    in council, to take immediate measures for preventing the

                                    bound for the ports in the United Kingdom, and to cause any
                                    saltpetre which, previously to the receipt, and contrary to the
                                    conditions of the said instructions, may have been placed on

                        <p>The proclamation and ordinances in question were promulgated by occasion,
                            and in view of the arrest on the high seas of the British mail-steamer
                            Trent, and the taking from that vessel of Messrs. Mason and Slidell,
                            agents and emissaries of the confederate government, by a vessel of war
                            of the United States, and in the apprehension of probable hostilities
                            between the United States and Great Britian on account of such arrest
                            and seizure.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that, irrespective of
                            treaty stipulations between the United States and Great Britain, the
                            proclamation and ordinances were in effect an embargo on saltpetre-laden
                            vessels bound for non-British ports, at least during the time it would
                            take to unlade the saltpetre; that it was a civil, as distinguished from
                            a hostile, embargo, not directed against vessels of the United States
                            exclusively, but as a husbanding of resources merely, though in
                            anticipation of probable hostilities, and thereby having some features
                            of a hostile embargo; that even in the case of a hostile embargo, if war
                            does not ensue, innocent sufferers have a just claim for indemnity,
                            recognized by international law and practice; that <hi rend="italic">a
                                fortiori</hi> there is always a just claim for indemnity by
                            sufferers in the case of a civil embargo; that the fact that the embargo
                            was justified by the municipal law of Great Britain did not relieve that
                            government from liability under international law; that the action of
                            the American commander in the arrest of the Trent, and the seizure and
                            removal of the two passengers named, were not justified by his
                            instructions, and were subsequently disavowed by his government, and
                            therefore no international wrong was ever committed by the United
                            States; and that, therefore, such action afforded no justification of
                            measures by the British government in anticipation of war, even if the
                            measures in question would have been justified by the emergency, if the
                            acts of the officer had been avowed by his government; that if the royal
                            proclamation and the ordinances were not to be considered as
                            constituting an embargo, but only a matter of domestic and police
                            regulation, they certainly constituted a violation of the rights of
                            friendly foreigners, and involved liability for compensation; and that,
                            in the case of the Daring, the ordinance of the. 27th December having
                            clearly given her the right to sail with the cargo already loaded, this
                            permission, with the subsequent <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0093"
                            />acts done and expense incurred by her owners on the faith thereof, in
                            continuing to lade their cargo on top of the saltpetre, in reliance on
                            the ordinance, constituted a contract, and entitled the vessel to the
                            observance of that contract by the Indian authorities.</p>
                        <p>Under the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, the
                            claimants respectively contended that the right of the vessels in
                            question to sail with the saltpetre on board was guarantied by the terms
                            of the treaty. That “exportation" of saltpetre “from the said
                            territories" was not “entirely prohibited" by the terms of the
                            ordinances, for such exportation was allowed to England. That
                            transportation from India to England was an “exportation from the said
                            territories," and was so recognized by the terms of the proclamation
                            itself, which recited, “it shall not be lawful for any person to <hi
                                rend="italic">export</hi> saltpetre from any part of Her Majesty’s
                            territories in India, except in a British vessel bound either to the
                            port of London or to the port of Liverpool." That the acts in question
                            were plainly not “in time of war between the British government and any
                            state or power whatever." That the language of the treaty providing
                            “that in all that regards this article, the citizens of the United
                            States shall be subject in all respects to the laws and regulations of
                            the British government from time to time established," could not be
                            construed so as to authorize the local authorities to deny rights
                            expressly stipulated for in the treaty, and formed no bar to the right
                            of the claimants to sail with the saltpetre on board their vessels, the
                            same having been lawfully taken on board.</p>

                        <p>Her Majesty’s counsel maintained that both under international law,
                            irrespective of treaty stipulation, and under the treaty stipulations
                            between the United States and Great Britain, the proclamation and
                            ordinances in question were lawful and valid, and involved no liability
                            for compensation to parties injured by their provisions. That they were
                            general regulations, not directed against the ships or cargoes of these
                            claimants in particular, nor subjecting the ships or commerce of the
                            United States to any discrimination or disadvantage not common to all
                            other foreign nations. That even British ships were subjected to the
                            same disadvantage; and the right of exporting saltpetre to the mother
                            country reserved to them was a right which never had belonged to the
                            United States. That commercial adventures of this character were, in the
                            nature of things, subject to any modification of law which might affect
                            the anticipated profits, and perhaps defeat them altogether. That the
                            ordinances did not constitute an embargo in any just sense, whether
                            hostile or civil. That they were municipal regulations of trade, <pb
                                n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0094"/>not forbidden by any principle
                            known to the law of nations. And that, aside from the treaty between the
                            United States and Great Britain, they were clearly authorized by
                            international law. That a just interpretation of the third article of
                            the convention of 1815 must hold it not to prohibit the British
                            government from regulating the exportation of products of the Indies,
                            from time to time, as might be deemed expedient, or in its discretion
                            from temporarily prohibiting the exportation of some or all of such
                            products to any foreign nation whatever. And that of the occasion of
                            such prohibition and its extent, every nation must of necessity be for
                            itself the sole judge.</p>
                        <p>That the treaty permitting the trade between the Indian ports and the
                            United States in articles the exportation of which “shall not be
                            entirely prohibited,” gave no right to those citizens to export
                            saltpetre at the time in question, the exportation of that article being
                            by the terms of the ordinances entirely prohibited. That the word
                            “exportation" referred to foreign commerce, and not to the
                            transportation from the Indies to the home ports of Great Britain. That
                            the reservation of the right of transportation to such home ports was in
                            no respect prejudicial to the commerce of the United States, they having
                            no right to participate in the trade between Indian ports and the ports
                            of Great Britain. That the treaty itself providing for this trade also
                            provided that the citizens of the United States should be subject in all
                            respects to the laws and regulations of the British government, and thus
                            expressly subjected them to the operation of ordinances like those in
                            question authorized by the statute upon which they were based. That the
                            ordinances of 27th December and 3d January were just, caused by an act
                            of an armed vessel of the United States in violation of international
                            law, and affording a reasonable apprehension of hostilities to ensue
                            between Great Britain and the United States. That in such case all means
                            of protection and self-defense, not in themselves at variance with the
                            ordinary principles of justice, and impartially used, were permissible
                            to every government, and that this prerogative having been exercised <hi
                                rend="italic">bona fide</hi> for the safety of the realm on a
                            particular emergency by a prohibition equally affecting native subjects
                            and foreign merchants, the latter have no ground upon principles of
                            international right or justice to require compensation for such an
                            unavoidable diminution of their commercial profits.</p>

                        <p>The claimant in this case alleged, in substance, by his memorial that
                            prior to August, 1862, he was lawfully possessed of a certain limestone
                                <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0095"/>quarry and lime-kiln,
                            together with some 1,500 barrels of lime, tools, furniture, &amp;c., on
                            San Juan Island, in the Territory of Washington, belonging to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>That in his absence from the island in August, 1862, his wife was ejected
                            from the premises by one Roberts, a British subject, who took possession
                            of the real estate and appropriated the personal property. That claimant
                            commenced a suit against Roberts in a justice’s court of the Territory
                            of Washington to recover the possession of the premises, and obtained
                            judgment for restitution of the property, which was followed by a
                            warrant of restitution for its enforcement.</p>
                        <p>That Roberts thereupon appealed to Captain Bazalgett, commander of the
                            British forces on the island. That Bazalgett thereupon applied to Major
                            Bissell, commanding the American forces on the island, and that Major
                            Bissell thereupon arrested the claimant and the justice of the peace who
                            had rendered the judgment against Roberts, put them in the guard-house,
                            and shortly after expelled the claimant from the island.</p>
                        <p>That in April, 1864, the claimant returned to the island, and finding his
                            claim vacant, took possession of the same, providing-anew stock of tools
                            and supplies, and commenced to work the quarry; but after ten days spent
                            in it, was again forcibly removed by command of Captain Bazalgett, put
                            in the guard-house, detained two weeks, and then banished from the
                            island and forbidden ever to return.</p>
                        <p>The memorial alleged the value of the quarry at $50,000, and claimed
                            damages by occasion of the premises $100,000.</p>
                        <p>Evidence was taken on the part of the claimant tending to sustain his
                            allegations as to his possession of the property and removal
                            therefrom.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the acts alleged the title of the island of San Juan was
                            in dispute between the United States and Great Britain, and the island
                            was occupied by a joint military force of the two governments under an
                            arrangement made between them for such joint occupancy, by which the
                            citizens and subjects of each government were made amenable to the
                            authorities of their own government only.</p>
                        <p>Pending the case before this commission, His Majesty the Emperor of
                            Germany, to whom the decision of the question was referred by the treaty
                            of 8th May, 1871, decided the island to be the property of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The proofs filed on the part of the defence showed that the arrest of
                            Tripp and his expulsion from the island were by order of the commander
                            of the United States forces upon the island, and not through any
                            assumption of authority on the part of the commander of the British
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The claimant filed an argument admitting that the arrest and order of
                            banishment on each occasion came from the American commander, but
                            claiming that it was on the complaint of the British commander, who
                            represented his own government and made unfounded charges <pb n="40"
                                xml:id="pg_40" facs="0096"/>against the claimant, which were the
                            cause of his arrest and banishment, and that by reason thereof the
                            British government was liable to his reclamation for damages.</p>
                        <p>The commission, without hearing any argument for the defense, unanimously
                            disallowed the claim.</p>

                        <p>The memorial of the claimant alleged, in effect, that prior to the 1st of
                            July, 1844, the claimant was the inventor of a certain improvement in
                            breech-loading fire-arms, for which letters patent were issued to him by
                            the United States, dated 1st July, 1844.</p>
                        <p>That in the year 1844 the British government, through Her Majesty’s
                            consul at Philadelphia, ordered of the claimant two specimen guns made
                            under the claimant’s invention and patent, which were thereupon procured
                            to be made by the claimant, and furnished through the consul to Her
                            Majesty’s government in 1845, and paid for by that government.</p>
                        <p>The memorial further alleged that “it was understood and agreed that the
                            invention of said mechanical principle” of the claimant “should be paid
                            for by Her Majesty’s government whenever it should be determined upon
                            for adoption in Her Majesty’s service.” That after the receipt of the
                            specimen guns, in 1845, it was determined by Her Majesty’s government,
                            in the same year, that it was not expedient to adopt them for use, but
                            that subsequently, on the 14th March, 1885, Her Majesty’s government
                            made “a full determination of adoption in Her Majesty’s service of
                            breech-loading firearms” known as the Snyder Enfield rifle, containing
                            and embodying the mechanical principle covered by the claimant’s
                            invention and patent; and that after such official “determination of
                            adoption,” in March, 1865, Her Majesty’s government issued to Her
                            Majesty’s army and navy 500,000 muskets of the pattern named and covered
                            by the invention and patent of the claimant.</p>
                        <p>The claimant claimed a royalty of $1 each upon these muskets, amounting
                            to $500,000, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>A demurrer was interposed by Her Majesty’s counsel to the memorial, on
                            the ground that the commission had no jurisdiction of the claim stated
                            in the memorial, and that the memorial alleged no sufficient ground of

                                    being a claim “arising out of acts committed against the persons

                        <p>These claims arose sometimes within the loyal States, sometimes within
                            the Federal lines, in territory reclaimed from the enemy within the

                            them may be named the case of Thomas Ward, No. 1, which was for cotton
                            taken from the claimant at Wilmington, N. C., shortly after the capture
                            of that city by the Federal forces, and appropriated for the use of the

                        <p>The award of the commission, in which all the members joined, was as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    evidence of Thomas Ward and Sarah Ward, the commissioners are of
                                    the opinion that the receipts and vouchers given by acknowledged
                                    officers of the Army <hi rend="italic">at the time</hi>, show
                                    that the cotton was taken from the claimant for the use of the
                                    United States. This we think sufficient, in the absence of all
                                    countervailing proof, to show the taking by the United States.
                                    Nothing appears to indicate that it was taken as enemy’s
                                    property, and the question of the right so to take is,
                                    therefore, not involved. It was taken nine days after the
                                    capture of Wilmington, N. C., by the United States, and the
                                    possession of the place ever after continued in the United
                                    States. We are not, upon the facts before us, prepared to hold
                                    that, at the time of the taking of the cotton, the place was
                                    enemy’s territory. We agree, therefore, that the claimant is
                                    entitled to compensation for the property, the amount being the
                                    average value of cotton usually produced in that neighborhood,
                                    with interest at six per cent, per annum until January 31,
                                    1873.</p>

                        <p>In the case of John Wilkinson, No. 28, the claim was for beef taken from
                            the claimant on Matagorda Island, Texas, by a commissary of the United
                            States in 1863, and for which vouchers in the usual form were given. The
                            claimant was domiciled and his property situated within the
                            insurrectionary State of Texas, and apparently not within the actual
                            military lines of the United States at the time of the taking. The
                            vouchers were all signed by an authorized officer, and recited, “I have
                            taken for military, purposes from John Wilkinson,” the property
                            described, and that the same was necessary for the public service, and
                            would be accounted for in the officer’s monthly returns.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the taking was a
                            capture under the right of war, and that no liability for payment arose
                            against the United States.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, in which all the

                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the claimant?
                            being domiciled in Kentucky, had precisely the same remedy for property

                            the loyal States) that the laws of the United States afforded him the

                            compensation before the proper bureau of the War Department, and that

                        <p>The commission gave an award in favor of the claimant, in which all the

                            Memphis, Tenn., in June, 1862, shortly after the capture of that city by
                            the Federal forces.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            dissenting upon the question of the sufficiency of proofs, but the
                            commissioners all agreeing as to the principle involved.</p>
                        <p>It may be stated generally that the commission were unanimous in the
                            allowance of claims for property coming under this head when taken
                            within the loyal States or within those portions of the insurrectionary
                            States permanently occupied by the Federal forces, except when something
                            in the nature of the property or in the conduct of the claimant took him
                            out of the condition of neutrality. Thus, for instance, in the case of
                            Robert Davidson, No. 66, the claim was for gun-carriages and other
                            artillery apparatus, manufactured by the claimant for the use of the
                            confederate government, and remaining in his possession at the surrender
                            of New Orleans, together with material for use in the same manufacture,
                            which was taken and appropriated by the Federal forces, under the orders
                            of General Banks, some months after the capture of New Orleans. The
                            claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <p>Where, however, the taking of the property by the Federal forces and the
                            domicile of the claimant were within the enemy’s lines, or in those
                            portions of the enemy’s country not reclaimed from the enemy, the
                            majority of the commission, on satisfactory evidence that the property
                            was taken by authority, or actually appropriated to military use, made
                            awards in favor of the claimants, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting, on
                            the ground that one domiciled in the country of the enemy was himself an
                            enemy in law, whether an actual enemy or not; and by well-settled
                            principles of public law his sovereign had no right in such cases to
                            intervene in his behalf against the ordinary treatment of him as an
                            enemy. In the principle thus held by Mr. Commissioner Frazer, I am
                            advised that the presiding commissioner agreed; but in view of the fact
                            that the United States had, by the establishment of the Southern claims
                            commission, made provision for the compensation of its own citizens
                            domiciled within the enemy’s country who remained loyal adherents to the
                            cause and the Government of the United States during the war,” for
                            property taken in like manner, (16 Stat, at L., 524, § 2,) he was of
                            opinion that neutral aliens in like situation should be entitled to the
                            same degree of compensation, and, if British subjects, to a standing
                            before the commission for that end.</p>
                        <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>Upon this question Mr. Commissioner Frazer held that any provision made
                            for the payment of such claims to citizens was not in discharge of an
                            obligation imposed by the public law, but was a matter of favor, and
                            could carry with it no obligation on the part of the Government of the
                            United States to extend like compensation to others not embraced within
                            the class which it had selected.</p>
                        <p>In the case, however, of John Kater, No. 19, claimant was allowed for two
                            horses taken by Sheridan’s army on its raid through the valley of
                            Virginia in August, 1864, all the commissioners joining in this award,
                            General Sheridan’s order of August 16, 1864, directing the seizure of
                            mules, horses, and cattle for the use of the Army, having in effect
                            promised compensation for such property to loyal citizens.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Henry Henderson, No. 41, the claim was for 112 bales of
                            cotton seized by the United States military forces under orders of
                            General Banks, on plantations in the State of Louisiana, outside of the
                            Federal lines, carried to Port Hudson, and there used in the breastworks
                            of the besieging army of General Banks for the reduction of that
                            post.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that this was a taking of
                            enemy’s property within the enemy’s country for strictly military use,
                            justified by the laws of war, and for which the United States were not
                            liable to make compensation, the claimant being permanently domiciled in
                            the enemy’s country, and subject to the same treatment as other enemies.
                            The claim was allowed by the majority of the commission, Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting and placing on the records of the

                            not appearing to have been taken under any regular requisition or order
                            for military use, or by command of any authorized officer.</p>
                        <p>These claims were numerous and of great variety in regard to the
                            circumstances of the alleged taking. It is somewhat difficult to draw
                            the precise line of distinction by which the majority of the commission
                            were guided in their decisions. It may, perhaps, be said generally that
                            the commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made awards in favor
                            of the claimant whenever it appeared by satisfactory evidence that the
                            property so taken was a legitimate subject of military use and was
                            actually applied to military uses, even though such application was not
                            made through the regular and ordinary channels. On the other hand, where
                            the property was in its nature not a proper subject of military use, or,
                            being such, was not applied to military use, or where the taking
                            appeared to be mere acts of unauthorized pillage or marauding, the
                            claims were disallowed.</p>

                        <p>In the case of Thomas Stirling, No. 12, were included as well claims for
                            property destroyed by the United States Army in its marches and
                            encampments in the State of Virginia, as for horses, carriages, cattle,
                            hogs, flour, corn, and bacon alleged to have been taken and carried off
                            by the soldiers. The proofs showed nothing beyond the disappearance of
                            the property in the presence of the United States Army. The decision of
                            the commission, in which all the commissioners joined, was made in the
                            following words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The acts done upon which this claim is based seem to have been
                                    the ordinary results incident to the march of an invading army
                                    in a hostile territory, with possibly some unauthorized acts of
                                    destruction and pillage by the soldiery, with no proof of
                                    appropriation by the United States. Under such circumstances
                                    there is no ground for a valid claim against the United States.
                                    The claim is, therefore, disallowed.</p>

                        <p>In the case of the Misses Hayes, No. 100, milliners, at Jackson, Miss., a
                            claim was made for a stock of millinery goods and like property, alleged
                            to have been taken by soldiers of the United States Army on the first
                            capture of Jackson, in May, 1863. The acts complained of appeared, if
                            committed by United States soldiers, to have been acts of pillage
                            merely, and the claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                            United States forces, though without proof of the intervention of an
                            authorized officer, the property being in the nature of commissary’s and
                            quartermaster’s supplies, applicable to the proper use of the Army, and
                            actually, though perhaps irregularly, appropriated to Army use.</p>
                        <p>In the case of David Jacobs, No. 236, large claims were made for watches,
                            jewelry, silks, and other valuable goods, liquors and tobacco, alleged
                            to have been taken by General Sherman’s army at Columbia, on the capture
                            of that city, as well as for the destruction of other property by the

                            his neglect and refusal to take any steps for the surrender of the

                            facts, and that a part, at least, of the stolen property was then in

                        <p>In the case of James Crutchett, No. 4, claim was made for the use and
                            occupation of a factory building of the claimant in the city of
                            Washington, which was from July, 1861, to the end of the war, occupied
                            by the United States as barracks, quarters, and offices for troops and
                            officers, and also for large resulting damages to the claimant’s
                            business by this occupation of the buildings and removal of the

                        <p>The proofs showed that the premises were taken possession of by the

                            that partial payments of the rent had been made to the claimant, who had
                            been for many years domiciled in the city of Washington.</p>
                        <p>The counsel of the United States filed a demurrer to the memorial,
                            specifying, among other grounds, that the claimant and his property,

                            of eminent domain over the property by the United States; and that for
                            the exercise of such right and the occupation of the property, full
                            compensation could be had by the claimant under the municipal laws and
                            authority of the United States; and that such acts were, therefore, not
                            the subject of international reclamation.</p>
                        <p>On the argument of the demurrer the counsel for the United States
                            contended that the claimant, domiciled within the United States, was
                            subject to all the burdens and liabilities of other inhabitants of those
                            States, and could claim no better position or superior rights in regard
                            to the United States than a native-born or naturalized citizen of those
                            States. That for the occupation of his premises he was entitled, under
                            the Constitution of the United States, to compensation, and that the
                            Court of Claims had full jurisdiction of the case, and could have
                            afforded him full redress.</p>

                            Eleanor W. Turner, No. 34, was a claim for like occupation of a house in

                            permanently held by the United States. Awards were made in favor of the

                            and captured property act of March 12, 1863, (12 Stat, at L., 820.)</p>
                        <p>This act provided in effect for the turning over of property captured or
                            seized as abandoned by the military and naval authorities of the United
                            States to agents, to be appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, for
                            the sale of such property, and the payment of the proceeds into the
                            Treasury; and provided that the owner of such property might, within two
                            years after the suppression of the rebellion, bring suit for the
                            proceeds in the Court of Claims, and, on proof of his ownership and
                            right to the proceeds, and that he had never given aid or comfort to the
                            rebellion, should be entitled to recover the net proceeds. The act was
                            undoubtedly intended to apply particularly to cotton and the other
                            staple products of the Southern States. To such products only it was in
                            practice applied.</p>
                        <p>Many claims were brought before the commission for property, principally
                            cotton, taken under this act. Most of the claims thus brought had been
                            prosecuted in the Court of Claims, some of which were still pending in
                            that court; some were pending on appeal in the <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48"
                                facs="0104"/>Supreme Court; in some the Court of Claims had given
                            judgment in favor of the claimants for the net proceeds, the claimants
                            now claiming here that such amount was less than the full value of their
                            property, to which they claimed themselves entitled; and in some
                            judgment had gone against the claimant in the Court of Claims, and no
                            appeal had been taken. In some cases the claimants were domiciled within
                            the insurrectionary States, and in others within the British dominions.
                            In a few cases no suit had been prosecuted in the Court of Claims. The
                            agent of the United States interposed demurrers in several cases,
                            including all the different classes above named.</p>
                        <p>On the argument it was contended for the United States that the right of
                            capture, by a belligerent, of private enemy’s property on land was
                            permitted by the laws of war; that that right was specially applicable
                            to the case of a great staple like cotton, upon which the enemy
                            principally depended for his military and naval supplies, and for his
                            credit and means to carry on the war; that by the abandoned and captured
                            property act of 12th March, 1863, the United States had in no respect
                            abandoned or waived this right, but that that act constituted merely an
                            act of grace in favor of individuals who might show themselves
                            personally free from complicity with the rebellion; that under that act
                            neutral aliens stood upon the same footing with loyal citizens, and were
                            entitled to the same rights given to such citizens by the act, and
                            subject only to the same disabilities; that the owner of property thus
                            captured within the enemy’s country had no right of reclamation against
                            the United States, except that given by the act, and that that remedy
                            must be pursued in the form given, and before the tribunal specified in
                            the act.</p>

                                    that right under the public law. That act was purely a municipal

                            jurisdiction of the claims upon their merits. Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            read a written opinion upon the questions involved in these cases, a

                        <p>These claims were also numerous, and involved a large variety of
                            questions. They included claims for property injured or destroyed by the
                            bombardment of towns of the enemy, as in the case of Charles Cle-worth,
                            No. 48; and in other ordinary operations of war, such as the passage of
                            armies, the erection of fortifications, as in the case of Trook,
                            administrator, No. 58, &amp;c. Also, claims for property available to
                            the enemy for military purposes, or for the prosecution of the war, and
                            purposely destroyed in the enemy’s country as a means of weakening the
                            enemy, as in the cases of Samuel H. Haddon, No. 107, and John Murphy,
                            No. 326. Also, for property incidentally involved in the destruction of
                            public stores, works, and means of transportation of the <pb n="50"
                                xml:id="pg_50" facs="0106"/>enemy, as in the cases of John K. Byrne,
                            No. 200; Charles Black, No. 128, and A. K. McMillan, No. 250. Also, for
                            timber felled in front of forts and batteries to give clear range for
                            the guns and deprive the enemy of cover, as in the cases of Trook,
                            administrator, No. 58, and of William B. Booth, No. 143. For property
                            alleged to have been wantonly and without provocation or military
                            necessity destroyed or injured in the enemy’s country, as in the cases
                            of Anthony Barclay, No. 5; Godfrey Barclay, No. 162, and in the Columbia
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>In these claims for destruction of property, it may be stated generally
                            that, with very few exceptions, and those mostly insignificant, no
                            awards were made against the United States.</p>
                        <p>The claims for injuries by bombardment, the passage of armies, the
                            cutting of timber to clear away obstructions, the erection of
                            fortifications, &amp;c., in the enemy’s country, were all disallowed by
                            the unanimous voice of the commissioners.</p>
                        <p>The same may be said of the incidental destruction of innocent property
                            involved in the destruction of public stores and works of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>In several cases there were allegations of the wanton destruction of
                            property by United States troops, and in some cases satisfactory proof
                            was made of the fact of such destruction by soldiers without command or
                            authority of their commanding officers, and in defiance of orders.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Anthony Barclay, No. 5, allegations were made of wanton
                            destruction of property, including valuable furniture, china, pictures,
                            and other works of art, books, &amp;c. The proof was conflicting as to
                            whether the injuries alleged were committed by soldiers or not; but if
                            committed by soldiers, it was plainly not only without authority, but in
                            direct violation of the orders of General Sherman. In the award made in
                            favor of Mr. Barclay, I am advised that nothing was included for
                            property alleged to have been destroyed.</p>
                        <p>Several claims were brought for property alleged to have been destroyed
                            by the burning of Columbia, on the allegation that that city was
                            wantonly fired by the army of General Sherman, either under his orders
                            or with his consent and permission. A large amount of testimony was
                            taken upon this subject, including that of General Hampton and other
                            confederate officers on the part of the claimants, and of Generals
                            Sherman, Logan, Howard, Woods, and other Federal officers on the part of
                            the United States. The claims were all disallowed, all the commissioners
                            agreeing.</p>
                        <p>I am advised that the commissioners were unanimous in the conclusion that
                            the conflagration which destroyed Columbia was not to be ascribed to
                            either the intention or default of either the Federal or confederate
                            officers. The commission did not pass on the question whether, in case
                            the city had been burned by the order or permission of the commanding
                                <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0107"/>officer, any liability for
                            resulting losses would have existed against the United States.</p>
                        <p>The claim of Henry E. and Alfred Cox, No. 229, was for a saw-mill and its
                            motive-power, machinery, &amp;c., destroyed by raiding parties from
                            General Sherman’s army, near Meridian, Miss., in February, 1864. The
                            expedition by which the mill was destroyed was sent out by General
                            Sherman for the express purpose of destroying the confederate mills,
                            supplies, railroads, and means of transportation.</p>
                        <p>The proofs showed that the saw-mill in question had been actually
                            employed in the sawing of railroad-ties for the confederate government,
                            and was available for this and similar purposes.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the defense it was claimed that the destruction was a
                            lawful act of war.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <p>The case of William Smythe, No. 333, was a claim for an iron and brass
                            foundry, machine-shop, and machinery, fixtures, supplies, &amp;c., for
                            same, destroyed by General Sherman in Atlanta, after the capture of that
                            city, and before his advance upon Savannah. The establishment had been
                            employed in the manufacture of shot, shell, and other military supplies
                            for the confederate government.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <p>The case of James and Richard Martin, No. 434, was a claim for the value
                            of the British ship York, which, in January, 1862, on a voyage in
                            ballast from Valencia, Spain, to Lewistown, Delaware, was alleged to
                            have been driven ashore on the coast of North Carolina, one of the
                            insurrectionary States, and, while there stranded, to have been
                            destroyed by United States cruisers.</p>
                        <p>The proofs satisfactorily established that the vessel was actually
                            wrecked without intent of her officers, and while on a lawful voyage. An
                            officer of the United States Navy, believing her to have been
                            intentionally beached for the purpose of running in her cargo for the
                            use of the enemy, and that the cargo, with the rigging and furniture of
                            the vessel, was actually available to the rebels, boarded and burned
                            her.</p>
                        <p>The commission made an award for her value in favor of the claimants, in
                            which all joined.</p>
                        <p>The case of James A. Macaulay, No. 260, was a claim for certain cotton,
                            the cargo of the steamship Blanche, which was alleged to have sailed
                            from the port of Lavaca, Tex., in June, 1862, and on her voyage to
                            Havana to have been pursued by the United States war-vessel Montgomery,
                            commanded by Lieutenant Hunter, to have run aground on the coast of the
                            island of Cuba, and, while so aground, to have been boarded by the crew
                            of the Montgomery, set on fire, and, with her cargo, totally
                            destroyed.</p>

                        <p>The case was unanimously disallowed for lack of proof of the material

                        <p>A large number of claims was brought for cotton destroyed by the United
                            States forces at various points in the insurrectionary States. Among
                            these were the cases of Brown &amp; Sharp, No. 33; John Cairns &amp;
                            Co., No. 39, and several others, for cotton destroyed at Camden, S. C.;
                            of George Collie, No. 458; Christopher Atkinson, No. 380, and others, at
                            Columbia, S. C.; of Samuel Hall Haddon, No. 107, in Screven County,
                            Georgia; of Alexander Collie, No. 376, at Oxford, Ga.; of A. R.
                            McDonald, No. 42; John C. Forbes, No. 300, and others, in Arkansas and
                            Louisiana; and various other claims for like alleged destruction at
                            different points.</p>
                        <p>In several of these cases the proof was clear and undisputed that the
                            cotton was destroyed under express orders of the commanding officers,
                            and for the purpose of preventing it from falling into the hands of the
                            enemy, and of weakening the resources of the enemy. In other cases
                            questions of fact were in dispute, as to the fact of destruction by the
                            United States forces; as to such destruction, if committed, being by
                            order or authority of any competent officer; as to the title of the
                            claimants to the cotton alleged to have been destroyed; and as to
                            whether the cotton, when destroyed, was within the enemy’s country.</p>
                        <p>The question as to the right of the United States to destroy cotton of
                            private owners in the enemy’s country was discussed by the counsel of
                            the United States in his arguments filed in the cases of S. H. Haddon
                            No. 107, and of Brown and Sharp, No. 33; and to some extent in several
                            other cases.</p>
                        <p>On the same subject arguments were filed by Her Majesty’s counsel and by
                            counsel for the respective claimants in the cases of S. II. Haddon, No.
                            107; Brown and Sharp, No. 33; David Jacobs, No. 236; Martha M.
                            Calderwood, No. 360; John W. Carmalt, No. 89; Wood &amp; Hey worth, No.
                            103; James Borron, No. 144, and in some other cases.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that a belligerent
                            might lawfully in the enemy’s country destroy any property, public or
                            private, the possession Or control of which might in any degree
                            contribute to sustain the enemy and increase his ability to carry on the
                            war. That the occasion for such destruction and its extent must always
                            be left solely to the discretion of the invading belligerent, who is of
                            necessity the sole judge as to the requirements of his military
                            position, and of the necessity or propriety of the destruction of
                            property, and of the extent to which such destruction shall be carried.
                            That the actual ownership of such property within the enemy’s country by
                            the subjects of a neutral power, whether domiciled within the enemy’s
                            country or not, did not relieve such property from its liability to such
                            destruction. That cotton in the insurrectionary States was peculiarly
                            and eminently a legitimate subject for such destruction, from its
                            relation to the enemy’s <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0109"
                            />government, as the great staple from which were derived the principal
                            means of that government for the carrying oh of the war, which was the
                            principal basis of its credit, the source of its military and naval
                            supplies, and on which it relied to maintain its independent existence
                            and to carry on the war against the United States. That the control of
                            this staple as to production, sale, and exportation, had been, to a
                            large extent, assumed by that government. That by the laws, military
                            orders, and practice of the Confederate States and their authorities,
                            the destruction of cotton, whenever likely to fall into the hands of
                            their enemies, was enjoined and practiced, and that this practice of the
                            confederate government and its officers had received the express and
                            formal approval of the British government as a legitimate practice under
                            the laws of war.</p>
                        <p>Proofs were made in the case of Wood and Hey worth, No. 103, (proofs for
                            defense, pp. 16, 20, 24, 37 to 47, 51 to 65,) of the statutes of the
                            confederate government in regard to their control of this staple, and in
                            regard to its destruction when necessary to prevent its falling into the
                            hands of the enemy; of the practice of the confederate government in
                            controlling its production, sale, and exportation; of the acts of its
                            president and other executive and administrative officers in this
                            regard, and of the military orders and practice under the same for its
                            destruction when exposed to capture by the enemy. Other proofs in regard
                            to this practice of destruction by the confederates were made in the
                            cases of James Gumming, No. 94; A. R. McDonald, No. 42, and various
                            other cases.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States, in his arguments, cited the letter
                            from Earl Russell to Lord Lyons of 31st May, 1862, from the British Blue
                            Book relating to the United States, 1863, vol. 2, p. 33, in which his
                            lordship said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Mr. Seward, in his conversation with your lordship, reported in
                                    your dispatch of the 16th instant, appeared to attribute blame
                                    to the confederates for destroying cotton and tobacco in places
                                    which they evacuate on the approach of the Federal forces. But
                                    it appears to be unreasonable to make this a matter of blame to
                                    them, for they could not be expected to leave such articles in
                                    warehouses to become prize of war, and to be sold for the profit
                                    of the Federal Government, which would apply the proceeds to the
                                    purchase of arms to be used against the South.</p>

                                n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0110"/>that, by the modern law of war
                            and the practice of civilized nations under it, private property of
                            non-combatants on land is exempt from seizure, confiscation, or
                            destruction, and that this principle was fully recognized, in theory at
                            least, by the United States in the exercise of their belligerent rights
                            in the late civil war; that the article of cotton, the property of
                            non-combatants, was no exception to this general principle, this in fact
                            having constituted the great mass of the property the proceeds of which
                            were allowed to be recovered in the Court of Claims; that as to
                            non-combatant citizens the United States recognized the rule of the
                            exemption of their private property from capture and destruction; and
                            that as to neutral aliens, peaceably residing in the United States, upon
                            the faith of treaties of amity and commerce, at least an equally
                            favorable doctrine must be applied; that if, in any case, the capture or
                            destruction of such property became a military necessity, such capture
                            or destruction was accompanied by liability to compensation.</p>

                            award in favor of the claimant, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting. In
                            that case the cotton was alleged to have been purchased by the claimant
                            principally in Ashley County, Arkansas, under permits issued by the
                            proper officers of the United States Treasury, under the statutes
                            regulating trade in the insurrectionary States, and the regulations of
                            the Secretary of the Treasury made pursuant to said statutes, and to
                            have been destroyed in the same region by United States forces under the
                            command of General Osband, in February, 1865. These statutes and
                            regulations only authorized trade in the insurrectionary States within
                            the lines of military occupancy of the United States forces; and it was
                            contended on the part of the claimants that the issuing of such permits
                            by the Treasury officers was controlling evidence that the region
                            covered by the permits, and within which the cotton was alleged to have
                            been purchased and destroyed, was actually within the military lines of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the evidence
                            conclusively showed that at the time of the issuing of the permits in
                                <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0111"/>question, and of the alleged
                            purchases under the same, as well as at the time of the alleged
                            destruction, the region where the cotton was situated was entirely
                            outside the lines of military occupancy of the United States, and within
                            the control, civil and military, of the confederate government; that the
                            permits in question were irregularly and unlawfully issued; that they
                            gave no authority to the claimant to purchase within the district in
                            question; that the cotton was purchased, if at all, within the enemy’s
                            country, and under collusive arrangements between the claimant and the
                            confederate cotton bureau; that the permits, even if valid when issued,
                            afforded no protection to the cotton when actually within the enemy’s
                            lines at the time of its destruction; that the claimant, by his unlawful
                            dealings with the enemy, had forfeited any possible right which he might
                            have had under his alleged permits, and that the claim was, to a large
                            extent, fraudulent, both as to the alleged purchase and destruction.</p>
                        <p>The entire claim of this claimant amounted, including interest, to over
                            $3,000,000. The award was for the sum of $197,190, including interest. I
                            am advised that, in the making of this award, the majority of the
                            commission did not intend to depart from the principle held by them in
                            the other claims for cotton destroyed; but that they regarded the
                            permits as controlling evidence that the region where the cotton was
                            situated was within the lines of Federal occupancy.</p>
                        <p>The case of John Turner, No. 44, included a claim for a dwelling-house of
                            the claimant, situated near the field of Fair Oaks, in Virginia, alleged
                            to have been for several weeks occupied as a hospital by the army of
                            General McClellan, in the spring of 1862. It was alleged by the claimant
                            that large stores of medicines and hospital supplies had accumulated in
                            this house, and that upon the retreat of General Mc-Clellan’s army, it
                            being impossible to save the stores so accumulated, the dwelling-house
                            was burned, with its contents, by the Federal officers, in order to
                            prevent these stores from falling into the hands of the enemy. The
                            proofs substantially sustained these allegations.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant, in which I am advised that
                            the majority of the commission included an allowance in respect of the
                            destruction of the house in question. Mr. Commissioner Frazer joined in
                            the award; but in his computation of amount included nothing for the
                            house. In no other case was any award made for the mere destruction of
                            buildings within the insurrectionary territory not permanently reclaimed
                            to the possession of the United States; and this award was therefore an
                            exceptional one, and not within the principle by which the commission
                            was governed in other cases.</p>
                        <p>The cases of A. R. McDonald, Nos. 42 and 334; of John Turner, No. 44; and
                            of J. &amp; R. Martin, No. 434, were the only cases in which awards were
                            made for the mere destruction of property within the insurrectionary
                            States.</p>

                                been destroyed by the rebels.</hi></p>
                        <p>In the case of John H. Hanna, No. 2, the memorial alleged in effect that
                            the claimant was the owner of 819 bales of cotton, situated within the
                            rebel States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and that “without fault of
                            petitioner, against his consent, and by force and arms, said cotton was
                            destroyed by rebels in arms against the Government of the United States
                            prior to the year 1863.” By the schedules annexed to his memorial and
                            made a part of the same, it appeared that the cotton in question was
                            destroyed by orders of the authorities of the Confederate States and of
                            the rebel State of Louisiana, for the purpose of preventing the same
                            from falling into the hands of the Federal forces.</p>
                        <p>A demurrer to the memorial was interposed on behalf of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>On the argument of the demurrer it was contended by Her Majesty’s
                            counsel, on behalf of the claimant, that the acts of destruction alleged
                            in the memorial appearing to have been deliberately committed under the
                            orders of the commander of the forces of the Confederate States, and
                            with the concurrent authority of the governor of the State of Louisiana
                            and commander of the troops of that State, reclamation must lie on
                            behalf of the British government, in the interest of the claimant as a
                            subject of that government, against the United States as representing
                            and including the State of Louisiana, as well as all the other States
                            forming the so-called Confederate States; that the persons engaged in
                            these acts of destruction were not liable, either civilly or criminally,
                            either for reparation or punishment in respect of those acts, they
                            having been committed in the course of military operations under the
                            authority of the existing government, whether lawful or usurped.</p>
                        <p>That for the wrongful acts of the several States in respect to foreign
                            nations or their subjects, reclamation could be made only against the
                            United States, to the Government of which, by its Constitution, was
                            reserved the power of making treaties, declaring war, and making peace,
                            and all international powers generally, the same being denied to the
                            individual States; that no foreign nation could negotiate with or make
                            demand upon individual States in respect of such acts, but could deal
                            only with the Government of the United States; that in case of wrongs
                            committed by any State upon foreign nations, in regard to which that
                            State, if wholly independent and not a member of the Federal Union,
                            would be liable to reclamation, and to be called to account in the mode
                            practiced between nations—by treaty or by war—these remedies against
                            such State being denied to foreign powers by the Constitution of the
                            United States, the liability for reparation devolved upon the United
                            States, and the Federal Government must be held to answer as well for
                            the acts of the authorities of its several constituent States as for
                            those of the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>That the so-called secession of the State of Louisiana and the other
                            States forming the so-called Confederate States did not extinguish or
                                <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0113"/>suspend the liability of the
                            United States for wrongful acts committed by said States.</p>
                        <p>That by the treaties of 1794, 1815, and 1827, the United States had
                            stipulated with Great Britain for the protection of her subjects in the
                            State of Louisiana, as well as in all other territory of the United
                            States; that the United States not having allowed the claim of Louisiana
                            to be released from her constitutional obligations and restrictions, but
                            having held her to her constitutional obligations, and having insisted
                            that their political relations with foreign powers were in no wise
                            affected by the insurrection in the Southern States, and that the
                            Government of the United States was rightfully supreme in Louisiana and
                            the other States in rebellion, and having finally maintained its
                            authority over those States, its liability to Great Britain for
                            violation of these treaties by those respective States remained
                            precisely as if there had been no insurrection or civil war.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s counsel further contended that, as a principle of
                            international law, if the rightful government of a country be displaced
                            and the usurping government becomes liable for wrongs done, such
                            liability remains, and devolves on the rightful government when
                            restored; that this principle equally applied when the usurpation was
                            only partial; that the restored and loyal government of Louisiana was
                            liable for wrongs done by the insurrectionary government of the same
                            State; and that it was only by the provisions of the Constitution of the
                            United States that the State of Louisiana was prevented from being
                            compelled to discharge that liability toward foreign governments, and
                            that on this ground the Government of the United States must be held
                            responsible for the acts of the State of Louisiana.</p>
                        <p>He cited in support of these propositions the treaties of 1815 and 1827
                            between the United States and Great Britain, (8 Stat, at L., p. 228,

                            20, 1871, (17 id., 13 to 15.)</p>
                        <p>The argument on behalf of the United States was summed up as follows: <list>
                                <item>First. That whatever may be the relations of the separate
                                    States of the Union to the Government of the United States, it
                                    is manifest that no responsibility can attach to the United
                                    States for the destruction of the claimant’s property under
                                    color of the authority of the State of Louisiana, because its
                                    destruction was not authorized by any officials representing or
                                    authorized to represent or act for the State of Louisiana under
                                    the Constitution and laws of the United States. There can be no
                                    legitimate officers of a State to constitute its government,
                                    except such as have taken an oath to support the <pb n="58"
                                        xml:id="pg_58" facs="0114"/>Constitution of the United
                                    States. All others are usurpers and pretenders. But, further, a
                                    State of the Union has no political existence which can he or
                                    has been recognized by Great Britain, except as a part of the
                                    United States, in subordination to the National Government. The
                                    rebels, who, by usurpation, undertook to act for the State of
                                    Louisiana, declared their action to be in behalf of the State,
                                    which they claimed as a component part of another and hostile
                                    nation.</item>
                                <item>Secondly. The destruction of the claimant’s cotton was done
                                    under the order of the commander of a military force engaged in
                                    hostilities against the United States, and whose acts Great
                                    Britain had recognized as those of a lawful belligerent, having
                                    all the rights of war against the United States that any foreign
                                    invader could have had. The men professing to act as the local
                                    authorities, in concurring in the order of destruction acted as
                                    the assistants and allies of the hostile and belligerent power,
                                    and subject to its control. It is as absurd to hold the United
                                    States responsible in the case of Hanna as it would be to hold
                                    France responsible for the destruction of the property of a
                                    British subject in the part of France held by the German armies
                                    in the late war, on the ground that a French official, at the
                                    head of some <hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> or <hi
                                        rend="italic">commune</hi>, might have joined in the order
                                    of the German forces for its being done, he having been put in
                                    office or retained there by the German forces for the very
                                    purpose, and having first renounced his allegiance to France and
                                    taken an oath of allegiance to Germany.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously sustained the demurrer in the following award:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The claim is made for the loss sustained by the destruction of
                                    cotton belonging to the claimant by men who are described by the
                                    claimant as rebels in arms against the Government of the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>The commissioners are of opinion that the United States cannot be
                                    held liable for injuries caused by the acts of rebels over whom
                                    they could exercise no control, and which acts they had no power
                                    to prevent.</p>
                                <p>Upon this ground, and without giving any opinion upon the other

                        <p>This was among the earliest of the decisions of the commission, and it is
                            understood that in consequence of it a large number of claims of similar

                            322, and Valentine O’Brien O’Connor, No. 404, likewise arose out of
                            property destroyed by the rebels; but in each of them it was attempted
                            on the part of the claimants to take the case out of the decision in
                            Hanna’s case.</p>
                        <p>In each of the cases it was alleged that the claimant was the owner of
                            tobacco stored in the State of Virginia at the breaking out of the
                            rebellion; that, early in the year 1881, the ports of Virginia were
                            blockaded under the proclamation of the President of the United States,
                            and before the claimants could remove their property by land, the
                            Congress of the United States, by act of 13th June, 1861, prohibited the
                            transportation of merchandise from Virginia into the loyal States,
                            except under license and permission of the President, and in pursuance
                            of rules to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury; and that <pb

                            &amp; Co. and Irvin &amp; Co. it was alleged that the tobacco remained
                            stored in Richmond until the burning of that city by the rebels on the
                            3d April, 1865. In the case of O’Connor it was further alleged that in
                            April, 1865, claimant sent a vessel from Ireland destined for Richmond,
                            for the purpose of carrying away his tobacco, which vessel arrived at
                            Hampton Roads in June, 1865, but was warned off by a public armed vessel
                            of the United States and compelled to return to Dublin without the
                            tobacco. In this case it was further alleged that a part of the tobacco
                            was destroyed by the conflagration kindled by order of the confederate
                            authorities on the 3d April, 1865; that another portion was destroyed by
                            an accidental fire in March, 1863, but which occurred in consequence of
                            the disturbed condition of affairs then existing in Richmond; that
                            another portion was seized for taxes levied by the confederate
                            government, and another portion used and destroyed by the authorities of
                            the Confederate States for experimental purposes; and it was alleged
                            that all these losses of Mr. O’Connor were solely in consequence of the
                            failure of the United States to maintain and enforce their authority in
                            the State of Virginia, and to suppress the civil and military disorders
                            then existing there.</p>
                        <p>A demurrer was interposed on behalf of the United States in each of the
                            three cases.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s counsel filed an argument in Nos. 321 and 322, in which he
                            contended that the memorials showed a case where, by the acts of the
                            United States, the claimants were prevented from removing their tobacco
                            from the seat of war, where it was exposed to danger; and that but for
                            such prohibition they would have removed and saved it; but that they
                            were compelled to leave it in the hostile country, where it ultimately
                            perished from one of the dangers incident to the war; that the acts of
                            the United States alleged in the memorial, by which the claimants were
                            prevented from removing their tobacco, were not lawful acts under
                            international law.</p>
                        <p>That, by the statute of 13th July, 1861, (12 Stat, at L.,) commercial
                            intercourse between the States in rebellion and the loyal States was
                            prohibited, subject only to the license and permission of the President
                            “in such articles, and for such time and by such persons as he in his
                            discretion may think most conducive to the public interest, and such
                            intercourse, so far as by him licensed, shall be conducted and carried
                            on only in pursuance of rules and regulations prescribed by the
                            Secretary of the Treasury;” that by the regulations issued by the
                            Secretary of the Treasury under this act, a tax was imposed upon such
                            permits, and a special tax upon property to be brought out under them,
                            and it was provided that such permits should only be granted to loyal
                            citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>That this act and the subsequent legislation of the United States did <pb
                                n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0116"/>not provide for blockade or
                            non-intercourse <hi rend="italic">jure belli</hi>, but were acts
                            regulating intercourse by municipal statute between different sections
                            of the territory of the United States; that these statutes worked
                            injustice to the claimants, and deprived them of privileges to which
                            they were entitled by the treaty between the United States and Great
                            Britain; that the loss of the property in question was caused by them,
                            and therefore was a legitimate subject of international reclamation
                            before the commission.</p>
                        <p>That, considering the prohibition in the light of a belligerent act, the
                            United States were bound, in analogy to maritime blockade, to allow a
                            reasonable time for the claimants to bring out their property; and, in
                            further analogy to the law of maritime blockade, that, as a belligerent
                            cannot blockade a port against neutrals while he allows his own or his
                            enemy’s merchant-vessels privilege of ingress and egress for the
                            purposes of trade, the United States cannot rightfully permit their own
                            citizens to trade with the insurgents under permits, while prohibiting
                            trade to neutral aliens and others without permits.</p>
                        <p>He cited the letter of Mr. Cass, Secretary of State, to Mr. Mason, United

                        <p>The commission unanimously, and without hearing argument for the United
                            States, sustained the respective demurrers, and disallowed the
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>In the case of James Stewart, No. 339, it was alleged that the claimant,
                            having purchased certain cotton situated upon the Mississippi River, at
                            Dead Man’s Bend, below Natchez, sent a steamboat to remove the cotton,
                            but that the steamboat was improperly forbidden to land by the captain
                            of a gun-boat then cruising opposite the place where the cotton was
                            stored; that the claimant was thus prevented from removing his cotton,
                            which was soon afterward burned by rebel scouts.</p>
                        <p>Various questions of fact arose in this case as to the title of the
                            claimant; but it was maintained on the part of the United States that,
                            upon the facts alleged, no reclamation could lie against the United
                            States; that the discretion of the commanding officer of the gun-boat as
                            to permitting or not permitting vessels to land, even for the removal of
                            property for which permits from the civil authorities were held, was
                            absolute; and that the alleged act of the officer, in prohibiting the
                            steamboat from approaching the land and removing the property, was
                            within the scope of his authority, and in the exercise of his duty; that
                            the subsequent destruction of the property by the rebels was not a
                            necessary or natural consequence of any wrongful act of the United
                            States or any officer of the United States, and that no liability
                            existed against the United States in respect of the transaction.</p>
                        <p>The claim was disallowed, all the commissioners agreeing.</p>

                                wrongful arrest and imprisonment</hi>.</p>
                        <p>These claims were one hundred in number, and the total amount of damages
                            claimed, in all, was nearly $10,000,000, exclusive of interest; or,
                            adding interest at the rate allowed by the commission, say
                            $16,000,000.</p>
                        <p>In thirty four of the cases awards were made in favor of the claimants
                            against the United States, in all amounting to $167,911. In sixty-four
                            cases these claims were disallowed; one case was dismissed without
                            prejudice for impertinent and scandalous language used in the memorial,
                            and one was withdrawn by Her Majesty’s agent by leave of the
                            commission.</p>
                        <p>The question early arose before the commission whether in case of death
                            prior to the presentation of the claim of the party against whose person
                            the wrongful acts were alleged to have been committed, the claim for
                            such injuries was to be considered as surviving to the personal
                            representatives. This question was raised by demurrer interposed on
                            behalf of the United States, in the cases of Edward McHugh, No. 357;
                            Elizabeth Sherman, No. 359; and Elizabeth Brain, No. 447.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Mrs. Sherman, No. 359, all connection between the injuries
                            alleged and the death of the intestate was disclaimed by the
                            memorial.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of Mrs. Brain, No. 447, and of McHugh, No. 357, there were
                            allegations that the injuries complained of caused or contributed to
                            cause the death of the intestate; but there was no allegation of any
                            local statute allowing damages in favor of personal representatives for
                            a wrongful injury causing death.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that, as by the common
                            law both of Great Britain and of the United States, claims for injuries
                            to the person did not survive to the personal representatives, such
                            claims were not to be considered as within the submission by article 12.
                            That the claims which by that article were submitted could not be taken
                            to comprehend claims of a character not recognized by the municipal laws
                            of either of the countries parties to the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s counsel contended that the municipal laws of the two
                            countries were not to be taken as controlling the rights of claimants in
                            this regard; that claims for injuries to the person, whether such
                            injuries caused death or not, were, in the diplomatic intercourse of
                            civilized nations, treated as a proper subject of international
                            reclamation in behalf of the personal representatives of the person
                            injured after his death. He cited the practice of the commissions under
                            the convention between the United States and New Granada, of 10th
                            September, 1857, (12 Stat, at L., 985,) and under the treaty of
                            Guadalupe Hidalgo, of 2d February, 1848, between the United States and
                            Mexico, (9 Stat, at L., 933, art, 13.)</p>
                        <p>In the case of McHugh, No. 357, where the deceased died unmarried and
                            leaving only collateral relatives not dependent on him for support, <pb
                                n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0118"/>entitled to inherit, the
                            commission unanimously sustained the demurrer and disallowed the
                            claim.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of Mrs. Sherman, No. 359, and Mrs. Brain, No. 447, in both
                            which cases the deceased left a widow and minor children, the
                            commission, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting, overruled the demurrers.
                            Mr. Commissioner Frazer read an opinion for sustaining the demurrers in
                            each of the three cases, which will be found in the appendix, I.</p>
                        <p>It may be added that on final hearing on the merits the claim of Mrs.
                            Sherman was unanimously disallowed; and though an award was made (Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting) in favor of Mrs. Brain on account of
                            property taken from her husband, that award included no damages for
                            imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>The following cases are selected as class cases illustrating the holdings
                            of the commission upon the various questions involved in these
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Ernest W. Pratt, No. 6, it was alleged that the claimant
                            arrived in New York on a British mail-steamer from Nassau, on the night
                            of the 17th March, 1865; that before leaving the vessel he was arrested
                            by order of General Dix, then in command of the United States forces in
                            and around New York, his luggage and papers searched, and he himself
                            committed to prison, where he was detained until the 25th June
                            following, a period of one hundred and seven days, when he was
                            discharged without trial.</p>
                        <p>That he had received at Nassau, from the United States consul there, an
                            endorsement upon his discharge from the steamship City of Richmond, of
                            which he had been first mate, certifying that he was entitled to pass to
                            the United States as a British subject, which certificate had been given
                            to him by the consul with the assurance that it had all the effect of a
                            regular passport.</p>
                        <p>It appeared that in October, 1869, he had been about to commence suit
                            against General Dix to recover damages for his false imprisonment, and
                            his counsel having informed the Secretary of State of the United States
                            of his intention to bring such suit, the Secretary, by letter to his
                            counsel in answer, suggested whether it was not expedient to "await the
                            result of the deliberation of this (the United States) Government and
                            that of Great Britain upon a proposition for the establishment or
                            adjudication, among other things, of claims like that of Mr. Pratt;” and
                            the claimant averred that in conformity with this suggestion he omitted
                            to bring his suit against General Dix.</p>
                        <p>The City of Richmond, of which vessel the claimant had been first mate,
                            had been engaged in January, 1865, in carrying crew, arms, and
                            ammunition from London to the rebel cruiser Stonewall, which received
                            substantially her entire crew and armament of small-arms and ammunition
                            by that means. On parting with the Stonewall, the City of Richmond
                            steamed to Bermuda, and thence to Nassau, where her officers and <pb
                                n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0119"/>men were discharged, the claimant
                            immediately proceeding to New York, as above stated.</p>
                        <p>The claimant alleged in his memorial, however, that he shipped upon the
                            City of Richmond in good faith for an ordinary voyage to the West
                            Indies, and without information or suspicion that “her voyage was in any
                            way connected with either of the belligerent parties in the United
                            States,” and that, on finding her engaged in supplying the Stonewall, he
                            had protested to his captain, who paid no attention to his protest, and
                            required him to obey orders on pain of arrest for mutiny. The fact of
                            the claimant’s having been thus engaged on the City of Richmond was
                            reported to General Dix, and this, in connection with his arrival in New
                            York from Nassau, constituted the grounds of his arrest by General
                            Dix.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the fact of the
                            claimant’s having been actively engaged in aiding the enemies of the
                            United States, and that he immediately thereafter came from Nassau, the
                            principal port in the Atlantic from which intercourse with the States in
                            rebellion was kept up through the blockade, to New York, justified the
                            authorities of the United States in arresting and holding him both as a
                            prisoner of war and as a probable spy.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that there was no proof of
                            any offence committed by the claimant against the laws of the United
                            States, or the laws or principles of neutrality. That even if he had
                            voluntarily participated in the cruise of the City of Richmond to equip
                            the Stonewall, this fact would have furnished no justification for his
                            subsequent arrest in New York, though it might have sufficed to
                            determine Her Majesty’s government not to interfere for his protection
                            or indemnity. That the informality in his passport was caused, if not
                            contrived, by the United States consul at Nassau, and that the assurance
                            by that officer to the claimant that the passport was a sufficient one
                            was in bad faith, and made with a view to the claimant’s arrest when he
                            should arrive in the city of New York, the consul having sent by the
                            same ship a letter addressed to General Dix, giving him the information
                            upon which he acted; and that the claimant’s imprisonment was
                            unnecessarily and unjustly severe and prolonged.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously awarded to the claimant the sum of $1,200.</p>
                        <p>The cases of John C. Rahming, No. 7; Joseph Eneas, No. 126; and Joseph W.
                            Binney, No. 352, were of substantially the same character, and were all
                            decided at the same time. These claimants were all domiciled in the city
                            of New York, and there engaged in trade. All were carrying on a
                            considerable trade with the port of Nassau, and were arrested on the
                            charge of carrying on an unlawful traffic with the enemies of the United
                            States under color of their trade with Nassau. Rahming and Eneas were
                            both arrested on the 31st December, 1863, and confined <pb n="64"
                                xml:id="pg_64" facs="0120"/>under military authority in Fort
                            Lafayette, until July 2, 1864, and then discharged without trial, on
                            giving bonds for their appearance if called on for trial by the United
                            States authorities. Rahming had also been previously arrested, on a
                            charge of having shipped arms to the rebels, in September, 1861, and had
                            then been detained as a prisoner in Fort Lafayette for fifteen days.
                            Binney was arrested on the 14th June, 1864, imprisoned in Fort Lafayette
                            under military authority for five weeks, and then transferred to a jail
                            in the city of New York, where he was detained seventeen days longer and
                            was then discharged by General Dix without any bonds or security
                            required.</p>
                        <p>In each of these cases it was alleged by the claimant, and proofs were
                            taken in support of such allegations, that the claimants were innocent
                            of the offences charged against them; that their imprisonment was
                            unnecessarily and improperly protracted; and that they received improper
                            and unnecessarily severe treatment during their imprisonment. Proofs
                            were taken on the part of the United States to show the charges against
                            them well founded, and to rebut the charges of improper treatment. In
                            each of the cases allegations were also made of large resulting damages
                            to the claimants by reason of their imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>Rahming, by his memorial, claimed damages $580,800, besides interest. He
                            was awarded by the majority of the commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            dissenting on the question of amount merely) the sum of $38,500.</p>
                        <p>Eneas claimed damages $720,000, besides interest, and was awarded $1,540,
                            all the commissioners joining.</p>
                        <p>Binney claimed $100,000, besides interest, and was awarded $5,390, all
                            the commissioners joining.</p>
                        <p>In each of the cases I am advised that the decision turned upon questions
                            of fact, all the commissioners agreeing that the proofs, though
                            sufficient to warrant the arrest in each case, did not leave the truth
                            of the charges free from doubt; and that the detention of the prisoners
                            without trial was unnecessarily protracted. Mr. Commissioner Frazer,
                            read an opinion in the case of Rahming, which will be found in the
                            appendix, I.</p>
                        <p>In the case of John Carville Stovin, No. 23, claimant was arrested at
                            Cumberland, Md., in October, 1861, on the charge of disloyalty, in
                            attending secession meetings in Cumberland, and being the means of
                            transmitting information to the enemy. He was taken to Fort Mc-Henry,
                            there detained for about five weeks, and discharged without trial. He
                            alleged that his business as a manufacturer at Cumberland was stopped,
                            and in effect destroyed by his arrest, and claimed damages $380,794.27,
                            besides interest; including, however, some fire-wood, hay, corn, and
                            oats, alleged to have been taken and appropriated by the United States
                            soldiers. He alleged, also, ill-treatment while in confinement. Proofs
                            were taken on both sides on the question of his <pb n="65"
                                xml:id="pg_65" facs="0121"/>disloyal conduct, and it was contended
                            on the part of the United States that the facts of the case justified
                            his arrest as a disloyal person, openly giving aid and comfort to the
                            rebellion by his language and expressions of sympathy, in a village
                            situated upon the frontiers of the enemy’s country, and where such
                            conduct involved danger to the military operations of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant the charges of disloyal conduct and language
                            were denied, and proof was adduced to show him a law-abiding and
                            peaceable inhabitant.</p>
                        <p>The commission gave an award to the claimant of $8,300, all the
                            commissioners joining.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Frank Russell Reading, No. 43, the claimant was arrested
                            in the city of Washington on the 6th July, 1864, that city then being
                            threatened by the rebel forces under General Early; was brought to trial
                            before a military commission in Washington on the charge of uttering
                            disloyal and treasonable language in the District of Columbia when
                            threatened by the enemy, such language being calculated to give aid,
                            comfort, and assistance to the enemy. He was found guilty by the
                            commission, and sentenced to imprisonment for five years, with hard
                            labor, at the Dry Tortugas, or such other military prison as the
                            Secretary of War might select. Under this sentence he was imprisoned at
                            Fort Delaware from the 30th August, 1864, till 1st June, 1865.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the military
                            commission was a lawful tribunal, competent for the trial and punishment
                            of military offences, and having full jurisdiction of the case of the
                            claimant, both as to subject-matter and person; that at the time of his
                            arrest and trial Washington was a city in military occupation, environed
                            by forts of the United States, occupied and defended by their armies,
                            the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the
                            United States, and, as the capital of the country, always a vital point
                            of attack for the rebel forces, and at this specific time the actual
                            objective point of a vigorous and determined attack by the enemy, who
                            actually reached, as their advanced post, on the 12th July, Fort
                            Stevens, within the limits of the District of Columbia and within four
                            or five miles of the Capitol.</p>
                        <p>That the offence charged against Reading was a purely military offence,
                            of which the civil tribunals had not cognizance, and so was not within
                            the principle held by the Supreme Court in the case of Milligan, (4
                            Wall., 2.)</p>
                        <p>That Reading having appeared in person and by counsel before the military
                            tribunal, and having pleaded in chief, without raising any question to
                            the jurisdiction, could not be heard to question the jurisdiction of the
                            tribunal as to his person merely; and that the commission having by law
                            jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the charge, the failure to object
                            to jurisdiction as to the person obviated all question as to <pb n="66"
                                xml:id="pg_66" facs="0122"/>their complete jurisdiction. The counsel
                            for the United States cited the case of Vallandigham, (1 Wall.,
                            243.)</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the military tribunal
                            had no jurisdiction whatever, and that the imprisonment of the claimant
                            under it was wholly without authority of law.</p>
                        <p>The commission gave a unanimous award in favor of the claimant for
                            $15,400.</p>
                        <p>In the case of John I. Shaver, No. 51, the memorial alleged that the
                            claimant, being at the time domiciled in Canada, but travelling in the
                            United States on the business of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, a
                            Canadian corporation, of which he was an agent, was arrested at Detroit,
                            on the 15th October, 1801, by direction of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of
                            State of the United States; that he was taken thence to Fort Lafayette,
                            in New York Harbor, and confined there, and subsequently at Fort Warren,
                            in Boston Harbor, until the 6th January, 1862. He alleged that by his
                            arrest he was thrown out of lucrative employment as agent of the railway
                            company named; that by it he lost the confidence of his employers and
                            was unable to regain his position after his release; and that he
                            suffered large pecuniary losses in consequence. He claimed damages
                            $100,000.</p>
                        <p>The arrest was made upon information communicated to Mr. Seward that the
                            claimant was engaged in conveying communications between the rebels in
                            Canada and those within the insurrectionary States. The proofs failed to
                            sustain the charge, and it appeared that Mr. Kennedy, chief of police of
                            the city of New York, immediately after the arrest of the claimant,
                            reported to the State Department that he found no proofs to warrant his
                            detention, or to implicate him in any improper communication with the
                            enemy.</p>
                        <p>The commission awarded the claimant $30,204, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            dissenting on the question of amount only.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Samuel G. Levy, No. 61, it appeared that the claimant, a
                            resident of Canada, on landing in Boston from a British steamship from
                            Liverpool in May, 1864, was taken thence to New York, and there detained
                            for about eight days, on a charge of being engaged in blockade-running.
                            At the end of that time he was discharged upon giving bail for his
                            appearance within six months, if required. He alleged large
                            consequential damages by interference with his due attention to his
                            business, and by the enforced breaking of an engagement of marriage in
                            consesequence of his arrest, and claimed as damages, £20,000.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously gave him an award of $930.</p>
                        <p>In the case of James Stott, No. 271, it appeared that the claimant,
                            domiciled in the State of Maine, was arrested at Dexter, Me., September
                            2, 1863, on the charge of being a deserter from a cavalry regiment in
                            the United States service; was sent thence to the regiment from which he
                            was <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0123"/>alleged to have deserted, at
                            Warren ton, Va., where it plainly appeared that the charge was
                            unfounded, it being a case of mistaken identity. He was detained until
                            the 9th of November, 1863; and, for the purpose of making him some
                            compensation as to loss of time, and of giving him transportation back
                            to his home, was mustered into the United States service and discharged
                            with the pay of a private soldier for the time he had been detained, and
                            with transportation back to his home.</p>
                        <p>An award was made for $775 in favor of the claimant, in which all the
                            commissioners joined.</p>
                        <p>John I. Crawford, No. 79, was arrested in the city of New York, on the
                            10th of May, 1864; sent to Fort Lafayette, and there detained until the
                            27th of July, 1864, when he was brought to trial before a military
                            commission in the city of New York, on the charge of violation of the
                            laws of war, in passing through the military lines of the enemy, first,
                            from South Carolina, by way of Richmond, to New York; second, from New
                            York again, by way of Nassau and Wilmington, through the blockade, to
                            South Carolina; and again from South Carolina, by way of Richmond, to
                            New York; and also by purchasing goods in New York, and sending the in
                            thence through the lines to Richmond, Va. He was, convicted on all the
                            specifications except that relating to the purchasing and sending of
                            goods, and was sentenced to give bonds in such sum and with such
                            sureties as should be satisfactory to the general in command of the
                            department, that he would not visit, traffic, or correspond with the
                            States in rebellion, nor give aid, comfort, or information to the enemy
                            during the war, in default of giving such bonds to be confined at hard
                            labor during the war. The bond was immediately given, and Crawford was
                            discharged. The proofs before the commission fully sustained the
                            findings of the military tribunal.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the military tribunal
                            was without jurisdiction, and that the claimant’s imprisonment and
                            detention were unlawful.</p>
                        <p>The memorial claimed $500,000 as damages, and the commission unanimously
                            disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>In the case of John Carmody, No. 85, it appeared that the claimant,
                            domiciled in New Orleans, was, in March, 1865, conscripted into the
                            military service of the United States; the notice of his conscription
                            requiring him to report for military service was addressed to him by the
                            name of John Kemdy, and on receiving it he procured from the British
                            consul at New Orleans a certificate of his British nationality, which he
                            alleged that he presented to the officer in charge of the office at
                            which he was required to report, but two days after was arrested by a
                            squad of United States soldiers, and was detained in a military prison
                            for some five or six weeks. The arrest and detention evidently arose
                            from mistake growing out of the confusion of names. The memorial <pb
                                n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0124"/>claimed $100,000 damages, besides
                            interest, and the commission unanimously awarded the claimant $500.</p>
                        <p>In the case of William Patrick, No. 97, it appeared that the claimant a
                            British merchant, domiciled in New York, was, on the 28th August, 1861,
                            arrested and committed to Fort Lafayette, where he was detained till the
                            13th September following, when he was discharged. His arrest was based
                            on the charge that the firm in New York of which he was a member, and
                            which had a branch house also at Mobile, Ala., was a channel for
                            carrying on correspondence between rebels in Europe and those in the
                            insurrectionary States. Representations by highly respectable citizens
                            of New York of Mr. Patrick’s loyalty were made to the Secretary of
                            State, and the British minister also intervened in his behalf.
                            Investigation showed that the charge against Mr. Patrick was without
                            foundation, and he was discharged after a confinement of seventeen days.
                            The proofs established Mr. Patrick to have been a gentleman of high
                            social and business standing, and also to have been in conduct marked by
                            loyalty and good faith toward the Government during the rebellion, and
                            to have furnished liberal contributions in its aid. His arrest was
                            undoubtedly caused by false or erroneous information.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of the claimant punitory damages were claimed. On the part of
                            the United States it was insisted that no such damages could be allowed;
                            that Mr. Patrick, domiciled within the United States, was exposed in the
                            same degree with citizens of those States to arrest on false charges or
                            erroneous information, and that, having been discharged within a
                            reasonable time for inquiry to be made, he was not entitled to claim
                            damages against the United States. That if any damages were awarded to
                            him, they should be such only as would afford him fair compensation for
                            the injury inflicted.</p>
                        <p>The memorial claimed $100,000, besides interest. The commission awarded
                            the claimant $5,160, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting on the question
                            of amount.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Joseph J. Bevitt, No. 104, the claimant, until that time
                            domiciled in South Carolina and Virginia, left Richmond in April, 1863,
                            and passed through the rebel lines to the Potomac River, was there taken
                            on board a United States transport steamer on the 30th April, 1863,
                            taken to Washington, detained in the Old Capitol prison until the 19th
                            May, and then sent back into the confederacy.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant, it was contended that Bevitt, being a
                            British subject, and not having offended against the laws of the United
                            States, or taken part in the domestic strife then in progress, was
                            entitled to such egress without molestation by the public
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the attempt of
                            the claimant to enter the loyal portion of the United States from the
                            enemy’s country, and through his military lines, after having
                            voluntarily <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0125"/>remained within the
                            enemy’s country during two years of the war, was one which the United
                            States might lawfully prevent or punish, and that their sending him back
                            into the enemy’s country, from which he came, was an act permitted by
                            public law.</p>
                        <p>The commission disallowed the claim, Mr. Commissioner Gurney
                            dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the case of William Ashton, No. 325, the claimant, until then
                            domiciled in the State of South Carolina, in February, 1863, came north
                            through the Federal lines under a pass from the confederate General Lee,
                            and while crossing the Potomac River into the State of Maryland was
                            arrested by the naval patrol, on the 7th February, 1863. He was taken to
                            Washington, there detained until the 11th May, 1863, and then sent back
                            through the lines into the enemy’s country.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the case was
                            parallel with that of Bevitt, above reported, and that the arrest,
                            detention, and return of the claimant were lawful acts under the
                            recognized laws of war.</p>
                        <p>The commission awarded to him the sum of $6,000, Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            dissenting.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned finds difficulty in reconciling the decision of the
                            commission in this case with that in the case of Bevitt. It may be
                            noted, however, that Bevitt was detained but twenty days before being
                            sent back, while Ashton was detained three months and four days.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Thomas Barry, No. 127, the claimant, domiciled at New
                            Orleans, alleged that, on the 15th March, 1864, he was arrested without
                            any cause or provocation, but arbitrarily and maliciously, by a provost
                            -marshal under the orders of General Banks, then in command of the
                            department; was committed to the parish prison, there confined for ten
                            weeks, and then released on giving a bond conditioned that he should
                            report daily to the provost-marshal in the city of New Orleans. That he
                            continued so to report until the 31st December, 1864, when the bond was
                            cancelled and the claimant fully discharged. He claimed damages $50,000.
                            The proofs showed that he was arrested in the act of clandestinely and
                            in disguise attempting to pass from New Orleans through the lines into
                            the enemy’s country, having upon his person letters to residents within
                            the enemy’s lines, and carrying confederate money—the use of which was
                            forbidden by the Federal authorities. That only two months before he had
                            perpetrated the same offence in the same disguise; had visited many
                            places within the enemy’s lines, and had returned into the Federal lines
                            in the same clandestine manner. Before his arrest he had applied for
                            permits to go within the confederate lines for the alleged purpose of
                            looking up and bringing back cotton alleged to have been owned by him;
                            but such permission had been refused.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0126"/>
                        <p>In the case of Henry Glover, No. 134, the claimant, a resident of the
                            State of Georgia, was, in November, 1864, in company with a companion,
                            in Jones County, Georgia, within the enemy's territory, overtaken by a
                            detachment of cavalry from the corps of General Kilpatrick, forming a
                            part of the flanking force of General Sherman’s army in the march from
                            Atlanta to Savannah. His companion fled and was fired upon; claimant
                            waited, was arrested and detained for twenty-four hours, when he was
                            discharged, it appearing that he was a civilian and a British
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>His claim was disallowed, all the commissioners agreeing.</p>
                        <p>The case of Thomas H. Facer, No. 203, was similar in character to that of
                            Glover, and was disallowed in like manner.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the administrators of James Syme, No. 139, it appeared
                            that the decedent had been for many years domiciled at New Orleans, and
                            there carrying on a large trade as a wholesale and retail druggist; that
                            on the 28th August, 1862, he was arrested and taken before Major-General
                            Butler, then in command of the Department of the Gulf, and there
                            arraigned on charges styled in the memorial “false, wicked, and
                            malicious,” to the effect that he had aided and abetted the so-called
                            confederates by the shipment of sulphur, drugs, and medicines into their
                            lines, and that he had violated his neutrality. General Butler? being
                            satisfied of the truth of the charges, condemned him, without the
                            intervention of any court or military tribunal, to be imprisoned at Fort
                            Pickens for three years at hard labor with ball and chain; the ball and
                            chain were, however, within a few days, and before the commencement of
                            execution of the order, remitted. He was detained in confinement at New
                            Orleans for about six weeks; then sent under guard to Fort Pickens, in
                            Pensacola Harbor, Florida, and there confined until about the 1st March,
                            1863, when he was brought back to New Orleans, and there detained during
                            an investigation by a military commission, which reported him not guilty
                            of the charges upon which he was imprisoned Pending the proceedings of
                            this commission he was discharged from confinement by order of General
                            Banks, who had succeeded General Butler in command, on giving a bond,
                            with surety, in the sum of $20,000, conditioned for his appearance on
                            requirement by the Government. Upon the report of the commission the
                            bond was canceled August 28, 1863. At the same time with his arrest his
                            drug-store and contents, in New Orleans, were seized and appropriated to
                            the use of the United States, and remained in their possession until
                            about the 1st May, 1864, when the store, with so much of the stock of
                            drugs, &amp;c., as had not been used, was surrendered to his possession
                            by order of the War Department.</p>
                        <p>A large amount of testimony was taken on both sides upon the question of
                            his guilt or innocence of the charges on which he was imprisoned.</p>
                        <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0127"/>
                        <p>On the part of the United States, it was also proved that the decedent,
                            in November, 1861, and again in March, 1862, had accepted commissions as
                            surgeon—first with the rank of captain, and afterwards with the rank of
                            major—in the battalion of the Louisiana State militia designated as the
                            British Fusiliers; that this battalion was a regularly organized portion
                            of the State militia of the rebel State of Louisiana, but was organized
                            under the reservation that its members should be required to serve only
                            within the limits of the city of New Orleans; that, on the acceptance of
                            these commissions, the decedent was required by law to take, and did
                            take, an oath faithfully to discharge the duties of the office to which
                            he had been appointed, and to support, protect, and defend the
                            constitution of the State of Louisiana and of the Confederate States;
                            that at the time of accepting these com missions, respectively, the
                            decedent was above the age of forty-five years, and was exempt by the
                            laws of the State of Louisiana from militia service, by reason of age,
                            even if otherwise liable by reason of nationality or domicile. Evidence
                            was also given on the part of the United States to the effect that Dr.
                            Syme, shortly after the occupation of New Orleans by the Federal forces,
                            refused to sell medical and surgical supplies to medical officers of the
                            United States Army. Dr. Syme died in January, 1872, before the filing of
                            the memorial, leaving a widow and one son entitled to inherit his
                            estate, both born within the United States and always domiciled
                            there.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that by the acceptance
                            of these commissions and the taking of the oaths above recited, Dr. Syme
                            had deprived himself of the condition of a neutral alien and assumed the
                            character of an enemy of the United States, and was not entitled to a
                            standing as a British subject under the treaty; that the proofs fully
                            sustained the charges upon which he was condemned by General Butler;
                            that if any doubt existed upon the proofs now before the commission as
                            to the truth of those charges, the evidence before General Butler and
                            upon which he acted was certainly sufficient to sustain his finding and
                            to justify the condemnation pronounced by him upon the proofs before
                            him; that as military commander of a captured city within the enemy’s
                            country, then strictly and solely under military government, General
                            Butler was vested with full authority to administer military law, either
                            in person or through military courts and tribunals organized under his
                            order; that the offense of which he found Dr. Syme guilty was a crime
                            under military law of a high grade, and justifying the sentence
                            pronounced upon him.</p>
                        <p>The memorial claimed damages for the arrest and imprisonment, $100,000;
                            for the drugs and other property of the decedent taken and appropriated
                            by the United States, (less the value of the amount returned,) and the
                            rent of the store, $166,925; and damages by the breaking up of the
                            business of the decedent, and the loss of profits which he would have
                            derived from the business, $150,000, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made an award <pb
                                n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0128"/>in favor of the claimants for
                            $116,200. I am advised that this award included nothing for damages for
                            imprisonment, but was made solely in respect of the drugs and other
                            property taken and appropriated by the United States, and the rent of
                            the drug-store while occupied by them. Mr. Commissioner Frazer expressed
                            his views upon the case as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Being over the military age, and exempt from military duty as a
                                    druggist also, Dr. Syme took a commission in the British
                                    Fusiliers and an oath of office to support the rebel
                                    confederacy, and evinced his hostility further, as I deem the
                                    weight of the evidence to show, by refusing to sell goods to the
                                    United States after New Orleans fell into Federal possession.
                                    This made him an actual enemy, and he could have no standing to
                                    prosecute a claim before this commission. The beneficiaries—his
                                    wife and child—have none, because they are Americans. His
                                    condemnation by General Butler was upon what appeared at the
                                    time to be satisfactory evidence, though it was subsequently
                                    shown before the military commission, organized under the order
                                    of General Banks, that he was probably innocent of the charges
                                    upon which he was arrested. He was restored to liberty as soon
                                    as an investigation could conveniently be had; and what remained
                                    unconsumed of his confiscated goods was also restored, together
                                    with the possession of his building.</p>

                        <p>In so much of this opinion of Mr. Commissioner Frazer as relates to the
                            sufficiency of the evidence upon which General Butler acted to sustain
                            his finding and sentence, and as relates to the probable actual
                            innocence of Br. Syme as appearing before the commission, I am advised
                            that the majority of the commission concurred.</p>
                        <p>In the case of William B. Booth, No. 143, a claim was made for $56,000
                            damages for the alleged wrongful arrest of the claimant in the
                            neighborhood of Fort Jackson, Louisiana, and subsequent imprisonment. He
                            was arrested by United States soldiers on the 8th August, 1862, taken to
                            Fort Jackson, and there confined till the 28th August; then sent to Fort
                            Pickens, Pensacola Harbor, and there confined till the 15th August,
                            1863; then taken back to New Orleans and detained till the 26th August,
                            1863, when he was unconditionally released.</p>
                        <p>Previous to his arrest, Dr. Booth, who resided in Louisiana, two miles
                            from the forts and outside the lines of military occupation by the
                            United States, had been on the request of Dr. Gordon, the surgeon of the
                            forts, visiting and prescribing for the prisoners and Federal soldiers
                            at the forts. Gen. Neal Dow, the commander, learning the fact, had
                            notified him that he could not be permitted to visit the forts without
                            taking the oath of allegiance, or giving his parole of honor not to
                            communicate information to the enemy. Dr. Booth declined to do either of
                            these things. After his arrest he still continued his refusal to give
                            the required parole, and, persisting in his refusal, General Dow ordered
                            his transfer to Fort Pickens and his detention there. At this time Forts
                            Jackson and Saint Philip, lying on the opposite banks of the Mississippi
                            some one hundred miles or more below the city of New Orleans, were
                            occupied by a United States force of about six hundred soldiers, and
                            about the same number of liberated slaves, under the command of General
                            Dow. The garrisons were weak, and a <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73"
                                facs="0129"/>large number of the troops actually there were
                            prostrated by sickness. General Dow deemed it of the utmost importance
                            that a knowledge of the weakness of his garrison should be kept from the
                            enemy. The refusal of Dr. Booth to give the required parole roused the
                            suspicions of General Dow, and when persisted in, led to his sending the
                            claim ant to Fort Pickens. During his stay at Fort Pickens, and after
                            his retransfer thence to New Orleans, he still persisted in refusing to
                            give the required parole, and was finally discharged, after a
                            confinement of nearly thirteen months, unconditionally and without
                            parole. Lord Lyons, during his confinement, in a letter to Mr. Coppell,
                            British consul at New Orleans, stated that the required parole was
                            deemed not unreasonable by Her Majesty’s government, after consulting
                            the law officers of the Grown.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was insisted that the arrest and
                            detention of Dr. Booth were warranted as measures of just military
                            precaution in regard to an enemy by domicile possessed of knowledge, the
                            communication of which to the enemy would be highly dangerous to the
                            United States, and who, by his refusal to give this proper and
                            reasonable pledge, had, in the language of Lord Lyons, entitled the
                            United States to treat him as a suspected person.</p>
                        <p>The memorial of Dr. Booth also included claims to the amount of $83,890,
                            besides interest, for property of the claimant alleged to have been
                            taken and appropriated by the United States.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) awarded to the
                            claimant the sum of $24,900, which award was, as I am advised, wholly in
                            respect of property taken, and included nothing on account of the arrest
                            and imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>John McCann, No. 173, and John Murta, No. 195, natives of Ireland and
                            domiciled in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, were arrested there—McCann in
                            September, 1863, and Murta in November, 1863–—by United States troops,
                            under authority of a provost-marshal; were taken to Fort Mifflin and
                            there confined, McCann till March and Murta till April, 1864.</p>
                        <p>The proofs showed that at the time of their arrest an organized
                            conspiracy existed in Luzerne County and vicinity to resist the Federal
                            draft for troops; that great violence was used against Federal officers;
                            that open defiance of the Federal authority was made in public meetings
                            of the mining population; that loyal citizens sustaining the Government
                            had been assassinated, and measures had been adopted to ambuscade and
                            massacre Federal troops, should they be sent there to enforce the draft;
                            that the principal disturbing element in this conspiracy was the Irish
                            Catholic miners; that not only secret associations were formed, but
                            public meetings were openly held for the avowed purpose of stopping the
                            mines and thus stopping the war; that a large number of persons regarded
                            as the ringleaders and most dangerous persons in this movement were
                            arrested, and among them these two claimants. No proof was made of the
                            complicity of either of the claimants <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74"
                                facs="0130"/>with the actual resistance to the draft or violation of
                            law; but Murta was shown to have been a member of the organization known
                            as the “Knights of the Golden Circle,” created to oppose the draft and
                            aid the rebellion. Neither of the claimants was ever brought to
                            trial.</p>
                        <p>In the case of McCann an award was made in favor of the claimant for
                            $3,000, in which all the commissioners joined. In the case of Murta an
                            award was made for $1,200, Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Thomas Riley, No. 192, the claimant, a resident of Luzerne
                            County, Pennsylvania, was drafted into the United States military
                            service in November, 1863, was taken to Philadelphia and there held in
                            the United States military barracks for about six weeks, when he was
                            taken sick and sent to the hospital, and there remained confined by
                            disease till the 6th of April, 1864, when he was discharged by the War
                            Department, through the intervention of Lord Lyons, as being a subject
                            of Great Britain, having received his pay as a soldier for the time
                            during which he was held.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that he was held simply
                            in consequence of his failure to comply with the regulations of the
                            provost-marshal’s department in regard to showing proof of alienage. The
                            case showed, however, that the proofs of his alienage were submitted by
                            Lord Lyons to Mr. Seward in November, 1863, within a few days after his
                            arrest, and his discharge was not ordered till about four months
                            after.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously awarded him the sum of $300.</p>
                        <p>Edward McCabe, No. 197, was drafted into the military service of the
                            United States in Queens County, New York, in September, 1883. He
                            appeared before the enrolling-board and claimed exemption; was informed
                            of the regulation prescribing the method of making the necessary proof;
                            was given time to file it, but failing to do so was arrested by order of
                            the provost-marshal and detained for two days, when, having furnished
                            the necessary proof, he was discharged.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed his claim.</p>
                        <p>Patrick J. O’Mulligan, No. 476, was drafted in Cayuga County, New York,
                            in October, 1863. He appeared before the board of enrollment and claimed
                            exemption as a British subject, but failed to comply with the
                            regulations for the proof of alienage. He was detained for twenty-four
                            hours, and on physical examination by the surgeon was found unfit for
                            military service and was discharged. For these grievances he claimed the
                            sum of $800,000, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>His claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <p>In the ease of Mary Sophia Hill, No. 198, the claimant, a native of
                            Ireland, was domiciled during the rebellion and for many years before in
                            New Orleans. At the time of the capture of New Orleans by the <pb n="75"
                                xml:id="pg_75" facs="0131"/>Federal forces in 1862, she was in
                            attendance on the confederate hospitals in Virginia, but shortly after
                            returned to New Orleans under a proper pass. In 1863 she went to
                            Ireland, and returned to New Orleans, taking the oath of neutrality on
                            landing. She again left New Orleans in the fall of 1863 under a pass and
                            went to Virginia, where she remained for five months “rendering
                            assistance in the hospitals and to prisoners by means of flags of
                            truce.” In 1864 she returned to New Orleans, and having no pass was
                            arrested and detained in prison for two days; when, having satisfied the
                            provost-marshal that she was a British subject, she was released on
                            bail. After her discharge and while sick she alleged that she was called
                            upon by a woman who gave the name of Ellen Williams, and gave her a note
                            purporting to be from Gen. Tom Taylor, an officer of the confederate
                            service commanding a post within the confederate lines in Louisiana.
                            This woman informed claimant that she was going through the lines into
                            the confederacy if she could get a pass from General Banks, and offered
                            to take letters from the claimant. Claimant gave to her a letter to
                            General Taylor, acknowledging the receipt of his letter, and saying to
                            him, “Communicate and state what you require, and I will do all in my
                            power; I will be here until the end of July.” She also gave to her a
                            letter addressed to her brother, a soldier in the confederate service in
                            Virginia, in which she denounced the “Yankees;” and said, among other
                            things, “We have accounts of the battles in Richmond, but so hashed up
                            to suit northern palates you can make neither head nor tail of the
                            affair; but through my spectacles I see General Grant and his
                            well-whipped army with their faces toward Washington and their backs to
                            the hated city of Richmond, except those who take their summer residence
                            at Libby. Tell the boys Banks has made a splendid commissary to Dick
                            Taylor’s army, and they were so ungrateful as also to whip him, and very
                            badly.” She also gave this woman another letter of similar character,
                            addressed to Mrs. Graham, a person living in Montgomery, Alabama, within
                            the lines of the confederacy.</p>
                        <p>These letters were delivered on the 20th May, 1864; and within a few days
                            after she was arrested by an officer of the provost-marshal’s bureau,
                            committed to prison, and there detained until July, when she was brought
                            before a military commission and tried on the charge of “holding
                            correspondence with and giving intelligence to the enemy, in violation
                            of the Fifty-seventh Article of War,” the specifications being the
                            written letters above named. She was found guilty of the charge except
                            the words “and giving intelligence to;” and was sentenced to “be
                            confined during the war, at such place as the commanding general may
                            direct.” The proceedings and findings of the commission were approved by
                            Major-General Hurlbut, then in command; but the sentence was so modified
                            as to direct the claimant to be sent into the so-called confederacy as
                            an enemy; and the provost-marshal-general was charged with the execution
                            of the order.</p>

                        <p>At the time of her trial New Orleans was still under military government,
                            but the United States district court had been reorganized under Judge
                            Durell, and was in operation in that city. No State tribunals were in
                            operation, nor any local tribunals, except under authority and
                            permission of the military commander.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended, first, that the claimant
                            was not amenable to military jurisdiction, but must be tried, if at all,
                            before the civil tribunals; second, that if amenable to military
                            jurisdiction, the commission before which she was tried was not a
                            competent tribunal; that by the Fifty-Seventh Article of War (2 Stat. at
                            L., 366) the only military tribunal having cognizance of such an offence
                            was a court-martial, a tribunal distinct and different from a military
                            commission; third, that the finding of the military commission that she
                            was guilty of the charge except the words “and giving intelligence to,”
                            was in fact an acquittal, correspondence with the enemy without giving
                            him intelligence not being a military offence or a violation of the
                            article above referred to; fourth, that the commanding officer had no
                            authority to change the punishment directed by the sentence of the
                            court, and substitute banishment into the confederacy for imprisonment;
                            that this substitution was not with the consent of the claimant, and was
                            not a mitigation of punishment; fifth, that the letters were not in fact
                            sent into the confederacy, but were delivered by the messenger to the
                            United States military authorities in New Orleans, and that the evidence
                            tended to prove that the pretended messenger to whom they were delivered
                            was in fact a spy and agent of the United States.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the offence
                            charged against the claimant was a military offence purely, not
                            cognizable by the civil tribunals; that the claimant, domiciled in a
                            city within the enemy’s country and recently captured from the enemy,
                            held by military power only, and governed only by military authority,
                            was amenable to military jurisdiction; that the tribunal before which
                            she was tried was a competent military tribunal, organized under
                            sufficient military authority, and having jurisdiction both of the
                            subject-matter and of the person of the claimant; that irrespective of
                            the proceedings, finding, or sentence of the commission, the commanding
                            general had ull authority to expel the claimant from the city and send
                            her within the enemy’s lines, on satisfactory evidence of her active
                            sympathy with the rebellion, and of her attempt merely to communicate
                            with the enemy, and that the modification and mitigation by the
                            commanding general of the punishment decreed by the military tribunal
                            was one of lawful power, and was not a matter of which the claimant
                            could rightfully complain.</p>
                        <p>The commission gave an award in favor of the claimant for $1,560, Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting. This claimant was the same person whose
                            original memorial (No. 8) was dismissed by the commission on account of
                            its improper and indecorous language.</p>
                        <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0133"/>
                        <p>The case of Colin J. Nicolson, No. 253, may properly be reported in
                            connection with that of Miss Hill. Nicolson, a native of Scotland, had
                            been domiciled in New Orleans since 1852. He was arrested in that city
                            on the 15th of September, 1864; was detained in prison till the 22d of
                            November, 1864, when he was brought before a general court-martial in
                            that city and tried on the charges, first, of relieving the enemy with
                            money, by investing money in bonds of the Confederate States and
                            transmitting the same to England for sale there; and, second, of holding
                            correspondence with the enemy by letters passing between himself and one
                            Violett, an enemy of the United States, resident at Mobile; and in and
                            by such correspondence devising means for bringing cotton out of the
                            confederacy, and disposing of it for the joint benefit of himself and
                            Violett, and for negotiating and selling bonds of the Confederate
                            States. He was convicted on both charges, and was sentenced to
                            imprisonment at Fort Jefferson, Fla., or at such other place as the
                            commanding general should direct, for five years. The sentence was
                            approved by General Canby, commanding, and the claimant was committed to
                            confinement at Fort Jefferson, where he remained for about nine months,
                            when he was pardoned by the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The questions involved and the doctrines maintained by the respective
                            counsel in the case of Miss Hill were urged upon the commission in this
                            case. The counsel for the claimant further contended that the dealing in
                            bonds of the enemy in New Orleans and transmitting them thence to
                            England for sale was not a “relieving of the enemy with money,” or in
                            any manner a giving of aid to the enemy, and that the correspondence of
                            the claimant with Violett involved no aid or comfort to the enemy, gave
                            no information to them, and constituted no military offence. He cited
                            the first article of the treaty between the United States and Great
                            Britain of 3d July, 1865, (8 Stat, at L.;) also Milligan’s case, (4
                            Wall., 2;) Egan’s case, (5 Blatchford, C. C. R., 320;) the Venus, (2

                        <p>The memorial claimed $500,000 damages. The claim was disallowed by the
                            commission, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the case of James McVey, No. 208, the claimant alleged that he was
                            twice arrested. It appeared that the first arrest was within the enemy’s
                            lines, when he was detained for some four weeks to prevent his
                            communication with the enemy. The second time he was arrested while in
                            the act of carrying goods across the lines from the enemy’s country, and
                            was held in confinement several weeks. His claim was unanimously
                            disallowed.</p>
                        <p>Substantially similar to this last case, in regard to the character of
                            the arrest, were the cases of Isaac Milner, No. 207, in which an award
                                <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0134"/>was made in favor of the
                            claimant for property, but including nothing for the alleged arrest; of
                            Samuel Simpson, No. 217, which was unanimously disallowed; of John
                            Carew, No. 224, which was disallowed, Mr. Commissioner Gurney
                            dissenting; of Henry F. White, No. 233, which was unanimously
                            disallowed; and of John Gale, No. 247, in which there was an award for
                            property, but including nothing on account of the arrest or
                            imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Joseph W. Scott, No. 226, the claimant, domiciled at
                            Jacksonville, Fla., was there arrested by order of the commanding
                            officer in November, 1864, on the charge of disloyalty, and detained in
                            confinement for some three months. Jacksonville was an inland town, on
                            the Saint John’s River, which came into the hands of the United States
                            forces in February, 1864, and from that time to the close of the war was
                            occupied by them; but the rebel forces, most of the time, were within
                            its immediate vicinity.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was insisted that the military
                            commander was necessarily invested with absolute power for the control
                            of the city; and that it was his duty to take such measures as should
                            prevent inhabitants disloyally disposed from communicating with the
                            enemy; and that nothing in the case of Mr. Scott showed an abuse of this
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant in respect of property taken
                            by the United States troops, but it included nothing for
                            imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>In the case of James T. Munroe, No. 235, claimant had embarked at New
                            Orleans in August, 1864, on board a steamer for Matamoras, Mexico, with
                            the machinery for erecting a saw-mill at that place. The steamer was
                            stopped at Fort Jackson on the charge of having contraband goods on
                            board intended for Texas, brought back to New Orleans, and the claimant
                            was there detained by the military authorities for two days on board the
                            steamer, and for twelve hours in the military prison at that city. It
                            appeared that, while he was in confinement, his trunk onboard the
                            steamer was broken open, either by the provost-guard or in consequence
                            of their negligence, and money, wearing apparel, and other articles were
                            stolen from it. On complaint made to Major-General Canby, in command of
                            the city, an order was made by him declaring these transactions, if
                            true, to be exceedingly discreditable to the guards, and directing the
                            provost-marshal to take measures to bring the offenders to justice. An
                            investigation was ordered, but the offenders did not appear to have been
                            discovered, and no reparation was made to the claimant.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was urged that the arrest and
                            detention were lawful and reasonable for the purpose of inquiry as to
                            the character of the vessel, and that the United States were not liable
                            to reclamation for the theft of the claimant’s property.</p>
                        <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0135"/>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant for $1,540, in which all the
                            commissioners joined.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Susan B. Jackson, No. 255, the claimant, in behalf of
                            herself and her four minor children, claimed damages for the arrest of
                            John Jackson, the husband of the claimant, at Knoxville, Tenn., and his
                            banishment within the enemy’s lines, with his family, in January, 1864.
                            It appeared that Dr. Jackson, the husband, had been a resident of
                            Knoxville for some years and until after the breaking out of the war;
                            that he had sent his family to England in August, 1861, and himself
                            followed them in June, 1862; that he returned to New York in October,
                            1862, and in January, 1863, having obtained the proper permission,
                            returned to Knoxville for the alleged purpose of disposing of his
                            property there. Instead of disposing of his property he remained at
                            Knoxville, and there entered into trade. Both before his departure for
                            England and after his return, in 1863, he had been an open and active
                            sympathizer with the rebellion, denouncing the United States Government
                            and encouraging and aiding the rebels down to the surrender of Knoxville
                            to the United States forces in September, 1863. Evidence was also given
                            on the part of the United States showing conduct evincing a hostile
                            spirit toward the United States Government. On the 29th January, 1864,
                            the following notice was addressed to him by General Foster’s
                            provost-marshal: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Owing to your persistent disloyalty to the Government of the
                                    United States, it has been decided to send you and your family
                                    south of the Federal lines. You will, therefore, be prepared to
                                    start on receiving further notice.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The further notice was served on the 30th January, requiring him to be
                            ready to depart on the 3d February, on which day Jackson and his family
                            were sent through the rebel lines under a flag of truce.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant in respect of property of her
                            own appropriated to the use of the United States, but including nothing
                            by reason of the arrest and banishment complained of.</p>
                        <p>Joseph M. P. Nolan, No. 272, was arrested by the military provost-marshal
                            at Saint Louis, Mo., in October, 1861, on the charge of disloyalty to
                            the United States, and of having written a letter to an alleged enemy of
                            the United States in Canada, giving information as to military
                            movements. He was detained in prison at Saint Louis till June, 1862,
                            then transferred to the military prison at Alton, Ill., and there
                            detained till August, 1863, when he was finally discharged. His release
                            was offered him in December, 1861, and on one or two other occasions, on
                            his giving his parole to do no act unfriendly to the United States. This
                            parole he refused to give. Great and unnecessary hardships in connection
                            with his confinement were alleged on the part of the claimant; and the
                            proof conclusively showed that the prison in which he was confined at
                            Alton was wholly unfit in its appointments and sanitary <pb n="80"
                                xml:id="pg_80" facs="0136"/>condition for the confinement of
                            prisoners, especially for the large number there confined; and that at
                            times the treatment of the prisoners, including the claimant, was harsh
                            and cruel.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in favor of the claimant for $8,600, all the commission
                            joining. I am advised that the majority of the commission, at least,
                            held the original arrest of the claimant and his reasonable detention
                            justified; but that his long confinement and improper treatment during
                            it were not justified.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Mary Nolan, No. 273, the claimant alleged that she was
                            arrested at Saint Louis by a detective in the employ of the United
                            States authorities in September, 1864; taken before the provost-marshal
                            at Saint Louis, and committed by him to the Chestnut-street prison,
                            where she was detained for an entire day; and that she was there
                            subjected to improper treatment. She claimed damages $10,000. The
                            evidence in her case showed that she was brought before the
                            provost-marshal, apparently upon a subpoena, to testify in a case before
                            him; that she refused to testify, and defied and insulted the officer,
                            who committed her to the city prison, where she was detained for nine or
                            ten hours. Her allegations of improper treatment were not sustained. The
                            commission unanimously disallowed her claim.</p>
                        <p>In the case of John F. Parr, No. 285, the claimant, a resident of Nash
                            ville, Tenn., then in possession of the rebel forces, passed through the
                            lines into Indiana, and thence to Buffalo, N. Y., in October, 1861. He
                            went thence to New York City, where he bought some clothing, shoes,
                            medicines, and other goods, and returned thence to Buffalo, where he was
                            arrested immediately on his arrival, on the 20th of October; he was
                            taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, there confined for about
                            four months, and was finally discharged in February, 1862, without a
                            trial.</p>
                        <p>An award was made in his favor for $4,800, in which all the commissioners
                            joined. I am advised that the award proceeded on the ground that though
                            his original arrest and reasonable detention were lawful, his detention
                            for four months without trial was held not justified.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Richard Hall, No. 318, the claimant was arrested in
                            Maryland, on the 8th of March, 1864; was brought before a military
                            commission on the charge of having unlawfully passed from the loyal
                            States through the Federal and confederate military lines into the State
                            of Virginia, and there held illegal intercourse with the enemies of the
                            United States, and then returned through the lines in the same manner.
                            The military commission found him guilty of the offence charged, and
                            sentenced him to imprisonment in Fort McHenry, Maryland, for the term of
                            four months, and to pay a fine of $8,000, and to be imprisoned until the
                            fine should be paid. He was accordingly imprisoned for the four months,
                            and for twenty days thereafter, when he paid the $8,000 and was
                            released.</p>
                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was alleged that his visit to Virginia was
                            without unlawful intent and for innocent and social purposes. This
                            allegation was answered on the part of the United States by proof that
                            ‘the claimant took orders from the confederate military authorities at
                            Richmond for military supplies, which he undertook to purchase for them,
                            and that he returned through the lines with the purpose of executing
                            such orders. The counsel for the claimant claimed that the military
                            commission was without jurisdiction, citing the case of Milligan, (4
                            Wall., 2.) The counsel of the United States claimed that the offence was
                            purely a military one and cognizable by the military tribunals under the
                            Articles of War.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made an award in
                            favor of the claimant for $2,984. I am advised that this amount was made
                            up of the sum of $5,000, part of the fine of $6,000 imposed, which the
                            commission deemed excessive, reduced from United States currency in
                            which it was paid to gold, and interest added to make up the amount of
                            the award.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Llewellyn Crowther, No. 362, the claimant was arrested in
                            Baltimore in July, 1863, taken before Colonel Fish, then provost marshal
                            there, and detained in confinement at the Gil more House for about’
                            eight hours. The arrest grew out of a quarrel between the claimant and
                            two other persons at a hotel in Baltimore, of which complaint was made
                            to Colonel Fish, and the claimant was charged with using seditious and
                            disloyal language. He alleged that Colonel Fish, on the arraignment of
                            the claimant before him, used language abusively and indecently violent
                            toward him and toward his country and Queen. He claimed damages $10,000,
                            and the commission unanimously awarded him the sum of $100.</p>
                        <p>In the case of John M. Vernon, No. 364, the claimant alleged that he had
                            always been domiciled in England, the country of his nativity. It
                            appeared, however, that he had resided in the United States most of the
                            time since 1849, and had been there engaged in trade. He was in Europe
                            at the breaking out of the war, but returned to the United States in
                            June, 1861, and thence passed into the confederacy, remaining there,
                            with the exception of a temporary absence in the latter part of 1861,
                            till January, 1863.</p>
                        <p>He alleged that he had always maintained his neutrality between the
                            United States and the confederate government$ that in January, 1863, he
                            sailed from the port of Charleston in the steamer Huntress, owned by
                            himself and laden with cotton, principally owned by himself, for Nassau,
                            N. P.; succeeded in passing out through the blockade, but on the day
                            after his departure, and upon the high seas between Charleston and
                            Nassau, the steamer took fire and was destroyed, the claimant with the
                            master and crew escaping in two ship’s boats. These boats were picked up
                            by a <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0138"/>United States war-vessel on
                            the ocean, on the 18th January, and the claimant was carried to Hilton
                            Head, S. C., there transferred to another vessel, carried to New York,
                            examined before the United States marshal there, and committed to Fort
                            Lafayette, in New York Harbor, in which fort, and afterwards in Fort
                            Warren, Boston Harbor, he was kept confined till October, 1865, when he
                            was released upon his written pledge that he would “sail from Boston,
                            Mass., by the earliest opportunity, and leave the United States of
                            America, not to return without the special permission of the President
                            thereof.”</p>
                        <p>He alleged large losses resulting from his imprisonment, by the waste and
                            destruction of his property in the Southern States during his
                            imprisonment, and in consequence of his business being deprived of his
                            personal attention; and claimed damages, in all, to the amount of
                            £338,133.</p>
                        <p>The proofs on the part of the United States showed that, up to his
                            departure from Charleston, in July, 1863, he had been largely and
                            actively engaged in rendering aid to the confederate government in its
                            war against the United States; that he individually, and as a partner in
                            the firms of Vernon &amp; Co., and Vernon, James &amp; Co., had entered
                            into large contracts with the confederate government for the supply of
                            arms, ammunition, and military supplies, including twelve large rifled
                            cannon, and large quantities of gun-barrels; rifles, pistols, powder,
                            army clothing, shoes, blankets, &amp;c.; that he had been engaged in the
                            manufacture of arms during the war, at Wilmington, N. C., for the
                            benefit of the confederate government. At the time of his capture some
                            of his contracts were found upon him: these contracts also granting to
                            his firm, on the part of the confederate government, certain privileges
                            of purchasing cotton and tobacco, and transporting the same without
                            hindrance, and exporting them to all ports except those of the United
                            States, with convoy if desired. Correspondence ensued between Lord
                            Lyons, Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, and Mr. Seward, the
                            Secretary of State of the United States; and upon submission to Her
                            Majesty’s legation of the proofs found upon the person of the claimant
                            further intervention in his behalf was declined.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stuart, then Her Majesty’s acting minister at Washington, on the 23d
                            September, 1863, addressed to Mr. Vernon the following letter: <quote

                                    your letter of the 19th instant, that I lately received a
                                    dispatch from Earl Russell, stating that your case had been
                                    fully considered by Her Majesty’s government in communication
                                    with the law advisers of the Crown.</p>
                                <p>It appears to Her Majesty’s government, judging by the evidence
                                    produced, that you are a born British subject, and it does not
                                    appear that you have obtained naturalization in the United

                                    and that you were, when taken, actually engaged in rendering
                                    material assistance to the government of these States, although
                                    deriving a commercial profit from so doing, Her Majesty’s
                                    government are of opinion that the United States Government are
                                    justified in treating you as a <hi rend="italic">de fcato</hi>
                                    belligerent.</p>
                                <p>The evidence, moreover, shows that although, during as residence
                                    of twenty-three <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0139"/>years in
                                    the Southern States, you paid occasional visits to England, you
                                    had no intention of returning to permanent residence in your
                                    native country, and that, you were practically and <hi
                                        rend="italic">de facto</hi> a willing citizen of the
                                    Confederate States, engaged in equipping their army.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s government, therefore, consider, under the
                                    circumstances, your release cannot be claimed as a matter of
                                    right merely because you were born a British subject, but Earl
                                    Russell desires that Her Majesty’s legation should,
                                    nevertheless, endeavor to persuade the United States Government
                                    to mitigate or shorten your captivity.</p>
                                <p>I accordingly represented to the Secretary of State, on the 10th
                                    instant, that it would be a gratification to Her Majesty’s
                                    government to learn that your captivity had been mitigated or
                                    shortened through the clemency of the United States Government,
                                    and your case is consequently again under consideration.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>From that time forth Her Majesty’s government uniformly and consistently
                            declined any international interference for the protection of Mr.
                            Vernon, and disclaimed all pretence of right to intervene in his behalf.
                            Sir Frederick Bruce, then Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, as late
                            as 24th October, 1865, said in a letter to Mr. Vernon, in response to an
                            application from him: “My instructions prohibit my interfering in your
                            behalf.”</p>
                        <p>A labored argument was filed on behalf of the claimant, by which it was
                            contended that the imprisonment of the claimant without trial was
                            utterly unjustifiable; that it was prolonged in a manner never
                            contemplated by the British authorities; that while under restraint his
                            treatment was indefensible, and that the order of banishment from the
                            United States, and the subsequent refusal to revoke it, were outrages
                            against all law and justice. That the decision of Her Majesty’s
                            government, justifying the treatment of the claimant by the United
                            States Government as a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> belligerent, was
                            erroneous; that the condition of the claimant, at the time of his
                            capture, was that of a neutral alien engaged in commercial transactions
                            only with the confederate government, and that such transactions were
                            not criminal and did not deprive him of his neutral character. That even
                            if he had previously been an enemy by domicile., he had, when he
                            embarked from Charleston on the Huntress, left the country of his former
                            domicile without the intention of returning, and his native domicile,
                            native allegiance, and native <hi rend="italic">status</hi> had
                            thereupon instantly reverted to him, and that the decision of Her
                            Majesty’s government, justifying his detention by the United States, and
                            refusing to intervene in his behalf, could not be taken as prejudicing
                            the claimant’s individual right to reclamation under, the rules of
                            international law. The counsel for the claimant cited, in support of

                        <p>In the case of William B. Forwood, No. 394, the claimant, a British
                            subject, domiciled in England, in October, 1861, landed at New York from
                            the steamer City of Washington from Queenstown. He was arrested
                            immediately on landing from the steamer, on information that he had,
                            both in Liverpool and on board the steamer upon his passage, expressed
                            himself as a warm friend of the rebellion, and that he was connected
                            with a firm engaged in running the blockade and upon the suspicion that
                            his visit to New York was for the purpose of promoting correspondence
                            with the enemy. He was detained at the office of the chief of police in
                            New York for some three or four hours, his person and baggage examined,
                            and he was then discharged. He claimed, as damages for his arrest,
                            £5,000. The commission disallowed his claim, Mr. Commissioner Gurney
                            dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of Stephen Jarman, No. 418; Robert Bowden, No. 419; Samuel
                            Joseph Redgate, No. 420; and John Henry Ellsworth, No. 421; the
                            claimants were respectively the master and passengers on the British
                            steamship Peterhoff, captured as prize of war by the United States
                            steamer Vanderbilt, near the Island of St. Thomas, in February, 1863.
                            The case of the Peterhoff will be more fully reported under a subsequent
                            head. Bowden, Red gate, and Ellsworth were respectively in charge of
                            portions of the cargo of the Peterhoff, either as owners or consignees,
                            or as agents for owners or consignees. The Peterhoff was taken, on her
                            capture, first to Key West and thence to New York, where she was
                            libelled in the United States district court. Jarman, Bowden, and
                            Redgate were taken with the vessel to New York, and detained till their
                            depositions, <hi rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi>, were taken, when
                            they were discharged. Ellsworth was discharged at Key West, without
                            being taken to New York or examined as a witness. He was detained on
                            board the Peterhoff from her capture, 25th February, till the 25th
                            March, eighteen days after her arrival at Key West. Jarman, Bowden, and
                            Redgate were examined as witnesses in New York on the 1st day of April,
                            the fourth day after the arrival of the Peterhoff in New York <pb n="85"
                                xml:id="pg_85" facs="0141"/>Harbor, and were respectively discharged
                            immediately after their examination.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimants, respectively, it was contended that the
                            capture of the Peterhoff was unlawful, and the detention of these
                            claimants, respectively, was likewise unwarranted by prize law.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the Peterhoff was
                            rightfully captured on justifiable cause, and that the detention of
                            these claimants as witnesses was warranted by the law and practice of
                            the prize courts; and that as to Ellsworth, his release at Key West
                            without examination as a witnesss, and without being taken to New York
                            where the vessel was libelled, could not be considered as an aggravation
                            of his imprisonment, nor as giving him any right of reclamation, which
                            he would not have had if taken to New York and examined as a witness, as
                            he lawfully might have been.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                        <p>The case of Philip George Beaumont Dean, No. 465, was of like character
                            with the four last named. The claimant was captured on board the British
                            brig Dashing Wave, (whose case will be hereafter reported,) off the
                            mouth of the Rio Grande River, in November, 1863. He was rated as an
                            able seaman on the brig, though in fact a passenger and a son of one of
                            the owners of the brig. He was taken with the vessel to New Orleans,
                            where the vessel was libelled; was examined as a witness <hi
                                rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi> 28th November, 1863, six days
                            after the arrival of the vessel at New Orleans, and was then released.
                            His memorial alleged that from that time till the 23d July, 1864, he was
                            “detained on parole by the commissioners of the United States
                            Government” at New Orleans, but his evidence showed no such detention or
                            parole, and it appeared that his stay in New Orleans after his
                            examination was a voluntary one, for the purpose of looking after the
                            interests of the owners of the vessel, and cargo.</p>
                        <p>His claim was unanimously disallowed by the commission.</p>
                        <p>In the case of George F. Cauty, No. 443, the claimant was a British
                            subject, for several years domiciled in Central America, but from March
                            to December, 1863, temporarily resident in the city of New York,
                            engaged, as he alleged, in commercial enterprises connected with Central
                            America. He was arrested in New York by the United States military
                            authorities on the eve of his departure for Nicaragua by steamer, 24th
                            December, 1863; detained in a prison in the city of New York for three
                            days, then transferred to Fort Lafayette, and there confined till the
                            14th March, 1864, when he was discharged without trial and without
                            information of the grounds of his arrest, except the general statement
                            that he had been engaged in aiding the enemies of the United States, or
                            violating the neutrality laws and regulations. It appeared that he was
                            arrested in company with one Dr. Segur, in connection with whom he had
                            been <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0142"/>engaged in purchasing arms,
                            as was alleged by them, for the state of San Salvador, and that the
                            circumstances of the purchase and shipment of these arms were such as to
                            lead to the strong suspicion that they were in fact purchased and
                            shipped for the use of the confederate government. Shortly after his
                            arrest he was brought before a military commission at New York and
                            interrogated as to his connection with Dr. Segur, and purchase of arms
                            made by him. Most of these questions he refused to answer, on the ground
                            that he had “been advised not to compromise himself or his friends in
                            any shape or manner.” He was thereupon remanded to prison. The charge
                            that the arms were in any way designed to aid the enemies of the United
                            States was not sustained by the proofs. The claimant alleged large
                            pecuniary losses resulting from his imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>The commission made an award in his favor for $15,700, Mr. Commissioner

                        <p>John Tovell, No. 446, a Baptist clergyman, was arrested at Nashville,
                            Term., on the 9th November, 1862, on the charge of disloyalty to the
                            United States, and of having in the course of a funeral oration
                            delivered at Nashville used language strongly denunciatory of the
                            military authorities in charge of Nashville, and tending to incite
                            disaffection and rebellion. Nashville was a town within the
                            insurrectionary states, captured by the United States in the spring of
                            1862, and held by them as a military post and under military government
                            at the time of the claimant’s arrest. He was detained in prison till the
                            8th June, 1863, and then banished into the confederate lines.</p>

                            within a State not in rebellion, was arrested at that place by the
                            military authorities of the United States, in July, 1864, on a charge of
                            circulating treasonable documents, the documents in question being
                            copies of a handsomely printed placard highly laudatory of the
                            confederate General Robert E. Lee, as a patriot, Christian, and hero of

                            rebellion; and it was contended on the part of the United States that
                            the circulation of this document by Dr. Smith was made with the direct
                            purpose and intent of giving aid to the rebel “cause $ that it was
                            calculated to give such aid, and that his, imprisonment and detention

                        <p>Robert McKeown, No. 463, was in March, 1863, while employed as a

                            the gunboat Benton, on the Mississippi, River, near the mouth of the
                            Yazoo, arrested by the commanding officer of the gun-boat, confined in
                            the hold for about four days, then transferred to another gun-boat, and
                            taken to Cairo, Ill., where he was discharged on the 5th April, after a
                            confinement, in all, of thirteen days He alleged improper treatment
                            during his confinement, inconsequence of which his health was materially
                            injured. His arrest was upon the charge of disloyal and seditious

                            gunboat.</p>

                        <p>These claims related to vessels and their cargoes captured as prize by
                            the United States during the war, and libelled in the prize-courts of
                            the United States. In a portion of them final sentence of condemnation
                            of the vessel or cargo, or both, was given by the courts of the United
                            States, and the claim was now brought for the alleged value of such
                            vessels and cargoes, alleging the condemnation to have been wrongful. In
                            the other cases judgment of restitution was given by the courts, and the
                            claim was now brought for damages by reason of the alleged wrongful
                            capture and detention, and for costs and expenses incurred in respect of
                            the same.</p>
                        <p>The whole number of memorials filed by different claimants for such
                            captures was seventy-six, some of the memorials covering claims for
                            several different vessels, as in the case of Sanders &amp; Sons, No.
                            281, in which damages were claimed for the capture and condemnation of
                            twenty seven vessels.</p>
                        <p>The whole number of vessels captured, in respect of which and their
                            cargoes claims were interposed, was seventy, in some instances many
                            claims of different alleged owners being interposed in respect of the
                            same vessel and her cargo, as in the case of the Peterhoff, in regard to
                            which, and different portions of her cargo, twenty-two memorials were

                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>In respect of the remaining sixty-four, the claims were wholly
                            disallowed.</p>

                            addition of interest for the average time claimed, to $9,064,306.</p>
                        <p>The whole amount of the allowances, in respect of the six vessels as to
                            which awards were made, was $582,177.</p>

                        <p>The question was early raised, on the part of the United States, as to
                            the jurisdiction of these prize cases by the commission, both in respect
                            to cases where the decision of the ultimate appellate tribunal of the
                            United States had been had, and to those in which no appeal had been
                            prosecuted on the part of the claimants to such ultimate tribunal. As to
                            the former class of cases, the undersigned may properly state that he
                            personally entertained no doubt of the jurisdiction of the commission,
                            as an international tribunal, to review the decisions of the
                            prize-courts of the United States, where the patties alleging themselves
                            aggrieved had prosecuted their claims by appeal to the court of last
                            resort. As this jurisdiction, however, had been sometimes questioned, he
                            deemed it desirable that a formal adjudication by the commission should
                            be had upon this question. The commission unanimously sustained their
                            jurisdiction in this class of cases, and, as will be seen, all the
                            members of the commission at some time joined in awards against the
                            United States in such cases.</p>
                        <p>The question as to the jurisdiction of the commission in cases where the
                            party complaining had failed to prosecute his appeal from the prize
                            court of original jurisdiction to the court of ultimate appellate
                            jurisdiction, was raised by demurrer in several cases, and was argued at
                            length in the case of the British brig Napier, Ryerson and others,
                            claimants, No. 147. In that case the vessel was captured as prize in
                            July, 1862, by a United States vessel of war near the mouth of the Gape
                            Fear River, on which river is situated the port of Wilmington, in North
                            Carolina, a blockaded port. She had sailed from Turk’s Island, one of
                            the Bahamas, with a cargo of salt, on a voyage alleged to have been
                            destined for the port of Beaufort, N. C., then not blockaded, but in
                            possession of the United States forces. She was taken by the captors to
                            the port of Philadelphia, and there libelled in the United States
                            district court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, on the charge
                            of attempting and intending to violate the blockade of the port of
                            Wilmington, or other blockaded port in the insurrectionary States, and
                            was condemned by that court as lawful prize, and sold under the decree.
                            The vessel belonged to the port of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and was owned
                            by British subjects there resident. No appeal appeared to have been
                            taken from the decision of the district court by which the vessel was
                            condemned. The memorial contained a general averment that neither the
                            vessel nor cargo was “liable to confiscation” under the law of nations
                            or the laws of the United States. A demurrer was interposed on behalf of
                            the United States, specifying, among other grounds of demurrer, the
                            following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That the memorial does not show any appeal taken from the
                                    judgment of said court to the appellate tribunals of the United
                                    States having appellate jurisdiction thereof; and does not show
                                    that the remedy of the claimants for their alleged grievance
                                    under the laws of the United States had been sought or pursued
                                    to or in the judicial tribunal of the United States having
                                    ultimate appellate jurisdiction of the said matter.</p>

                        <p>On the argument of this case on demurrer, it was contended, on the part
                            of the United States, that until the claimant has exhausted his remedy
                            by appeal, and finds himself still aggrieved by the judicial tribunal of
                            last resort, he has no ground of reclamation against the United States
                            as the workers of injustice against him. That it is only in the event of
                            final failure of justice, after pursuit of all the regular and ordinary
                            means of redress, that any adjudication is to be considered as working
                            wrong against a foreign litigant so as to entitle him to reclamation
                            through the intervention of his own government. That the litigant who
                            stops short of this and submits to the judgment of the inferior court,
                            without seeking a review and reversal of such judgment by the appellate
                            tribunal, in effect concedes the correctness of the judgment to which he
                            submits. The counsel for the United States cited the report of Mr.
                            Murray, (afterwards Lord Mansfield,) 1753, upon the reprisals made by
                            the King of Prussia upon the Silesian Loan; Wheaton’s History of the Law
                            of Nations, pp. 210, 211; Wild man’s Institutes, vol. 1, pp. 353, 354;

                            Nicholl and Mr. Pinkney in the case of the Betsy, before the commission
                            under the seventh article of the treaty of 13th November, 1794, between
                            the United States and Great Britain. (Wheaton’s Life of Pinkney, pp. 193
                            to 276.)</p>
                        <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel, on behalf of the claimants in this and
                            other cases, maintained that the doctrines of the publicists in regard
                            to the necessity of a party aggrieved following out his complete remedy
                            in the appellate prize courts of the nation of whose acts he complained,
                            applied only to the question as to grounds of war and reprisals, and did
                            not apply to the question of jurisdiction by an international tribunal,
                            established by treaty, with the large powers and jurisdiction conferred
                            by the treaty upon this commission. That under the terms of the treaty
                            the commission had jurisdiction of all wrongful acts committed by the
                            authorities of the United States upon the persons or property of British
                            subjects; that the case of the claimant here was founded, not on an
                            alleged denial of justice, but on an act alleged to be in violation of
                            the law of nations, to wit, the wrongful capture of the claimant’s
                            vessel, which act had been adopted by the United States, whose armed
                            force committed the wrong, and of which wrongful act the United States
                            had received the benefit. He cited Dana’s Wheaton, § 292; Grotius, book
                            3, c. 2, §§ 4, 5; Wildman, vol. 1, p. 197; the treaty between the United
                            States and Great Britain of 1794, (8 Stat, at L., 121,) and the case of
                            the bark Jones, before the commission under the convention of 1853
                            between the United States and Great Britain. (Report of that commission,
                            p. 83.)</p>
                        <p>The commission held, in effect, that, under the treaty, they had
                            jurisdiction, notwithstanding the failure of the claimant to pursue his
                            remedy by appeal to the court of last resort; but that such failure on
                            his part would be considered conclusive against him, unless satisfactory
                            reasons <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0146"/>were given for the
                            omission to appeal. It was thereupon unanimously ordered by the
                            commission that the demurrers be overruled, but that the claimants, in
                            all the prize cases in which appeals had not been taken and pursued to
                            the court of last resort, should file with the commission their reasons
                            for such omissions or failures to take and prosecute such appeals.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently the claimants in this case filed an affidavit, assigning as
                            their reasons for not appealing from the decree of the district court
                            the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>1st. Because it was universally known in Philadelphia at the time
                                    said decree passed that appeals from the prize courts there by
                                    claimants were almost uniformly confirmed with costs. 2d. That
                                    public opinion there was in sympathy with such confirmations,
                                    under the suspicion that commercial men in this province (Nova
                                    Scotia) were in sympathy with the confederates. 3d. That the

                                    procure the necessary sureties without much inconvenience, nor
                                    to sustain further heavy costs, and the burden of loss added to
                                    injury, especially as we had already expended nearly $500 in
                                    counsel fees, agency, and travelling expenses connected with
                                    this seizure.</p>

                        <p>On the filing of these “reasons” the commission, without further
                            argument, held them insufficient to excuse the want of appeal, and
                            unanimously disallowed the claim. On the decision of the original
                            question Mr. Commissioner Frazer read an opinion which will be found in
                            the appendix, L.</p>
                        <p>Under the order for claimants in cases in which no appeal had been taken
                            to file their reasons for non-appeal, such reasons were filed and passed
                            upon in the following cases:</p>
                        <p>John W. Carmalt, No. 89, claimant for part of the cargo of the ship
                            Amelia, captured and condemned by the United States, alleged, as his
                            excuse for non-appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, that
                            the claimant, being then within the State of South Carolina, then at war
                            with the United States, was unable to communicate with counsel in
                            Philadelphia, where the vessel was libelled, or to take any measures for
                            prosecuting such appeal on account of the war then raging.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) held these reasons
                            sufficient; but subsequently, on the hearing on the merits, unanimously
                            disallowed the claimant’s claim, it appearing that he was at the time of
                            the alleged capture domiciled within the Confederate States, and his
                            property, therefore, liable to capture on the high seas as enemy’s
                            property.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the brig Ariel, R. M. Carson, claimant, No. 178, the
                            reason assigned for non-appeal was that the claimant had never been
                            aware, until the filing of the demurrer to his memorial before the
                            commission, “that there could have been any appeal from the decision of
                            the United States prize court that condemned the vessel and cargo.”</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim, on the ground of the
                            insufficiency of this reason.</p>

                        <p>In the case of the schooner Argonaut, Joseph B. Hey cock, administrator,
                            No. 263, and Frederick Wm. Ruggles, No. 264, Claimants, the reasons for
                            non-appeal assigned were that the counsel consulted by the claimants
                            advised them that there was no necessity for taking such appeal, unless
                            they intended to commence a suit in a civil court for damages, and that
                            such claims, arising during the war, would, without doubt, be ultimately
                            made the subject of arbitration, on which advice the claimants acted,
                            and so omitted to appeal.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim on the ground of the
                            insufficiency of the reasons.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of the brig Sarah Starr and the schooner Aigburth, Cowlam
                            Graveley, claimant, No. 292, the reasons assigned for non-appeal were
                            that the claimant had become impoverished by his losses during the war,
                            and the expenses of prosecuting his claims in the prize-court of
                            original jurisdiction, and was unable to incur further expense; and also
                            that he was advised that in the excited state of the country, and in
                            view of the tenor of other decisions of the Supreme Court of the United
                            States, he would not be likely to obtain impartial justice by such
                            appeal.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim for insufficiency of the
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the schooner Prince Leopold, Henry A. McLeod, claimant,
                            No. 306, the claimant assigned as reasons for his failure to appeal, his
                            poverty and consequent inability to meet the drafts of his proctor and
                            counsel in New York, and his expectation that his proctor would
                            prosecute the appeal at his own expense, of the failure of which
                            expectation he was not advised in season to secure the services of
                            another lawyer on those terms.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously held the reasons insufficient, and disallowed
                            the claims.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the M. S. Perry, otherwise known as the “Salvor,” John
                            McLennan, claimant, No. 370, the claimant alleged as reasons for
                            non-appeal that the case of the vessel was hurried through the
                            prize-court so rapidly that he, residing in Havana, had no opportunity
                            to interpose any claim or defense; that he was advised by letter from
                            Lord Lyons, Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, that he would have
                            full opportunity to defend, but that subsequently it appeared that the
                            vessel and cargo had been condemned and sold some days before this
                            letter was written, and that, though he attempted by correspondence to
                            secure a defence of his rights, all such efforts proved futile and
                            unavailing.</p>
                        <p>The commission accepted these reasons as sufficient, Mr. Commissioner
                            Frazer dissenting, and directed the case to be heard on its merits. On
                            final hearing the claim was disallowed, as will hereafter appear.</p>
                        <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0148"/>
                        <p>In the ease of the ship Will-o’-the-wisp, J. G. A. Creighton and others,
                            claimants, No. 378, the reasons assigned for non-appeal were, in
                            substance, that they did not know the case was appealable, and that they
                            supposed that their proper appeal was to their own government.</p>
                        <p>The reasons were held insufficient, and the claim disallowed, Mr.
                            Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the brig Minnie, Wm. H. Fisher, claimant, No. 379, the
                            reasons for non-appeal were substantially the same as alleged in the
                            case of the Ariel, No. 178, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim for the insufficiency of
                            the reasons.</p>
                        <p>In the case, of the schooner Adelso, Henry Horton, claimant, No. 437, the
                            claimant assigned as his reasons for non-appeal, his poverty and his
                            apprehensions of the danger of investing more money in law expenses.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously adjudged the reasons insufficient, and
                            disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>The above were the only cases in which the sufficiency of the reasons
                            assigned for non-appeal were specifically passed upon by the commission.
                            In several other cases reasons for non-appeal were filed, but were not
                            passed upon by the commission before the final disposition of the cases
                            upon the merits.</p>
                        <p>The action of the commission upon those cases, respectively, will appear
                            in the following notes, under the heads of the respective vessels.</p>
                        <p>It maybe stated generally, that although in two or three cases, as above
                            noted, the commission expressly held the excuse for non-appeal to be
                            sufficient to entertain jurisdiction of the claim upon the merits, and
                            although in other cases the commission did not expressly disallow the
                            claim on the ground of the insufficiency of the reasons for non-appeal,
                            no award was made against the United States in any case in which the
                            claimants had not pursued their remedy in the prize courts of the United
                            States by appeal to the court of last resort. I am advised that Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer was of opinion that nothing short of the misfeasance
                            or default of the capturing Government, by means of which an appeal was
                            prevented, was sufficient to excuse the failure to appeal, and that in
                            accordance with this view he held the reasons assigned in every case
                            before the ‘commission to be insufficient.</p>
                        <p>The following cases cover all the prize cases not disposed of by the
                            rulings of the commission on the question of non-appeal, as above
                            stated:</p>
                        <p>The steamship Dolphin; Richard Henry Eustice, No. 166, claimant for part
                            of cargo and for wages, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured by a United States war-vessel while on a <pb
                                n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0149"/>voyage from Liverpool, ostensibly
                            to Nassau, in the island of New Providence. She was taken into the port,
                            of Key West, and there libelled in the United States district court for
                            the southern district of Florida. A claim was interposed in that court
                            on behalf of William J. Grazebrooke, merchant of Liverpool, as the owner
                            of the vessel.</p>
                        <p>The memorial of the claimant here alleged that the prize court refused to
                            condemn the steamer as lawful prize, but she was, notwithstanding, with
                            her cargo, taken possession of by the United States Government, and no
                            part thereof ever returned to the owner. The proofs, however, showed
                            that the vessel and cargo were regularly condemned in the prize court,
                            and that no appeal was taken from the judgment of that court. Among her
                            cargo were found 46 cases containing 920 rifles, and 20 cases containing
                            2,240 cavalry swords, all entered upon her manifest under the name of
                                <hi rend="italic">hardware</hi>. The proofs before the prize court
                            satisfied Judge Marvin, before whom the trial was had, that the ultimate
                            destination of both vessel and cargo was Charleston or Wilmington, both
                            blockaded ports of the Confederate States; and he accordingly decreed
                            condemnation of both vessel and cargo as lawful prize. The proofs in the
                            prize court were not put in evidence before the commission, and the
                            claimant submitted his case upon his own deposition, taken on notice, in
                            the course of which he refused to answer various pertinent questions
                            propounded on cross-examination, touching his experience as a
                            blockade-runner, and his intentions in connection with the voyage of the
                            Dolphin.</p>
                        <p>No reasons for non-appeal were filed, the case having been disposed of on
                            the merits without waiting for such reasons.</p>
                        <p>The commission, without hearing any argument on the part of the United
                            States, unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>The brig Isabella Thompson; James McDaniel, No. 168, claimant for vessel;
                            Nehemiah K. Clements, No. 167, claimant for cargo.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured in June, 1863, by a United States cruiser on her
                            return voyage from Nassau, New Providence, to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
                            where she was owned, having been chartered by the owner, McDaniel, to
                            William Pryor &amp; Sons, of Halifax, agents of Sanders &amp; Sons, of
                            Nassau, for a voyage from Halifax to Nassau and back to Halifax. The
                            claimant Clements in his memorial alleged that the vessel was chartered
                            by himself. The claimant McDaniel in his memorial alleged that the
                            charter was to Messrs. Wm. Pryor &amp; Sons. The proofs in both cases
                            showed that the charter, although in form to Messrs. Pryor &amp; Sons,
                            was taken by them as the agents of and for the benefit of Messrs.
                            Sanders &amp; Sons. She was taken by the captors into the port of New
                            York and there libelled in the United States district court. Judgment of
                            restitution was rendered in that court, but without costs or damages to
                            the claimants. (Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 377.) From so much of the
                            decree as refused costs and damages the claimants respectively appealed
                                <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0150"/>to the Supreme Court of the
                            United States, where the judgment of the district court was affirmed,
                            the supreme court saying that a case of probable cause was clearly made
                            out, and expressing doubt whether the vessel and cargo should not have
                            been condemned by the court below on the evidence before it. The case in
                            the Supreme Court is reported under the name of "The Thompson,” (3
                            Wallace Supreme Court Reports, p. 155.) The evidence showed that the
                            vessel had arrived at Nassau from Halifax, and had discharged her
                            outward cargo. She then took on board a cargo of turpentine and cotton,
                            the product of the insurrectionary States, which she received in the
                            harbor from on board another vessel, the Argyle, which bad run the
                            blockade from Wilmington, N. C., with this cargo, which she discharged
                            directly upon the Isabella Thompson, having hauled alongside her.</p>
                        <p>The claimant Clements alleged in his memorial that he was the sole owner
                            of the cargo which was, purchased by him at Nassau; that he had made an
                            arrangement with Messrs. Martin &amp; Co., of Nassau, that they should
                            have one-half the cargo when they paid for the same, but that Martin
                            &amp; Co. had never paid for their half, but after the seizure and
                            redelivery of the cargo to the claimant, refused to pay for their
                            one-half, and the claimant thereby remained sole owner. In the course of
                            the litigation in the prize court this claimant had several times stated
                            on oath that one-half the cargo belonged to him and one-half to Messrs.
                            Martin &amp; Co. In his testimony before the commission he stated in
                            effect that the cargo was shipped by Messrs. Martin &amp; Co., on joint
                            account, and that after restoration to himself he settled with Martin
                            &amp;Co., he paying all expenses, and on such settlement it was agreed
                            that he should be personally entitled to all damages recovered from the
                            United States Government. Martin &amp; Co. were shown to have been
                            actively engaged in blockade-running; and their letters found on board
                            the Isabella Thompson, to their correspondents at Halifax and New York,
                            sufficiently indicated that the cargo in question was run out by the
                            Argyle on joint account of themselves and the claimant Clements.</p>
                        <p>On cross-examination Clements refused to answer who constituted the firm
                            of Martin &amp; Co., and whether he was himself a member of that firm;
                            whether they had general authority to make purchases for and shipments
                            to him, or only special authority for particular purchases; whether they
                            shipped goods on his account to the blockaded ports of the
                            insurrectionary States, or purchased goods in those ports for him. He
                            also refused to state more particularly the terms of the contract or
                            agreement by which he became the owner of Martin &amp; Co.’s half of the
                            cargo, and evaded the question whether he ever paid for the cargo seized
                            in the Isabella Thompson, and if so, to whom, how much, and when. He
                            admitted himself the owner of the Argyle, the blockade-runner from which
                            the Isabella Thompson received the cargo in question.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the proofs <pb
                                n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0151"/>before the prize court,
                            especially as supported by the testimony of the claimant Clements before
                            the commission, clearly established that as to the cargo there was not
                            only ample probable cause to justify the capture, but that the proof was
                            ample for its condemnation; that the cargo was never landed at Nassau,
                            and certainly never became a part of the common stock of that port, but
                            was in the course of-a continuous voyage from the blockaded port of
                            Wilmington to Halifax, having been merely trans-shipped from the Argyle
                            to the Isabella Thompson, without change of ownership or of original
                            destination. That the evasive, uncandid, and untruthful testimony of the
                            claimant Clements when testifying in his own behalf, and his refusal to
                            answer on cross-examination legitimate and pertinent questions, exposed
                            his claim to every possible implication against its merits. And that the
                            only error committed by the prize court was in adjudging restitution
                            instead of condemnation of the cargo. That if the seizure of the cargo
                            was justifiable, the seizure and detention of the vessel were also
                            justifiable to the same extent, and that her owner could sustain no
                            claim for damages where the cargo was liable to condemnation or probable
                            cause was found for its seizure, or that of any part of it.</p>

                            Somerville &amp; Co., London, captured by the United States vessels,

                            States officials, who sold it at a high price.” His memorial contained
                            no other allegations concerning the tobacco or its capture. On demurrer

                            vessel; Harvey &amp; Co., No. 214, claimant for the cargo.</p>
                        <p>The Pacifique was owned at Quebec, Canada East, where the claimant
                            Lemieux resided. She was chartered to the claimants Harvey &amp; Co. for
                            a round voyage from Saint John’s, Newfoundland, to a port in the West
                            Indies; thence to Cienfuegos, Cuba, and thence back to Saint John’s. She
                            sailed from Cienfuegos on the 12th March, 1863, on her alleged return
                            voyage to Newfoundland, upon which her proper course would have taken
                            her along the eastern shore of Florida. She was captured on the 27th
                            March, 1863, by a United States war-vessel, off the port of Saint
                            Mark’s, in the Gulf of Mexico, on the western shore of Florida, and <pb
                                n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0152"/>so near the blockaded ports of
                            Cedar Keys and Saint Mark’s as to raise what Judge Marvin called “a very
                            strong and violent presumption” in the mind of the capturing officer of
                            a purpose to break the blockade. She was taken into the port of Key
                            West, and there libelled in the United States district court. On the
                            hearing before Judge Marvin judgment of restitution of the vessel and
                            cargo was awarded on payment to the marshal of the pilotage and the
                            costs of keeping the vessel while in port, probable cause of capture
                            being certified by the judge, and costs and damages refused to the
                            claimants.</p>
                        <p>From this judgment no appeal was taken by either party; The evidence
                            before the prize court was not produced before the commission.</p>
                        <p>Under the order of the commission, requiring reasons for failure to
                            appeal to be filed, the claimants filed an affidavit of Mr. Outerbridge,
                            agent for the claimants Harvey &amp; Co., in which he assigned as the
                            reason for non-appeal that the master had no funds or credit at Key West
                            to employ counsel to take an appeal from said decree, or to furnish
                            bonds on appeal; that the master “believed that the release of the
                            vessel and cargo imposed on him the duty of continuing his voyage; “and
                            that he forthwith departed from Key West; and that “the claimants
                            believed that the payment of the costs imposed, as well as the
                            declaration of probable cause of capture, forming part of said decree,
                            were within the ordinary discretion of the court or its officers and
                            formed no ground of special exception.”</p>
                        <p>No distinct or separate ruling was made by the commission as to the
                            sufficiency of these reasons for non-appeal, the question having been
                            submitted on the final hearing of the case on its merits, and in
                            connection with the other questions involved in the case. Judge Marvin,
                            on the hearing, after examining the testimony and comparing the logbook,
                            came to the conclusion that, “strange as it might seem,” the case was
                            one of honest mistake of reckoning by the master, and that he, in fact,
                            thought he was on the eastern side of Florida, and had mistaken the
                            coast of Florida, which lay to the east of him, for a part of the
                            Bahamas, some five degrees of longitude farther to the east; that in
                            fact the vessel was innocent of any intent to break the blockade; but
                            that the circumstances under which the vessel was found fully justified
                            the capturing officer in making the capture, and warianted his belief
                            that the vessel was actually engaged in an attempt to break the
                            blockade.</p>

                                    proofs before the prize court, those proofs must be taken by the
                                    commission as sufficient to sustain the judgment of the prize
                                    court.</item>

                                <item>That on the evidence offered by the claimants themselves here,
                                    and on their letters to the British minister, and the protest of
                                    the master and officers of the schooner, the facts appearing
                                    fully sustained the conclusions arrived at by Judge Marvin. That
                                    under the circumstances <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0153"
                                    />appearing to the capturing officer, he was justified in making
                                    the capture and taking the vessel in for condemnation. That the
                                    capturing officer in such case did not stand in the place of a
                                    judicial officer, compelled to decide at his own peril upon the
                                    ultimate liability of a vessel to condemnation as prize, but was
                                    only bound to act honestly and fairly and upon the circumstances
                                    reasonably apparent to himself. That the fact that the vessel
                                    captured was involved in suspicious circumstances, without fault
                                    on the part of her officers, but by an honest mistake, did not
                                    change the question as to the liability of the captor to damages
                                    for wrongful seizure.</item>

                                <item>That the excuse offered for failure to appeal from the
                                    judgment of the prize court was insufficient. That the master
                                    had power to bind his principals (the owners) for payment of
                                    counsel-fees and for the security of the sureties on the appeal
                                    bond. That the statute regulating practice in the prize courts
                                    then in force (12 Stat, at Large, 760, sec. 7) gave full
                                    authority to the judge to extend the time for taking appeal; and
                                    that the claimants having made no application for such extension
                                    certainly could not allege that it would not have been granted
                                    on proper application. And that the second reason assigned for
                                    non-appeal amounted simply to an averment that the master, as
                                    representing the claimants, and the claimants themselves, on
                                    being advised by the master of the facts, did not consider that
                                    there was any just ground of appeal from the decree of the
                                    court.</item>

                            vessel out of her proper course solely from the ignorance and
                            bewilderment of her master, in consequence of thick weather and of the;

                            innocent of intent to break the blockade; that these facts were
                            established by her log and papers, and would have satisfactorily
                            appeared to the captors by a proper inspection of the same; that the
                            captors, having neglected to avail themselves of the knowledge thus open
                            to them from the books and papers of the vessel, were in fault, and
                            should have been cast in damages and costs; that no appeal could, by
                            law, be taken from the district court to the Supreme Court, the amount
                            involved being less than $2,000, and that, if an appeal could have been

                        <p>The bark Sally Magee; Charles Coleman, claimant, No. 232.</p>
                        <p>The memorial in this case was filed in the name of Charles Coleman, as
                            surviving partner of the firm of Charles Coleman &amp; Co., British
                            merchants, domiciled in Rio de Janeiro from 1861 to 1865, for a quantity
                            of coffee, part of the cargo of the bark Sally Magee, belonging to
                            Richmond, Va., and owned by citizens of the Confederate States there
                            resident. Coleman had in fact died about a week before the filing of the
                            memorial, that fact being unknown to the attorneys who filed the
                            memorial in his name, but for the benefit of the firm of Edmond,
                            Davenport &amp; Co., as hereinafter set forth. A question was raised as
                            to the case being regularly before the commission on account of the
                            death of the claimant before the filing of the memorial, but the
                            commission, in October, 1.872, ordered that the administrator of Coleman
                            have leave to prosecute the claim. The case was as follows:</p>
                        <p>Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., a firm doing business at Richmond, Va.? and
                            composed of citizens of that city, in 1861, before the establishment of
                            the blockade, shipped goods to the claimant’s firm at Rio de Janeiro,
                            with written instructions as to the investment of the proceeds in
                            coffee. These written instructions were not produced; but the claimants
                            gave evidence that the instructions were in effect to purchase coffee if
                            procurable, at not over 10½ cents per pound, and ship it to the Richmond
                            firm Coleman &amp; Co. purchased the coffee at a price not accurately
                            shown, but said to exceed the limit given them by the Richmond firm by
                            from one-half a cent to a cent per pound, and snipped it by the Sally
                            Magee, consigned to Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., at Richmond. The vessel
                            sailed from Rio de Janeiro for Richmond on the 12th May, 1861, and, as
                            the claimant alleged, before intelligence of the war or the blockade had
                            reached Rio de Janeiro. She was captured by a United States cruiser off
                            the entrance of Chesapeake Bay on the 26th June, 1861, taken to New
                            York, and there libelled in the United States district court, and the
                            vessel and cargo, including the coffee in question, condemned as enemy’s
                            property. (See report of the case in the district court, Blatchford’s
                            Prize Cases, 382.) In the prize court Messrs. Charles M. Fry &amp; Co.
                            intervened on behalf of Coleman &amp; Co., in respect of the coffee in
                            question, claiming it as the property of <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99"
                                facs="0155"/>Coleman &amp; Co. No express repudiation of the
                            purchase by the Richmond firm was shown; nor did it appear that the
                            Richmond firm was advised of the terms of the purchase until after the
                            capture of the vessel. Two members of that firm were examined as
                            witnesses before the commission, one of whom testified that, in view of
                            all the circumstances, he thought his firm would have ratified the
                            purchase if the vessel had arrived safely at her point of destination,
                            while the other testified that he thought they would not have ratified
                            it. Coleman &amp; Co. appealed from the decree of condemnation of the
                            district court to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the
                            decree of the district court was affirmed, (3 Wall., 451.) The
                            condemnation in the district court and the affirmation of the same in
                            the Supreme Court both proceeded upon the ground that the coffee was, by
                            the terms of the consignment, <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> the
                            property of the consignees, and that no sufficient proof had been made
                            of the terms of the instructions given by the Richmond firm to Coleman
                            &amp; Co. in regard to the purchase, or of the violation of those
                            instructions by Coleman &amp; Co. The claim was prosecuted before the
                            commission by Messrs. Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., at their own cost and
                            for their own benefit, though in the name of Charles Coleman, surviving
                            partner, under an assignment conveying to the former firm all the right,
                            title, and interest of Coleman &amp; Co. in the claim.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States, it was contended that the condemnation
                            by the prize court was lawful, and was sustained by the evidence before
                            that court; that no sufficient proof was there made to rebut the
                            presumption arising upon the face of the papers, that the coffee was the
                            property of the Richmond consignees; that if the facts were as alleged,
                            Coleman &amp; Co. were bound to make lawful proof of those facts before
                            the prize court; that for that purpose they should properly have applied
                            for the taking of further proofs, but that they made no such
                            application. That having failed to make such proofs before the prize
                            court, they could not now be allowed to make them <hi rend="italic">de
                                novo</hi> before the commission thus establishing a state of facts
                            different from that appearing before the prize courts. That even if such
                            new proof before the commission were admissible, the claimant, by
                            omitting to produce or account for the written instructions to Coleman
                            &amp; Co., had failed to establish even here any facts showing Coleman
                            &amp; Co. the owners of the coffee. That the parol evidence as to the
                            terms of those instructions given on the part of the claimant was
                            inadmissible, and that the claim being now prosecuted for the sole
                            benefit of Messrs. Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., who were not British
                            subjects, but at the time of the seizure enemies of the United States,
                            and now citizens of the same, the court had no jurisdiction of the claim
                            under the terms of the treaty. That the property having been captured
                            and condemned, as the property of Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co., enemies
                            of the United States; having been bought with their money for their
                            benefit; shipped to them in good faith; captured under circumstances
                            which made the capture lawful if <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0156"
                            />the property was theirs: they having attempted to avail themselves of
                            a technical right to repudiate the ownership of the property, and then
                            having taken an assignment of the claim for the purpose of reimbursing
                            themselves for the moneys invested on their behalf in the same property,
                            and now prosecuting the claim in the name of a British subject wholly
                            without actual interest in the property, the case was in substance one
                            between the United States and its own now citizens and former enemies,
                            and not covered by the spirit or equity of the treaty, and was not such
                            a <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> controversy between a subject of
                            Great Britain and the government of the United States as the treaty
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the production of the
                            written instructions to Coleman &amp; Co. was sufficiently excused, and
                            parol evidence of their contents was therefore properly admitted. That
                            such proof might properly be made before the commission, though not made
                            in the prize court. That Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co. as assignees of
                            Coleman, though citizens of the United States, were entitled to a
                            standing before the commission, and <hi rend="italic">quoad</hi> this
                            claim were to be deemed British subjects, and that the claim might
                            properly be prosecuted here by Edmond, Davenport &amp; Co. as assignees
                            of Coleman.</p>

                        <p>This case and the three following cases, of the Dashing Wave, the Volant,
                            and the Science, were intimately connected in character and
                            circumstances, and were argued and submitted together. The Sir William
                            Peel was captured by a United States war-vessel on the 11th September,
                            1863, while lying at anchor at the mouth of the Bio Grande, the stream
                            dividing the territories of the United States from those of Mexico, and
                            upon which, about forty miles from its mouth, lay on the right bank the
                            Mexican port of Matamoras, and on the left bank the United States port
                            of Brownsville, then in possession of the confederate forces. The place
                            at which she lay was held by the United States prize courts to be within
                            Mexican and neutral waters. She was taken by the captors into the port
                            of New Orleans, there libelled in the district court of the United
                            States, and on the 6th June, 1864, a decree of restitution was rendered
                            in that court, certifying reasonable cause of seizure, and providing
                            that the question as to costs and expenses be reserved for further
                            action.” Prom this decree the United States appealed to the Supreme
                            Court. Subsequently, on the hearing in the district court <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0157"/>of the question thus reserved, the
                            following decree was made on the 3d June 1865.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>On the preliminary trial of this cause, considering that the position
                                of the Sir William Peel, when captured, was a matter of doubt, and
                                with a view to set this question at rest, the court allowed the
                                captors further proof, and extended to the claimants the same
                                privilege if they chose to accept it.</p>
                            <p>The result of the whole testimony satisfied the mind of the court
                                that the Sir William Peel was captured when anchored south of the
                                line dividing the waters of the Rio Grande, and when, therefore, she
                                was in neutral waters. On that ground the court decreed her
                                restitution; but entertaining grave doubts as to the object of her
                                voyage, so grave, indeed, that but for this consideration, that she
                                was captured in neutral waters, the court should have decreed her
                                condemnation, it is now ordered and decreed that the costs and
                                charges consequent upon the capture be paid by the claimants, and
                                that damages be refused.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>From this decree the claimants appealed to the Supreme Court of the
                            United States. Both appeals were heard together in the Supreme Court,
                            and that court affirmed the judgment of restitution, including its
                            cerficate of reasonable cause of seizure, rendered June 6, 1864, and
                            reversed the decree of 3d June, 1865, charging the claimants with costs,
                            and remanded the case to the district court, with directions that no
                            costs or expenses be allowed to either party as against the other. The
                            case in the Supreme Court is reported in 5 Wallace, pages 517 to 536.
                            The opinion of that Court delivered by Chief Justice Chase is as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Regularly in cases of prize no evidence is admissible on the

                                    the hearing took place on the proper proofs.</p>
                                <p>Upon that hearing an order for further proof was made, allowing
                                    the libellants and captors on the one side, and the claimants on
                                    the other, to put in additional evidence; and such evidence was
                                    put in accordingly on both sides.</p>
                                <p>The preparatory evidence on the first hearing consisted of the
                                    depositions of the master of the ship, the mate, and one seaman.
                                    No papers were produced, for none were found on board; a
                                    circumstance explained by the statement of the master, that all
                                    the papers belonging to the vessel, except the lighter-men’s
                                    receipts for the cargo, were with the English consul and the
                                    consignees of the ship at Matamoras.</p>
                                <p>The depositions established the neutral ownership of the ship and
                                    cargo. They proved that the Sir William Peel was a British
                                    merchantman; that she had brought a general cargo, no part of
                                    which was contraband, from Liverpool to Matamoras; that this
                                    cargo, except an inconsiderable portion, had been delivered to
                                    the consignee at the latter port; that the cotton found on board
                                    was part of her return cargo; that it was owned by neutrals, and
                                    had a neutral destination; and that the ship, when captured, was
                                    in Mexican waters, well south of the boundary between Mexico and
                                    Texas.</p>
                                <p>This proof clearly required restitution. The order for further
                                    proof was probably made upon the rejected depositions, which,
                                    though inadmissible as evidence for condemnation, may have been
                                    allowed to be used as affidavits on the motion for the
                                    order.</p>
                                <p>The further proof, when taken, was conflicting.</p>
                                <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0158"/>
                                <p>The weight of evidence, we think, put the vessel, at the time of
                                    capture, in Mexican waters; hut if the ship or cargo was enemy
                                    property, or either was otherwise liable, to condemnation, that
                                    circumstance by itself would not avail the claim<gap
                                        quantity="1" unit="characters"/>ts in a prize court. It
                                    might constitute a ground of claim by the neutral power, those
                                    territory had suffered trespass, for apology or indemnity. But
                                    neither an enemy, nor a neutral acting the part of an enemy, can
                                    demand restitution of captured property on the sole ground of
                                    capture in neutral waters.</p>
                                <p>We must therefore look further into the case.</p>
                                <p>There is some evidence which justifies suspicion. Several
                                    witnesses state facts which tend to prove that the Peel was in
                                    the employment of the rebel government, and that part, at least,
                                    of the cotton laden upon her as return cargo was in fact rebel
                                    property.</p>
                                <p>There are statements, on the other hand, which make it probable
                                    that the Peel was in truth what she professed to be, a
                                    merchant-steamer, belonging to neutral merchants, and nothing
                                    more; that her cargo was consigned in good faith by neutral
                                    owners for sale at Matamoras, or to be conveyed across the river
                                    and sold in Texas, as it might lawfully be, not being
                                    contraband; that the cotton was purchased by neutrals and on
                                    neutral account, with the proceeds of the cargo or other
                                    money.</p>
                                <p>In this conflict of evidence we do not think ourselves warranted
                                    in condemning, or in quite excusing, the vessel or her cargo. We
                                    shall, therefore, affirm the decree by the district court, and
                                    direct restitution, without costs or expenses to either party as
                                    against the other.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This opinion sufficiently states the facts of the case as appearing by
                            the evidence in the prize court, and those facts were not substantially
                            changed by any evidence taken before the commission.</p>
                        <p>The claim before the commission was prosecuted by Edwin Gerard as
                            assignee of the owners of the vessel and cargo, and as attorney-in-fact
                            for the insurers and underwriters, some one hundred and fifty in number.
                            The vessel and cargo were fully insured against capture as well as other
                            losses; and upon the capture the owners abandoned vessel and cargo to
                            the underwriters, who accepted the abandonment and paid as for a total
                            loss. Pending the case in the district court, forty bales of cotton,
                            part of the cargo, were sold by order of the court, and the proceeds
                            paid into the registry of the court. And, pending the case on appeal in
                            the Supreme Court, the vessel, her tackle, stores, &amp;c, and the
                            remainder of her cargo, having been appraised at the sum of $857,642,
                            United States currency, were, by order of the court, delivered to the
                            claimants on their furnishing stipulations in the said appraised value
                            with security. The claimants claimed the sum of £35,314.16.9, the sum of
                            the amounts paid by the insurers to the assured less the net salvage
                            obtained by the sale of the vessel and cargo, and the further sum of
                            $369,000, demurrage from the 11th September, 1863, to the 15th
                            September, 1864, besides interest on both said sums.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimant filed, in No. 391, a general argument
                            applicable to the cases of the Sir William Peel, the Dashing Wave, the
                            Volant, the Science, and the Geziena Heligonda. In this argument he
                            maintained that the Rio Grande being the common boundary between Mexico
                            at peace and Texas at war with the United States, and the navigation of
                            the river being, by the law of nations as well as by the treaty of
                            Guadalupe Hidalgo, free and common to the citizens of both republics,
                            the <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0159"/>United States could not
                            lawfully blockade that river so as to interfere with the free ingress
                            and egress of neutral vessels engaged in trade with Matamoras, or with
                            the right of such vessels to lie at anchor in the roadstead at the mouth
                            of the Rio Grande, while engaged in lawfully discharging or receiving
                            cargoes on neutral account through the custom-house at Matamoras, or so
                            as to interfere with inland trade carried on across the Rio Grande, from
                            Mexico to Texas or from Texas to Mexico. That the British trade with
                            Matamoras was a legitimate trade according to established principles of
                            public law. That these doctrines were fully recognized by the Supreme
                            Court of the United States in the case of the Peter, hoff, (5 Wallace,
                            p. 28;) and by the courts of the United States in other cases, notably
                            that of the Labuan in the district court of the southern district of New
                            York. That it had also been fully recognized by the Secretary of State
                            of the United States, in the diplomatic correspondence with the British
                            legation, concerning the cases of the Labuan, the Magicienne, the
                            Peterhoff, the Sir William Peel, and other cases; and by the legislative
                            authorities of the same in appropriations for payment of the awards in
                            the cases of the Labuan, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>That, notwithstanding the recognition by the courts and executive and
                            legislative authorities of the United States of these principles, in
                            practice they had been disregarded, and British merchant-vessels,
                            whether found on the high seas and destined to the mouth of the Rio
                            Grande, with cargoes consigned to Matamoras, or anchored off the mouth
                            of the river and engaged in good faith in the discharge of neutral
                            cargoes for Matamoras, and in taking on board cargoes purchased at that
                            port on neutral account, had been subjected to capture and adjudication
                            as maritime prize.</p>
                        <p>That these captures had been the subject of earnest but temperate
                            remonstrance on the part of Her Majesty’s government, and were regarded
                            as violations of the just maritime rights of Great Britain, and as
                            assumptions of belligerent power not warranted by the law of
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>That the claims arising out of these captures were among the most
                            important in the contemplation of Her Majesty’s government in the
                            establishment of the Joint High Commission, and by that commission, in
                            the provisions of articles 12 to 17 of the treaty providing for the
                            establishment and conduct of this commission. That this commission had
                            full jurisdiction of the claims in question, and to review and overrule
                            the final judgments of the prize courts of last resort of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>That by the terms of the treaty, and of the “solemn declaration"
                            subscribed by the commissioners pursuant to the provisions of the
                            treaty, they were to decide each and all of the claims “according to
                            justice and equity.” That this provision gave to the present commission
                            a broader and more comprehensive power than was given by the 7th article
                            of the treaty of 1794 between the United States and Great Britain (8
                            Stat, at L., 121) to the commission provided for by that article, which
                            was required to decide the claims referred to it according to “justice,
                            equity, and the laws of nations.” That the omission of the last-named
                            element <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0160"/>of the prescribed rule
                            of conduct from the present treaty was significant. That under the
                            present treaty the judgments of the American prize tribunals were to be
                            tested in each case by this commission according to the principles of
                            “justice and equity” only. That “whether the law of nations justifies
                            those decisions or not, unless they are <hi rend="italic">also</hi>
                            justified in the conscientious judgment of the commissioners by justice
                            and equity, the compensation which they fail to give must be awarded to
                            the parties.” That “the inquiry is not limited to the question whether
                            the law of nations entitled the claimants to compensation, but extends
                            beyond that narrow range, and its broad scope is whether the parties are
                            equitably entitled, under all the circumstances surrounding the cases,
                            to receive indemnification for their losses.” That it was the intention
                            of the framers of the treaty to confer upon this commission “a more
                            extensive jurisdiction, and greater power to do justice than was
                            exercisable by the prize courts of the United States deciding according
                            to the law of nations.” That the technical rule of the prize courts,
                            that “probable cause “not merely excuses, but in some cases justifies, a
                            capture, is a hard rule, “admitted to be opposed to the fundamental
                            ideas of justice and equity,” and “only to be justified upon grounds
                            which justify the extreme severity of the other operations of war.” That
                            therefore this commission was not bound to refuse damages in cases of
                            restitution to the claimants, even “if they should think that the
                            appellate prize court was warranted in its decision that there existed,
                            in the sense of the prize law, probable cause of capture.”</p>
                        <p>That if, however, it should be held that the only inquiry to be
                            instituted by the commission in such cases is, “whether there were such
                            reasonable-grounds of suspicion as constitute what is technically called
                            probable cause of capture,” the commissioners should nevertheless
                            adjudicate according to their own judgment of the facts and the law
                            constituting the foundation of probable cause, “unembarrassed by the
                            special and technical rules of the prize code.” That though the
                            commission is not therefore bound by the principles held by the prize
                            courts in their adjudications, but has a larger and more equitable
                            jurisdiction, yet the decisions of prize courts of the highest authority
                            have established the duty of condemning captors in costs and damages
                            where they have unjustly interfered with the operation of lawful neutral
                            commerce. In this connection the counsel cited the cases of the
                            Elizabeth, 1 Acton, 10; the Ostsee, 9 Moore’s P. C. R., 150; the

                        <p>In answer to these propositions in the general argument the counsel for
                            the United States fully admitted the propositions as held and recognized
                            by the judicial, executive, and legislative authorities of the United
                            States, that the <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> trade with Matamoras
                            was a legitimate trade; that the United States could not lawfully
                            blockade the mouth of the Bio Grande or the port of Matamoras, or any
                            other Mexican port, nor interfere with the legitimate ingress or egress
                            of neutral vessels engaged in trade with Matamoras, or with the right of
                            such vessels to lie <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0161"/>at anchor
                            in the roadstead at the month of the Rio Grande while engaged in the <hi
                                rend="italic">bona fide</hi> discharge or receiving of neutral
                            cargoes for or from that port.</p>
                        <p>He denied that in practice the United States had violated these
                            principles or undertaken to assert rights inconsistent with them, but
                            maintained that, on the contrary, the State Department of the United
                            States, in its diplomatic correspondence, had recognized their validity;
                            insisting only that the question of the application of these principles
                            to the facts of each particular case was to be determined by the regular
                            prize tribunals, which might be safely trusted to do entire justice in
                            every case.</p>
                        <p>That the decisions of those courts in the various cases referred to by
                            the counsel for the claimant, fully recognized those principles and
                            applied them to the facts appearing in each case; and that in the
                            disposition not only of those cases, but generally of all the prize
                            cases arising during the war, those courts had carefully adhered to the
                            principles of international law as recognized in the prize courts of all
                            civilized countries, and had extended to neutral vessels and cargoes a
                            degree of projection, to say the least, quite as ample and complete as
                            that afforded by the prize courts of Great Britain, under the learned
                            and widely known and recognized decisions of Sir William Scott and his
                            successors in those courts.</p>
                        <p>He admitted fully the jurisdiction of the commission, and their power and
                            duty under the treaty to review the final judgments of the prize courts
                            of ultimate resort of the respective nations, as not conclusive upon the
                            respective governments, which might intervene on behalf of their
                            subjects against the judgments of those courts, such jurisdiction having
                            been long since fully established by the direct decision of the
                            commission upon that question, and not having since been disputed.</p>
                        <p>As to the rules and principles by which the commission were to be
                            governed in their decisions upon these cases, he maintained that the
                            rule prescribed by the treaty, that the commissioners should
                            “impartially and carefully examine and decide to the best of their
                            judgment, and according to justice and equity,” had in no respect
                            abolished or changed those well-settled principles, in accordance with
                            which the tribunals of the civilized world have been accustomed to
                            decide upon the validity of captures and the respective rights of
                            belligerents and neutrals in relation to them. That “justice and equity”
                            were not to be attained by a disregard of judicial precedents and
                            established principles of judicial proceeding.</p>
                        <p>That to adopt the doctrine propounded by the counsel for the claimant was
                            to substitute the mere fancy or caprice of a tribunal acting without
                            guidance or authority, for those sound rules established and followed by
                            judicial tribunals, in the light of the learning and experience of ages,
                            for the very furtherance of “justice and equity.” That true “justice and
                            equity” are recognized by all judicial tribunals, municipal or
                            international, as attainable only by well-defined and settled rules and
                            principles <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0162"/>of general
                            application. That if this idea is lost sight of, substantial justice as
                            well as substantial equity is at an end; and the rights of parties are
                            committed to the absolute and uncontrolled will and caprice of the
                            judicial officer, instead of the protection of the law.</p>
                        <p>That while, therefore, the right of the commission to sit in judgment
                            upon the validity and correctness of the judgments of the prize courts
                            of the United States upon these cases is not now questioned; such
                            validity and correctness are to be determined only in accordance with
                            the settled principles of prize law, as recognized by the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>That in reviewing the judgments of the highest appellate courts of either
                            of the two countries, high contracting parties to the treaty, the high
                            reputation of those courts respectively, the weight uniformly given to
                            the decisions of each by the other, and the rules of international
                            comity and mutual respect, dictate that such judgments are not to be
                            rashly or hastily overruled or reversed; but only on a clear showing of
                            a violation of the rules of international law <hi rend="italic">in re
                                minime dubia</hi>. That the question to be decided in these cases is
                            whether injustice has been done to the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty
                            by the judicial tribunals of the United States; and that the commission
                            certainly cannot find that such injustice has been done, unless they
                            find that the well-settled principles of international law have been
                            violated by those tribunals.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the proposition of the claimant’s counsel, that the rule of
                            the prize courts disallowing damages to the claimant where “probable
                            cause" appears for the capture, is one of extreme severity as against
                            the neutral trader, “opposed to the fundamental ideas of justice and
                            equity,” and “a hard rule, admitted to be such by all writers on the law
                            of nations,” the counsel for the United States cited the language of Dr.
                            Lushington, in the case of the Leucade, (2 Spinks, 236,) as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Lord Stowell administered the prize law on great and
                                    comprehensive principles. His object was that, on the whole,
                                    equal justice should be done to the rights of the belligerent
                                    and the just claims of neutral nations; but he did not seek in
                                    each particular case to do the most perfect justice. Many
                                    passages in his judgments might be cited to show this; whereby
                                    he declared that, though there might be hardships in particular
                                    cases, both to captors and especially neutrals, yet, on the
                                    whole, the balance was in favor of the neutral rather than
                                    against him. Lord Stowell used so say, though blockade was a
                                    hardship on a neutral, and the right of search was a hardship on
                                    a neutral, yet it was to be recollected the whole trade was
                                    always open to them—the carrying trade in time of war. He used
                                    always to say, and rely greatly on that rule of law, that, in
                                    the first instance, the case should be heard on the evidence of
                                    the claimants themselves, namely, the ship’s papers and
                                    depositions.</p>
                                <p>In the case of the Diligentia, (1 Dods., 404,) where the captors
                                    complained of what Lord Stowell was about to do, Lord Stowell
                                    made the same answer; he told them, though they might complain
                                    in particular instances, yet he must adhere to the general
                                    principle, though the consequences might press hard upon them.
                                    Now, no person more readily acknowledged the truth of the
                                    principle, that a claimant should be indemnified for a capture
                                    made without probable cause, than Lord Stowell; no one more
                                    powerfully manifested it; but that will necessarily presuppose
                                    that the court is in possession of the truth.</p>
                                <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0163"/>
                                <p>It is equally contrary to common justice that a captor should be
                                    mulcted in costs and damages where he has faithfully performed
                                    his duty, and had, in truth, adequate cause for the seizure. Yet
                                    this cause of seizure might not appear on the face of the
                                    depositions and ship’s papers. So it might be in blockade cases,
                                    and in numerous others which might be stated.</p>

                                <item>That the vessel and cargo not having been charged with costs
                                    under the final decree of the Supreme Court, the only question
                                    before the commission was as to the right of the owners to
                                    damages; that the claimants were in no position to make such
                                    claim before the commission; that any right to damages in the
                                    prize courts was barred by the first decree of the district
                                    court of 6th June, 1864, which adjudged reasonable cause of
                                    seizure, and that from this decree or from any part of it the
                                    claimants had never appealed; that the question as to costs and
                                    expenses” reserved by that decree was plainly the question only
                                    whether costs and expenses should be allowed against the
                                    claimants, their right to claim costs and expenses against the
                                    captors being barred by the certificate of “reasonable cause of
                                    seizure” contained in the same decree; that the claimants,
                                    having failed to appeal from so much of this decree as certified
                                    reasonable cause of seizure, must be considered, in the language
                                    of the letter of Sir William Scott and Dr. Nicholl to Mr Jay, (3
                                    Phillimore, 554,) to have “acknowledged the justice of the
                                    sentence in that respect,” and that within the rule of practice
                                    already settled by the commission the claimants, having neither
                                    appealed nor rendered any reason for not having appealed, their
                                    claim must be disallowed; that the only effect of the second
                                    decree of the district court of 3d June, 1865, from which the
                                    claimants did appeal, was to charge the claimants with the costs
                                    and charges of the captors, and that on their appeal from this
                                    decree they had had full relief by the judgment of the Supreme
                                    Court; that it had never been possible for the Supreme Court to
                                    award damages in favor of the claimant had they been so
                                    disposed, such damages being barred by the certificate of
                                    probable cause in the first decree of 6th June, 1864, from which
                                    the claimants had not appealed; that the claimants had therefore
                                    no standing before the commission to claim damages.</item>

                                    power whose waters had been violated that had cause of
                                    complaint; and such power only could be hard to raise the
                                    question of violation of her waters. That if the United States
                                    by this capture had violated any rights of Mexico, that was a
                                    question to be settled between the United States and Mexico.
                                    That so far as the questions between these claimants and the
                                    United States were concerned, the case stood in all respects the
                                    same as if the vessel had been captured upon the high
                                    seas.</item>

                                    irrespective of the question of the illegality of the contract
                                    of insurance, the contract being an executed one by the
                                    voluntary act of the parties. That these insurers were not to be
                                    taken as parties to the memorial, which was that of Mr. Gerard.
                                    That Gerard himself had derived by his assignment from the
                                    owners no title, their claims having vested in the insurers. And
                                    that if the assignment to him would otherwise have conveyed any
                                    interest, it was void as a champertous contract by which Gerard,
                                    an attorney, without any previous interest in the transaction,
                                    had purchased the claim as a matter of speculation and for the
                                    purpose of its prosecution against the United States. That by
                                    the law of England, the purchase of a chose in action by an
                                    attorney for the purpose of prosecution was illegal; that the
                                    same rule prevailed in most, if not all, of the United States;
                                    and that in practice it ought to prevail in international law.
                                    That such champertous purchases of claims, void by the common
                                    law of both countries, should not be recognized as lawful
                                    transactions, or be permitted as the basis of claims to be

                                    assured were deliberate contracts to indemnify British subjects

                                    rights of the United States; that such contracts, when sought to
                                    be enforced in the courts of the United States, would be held
                                    void by those courts; that like contracts, in relation to

                                    if prosecuted in the courts of that kingdom, would be held void
                                    by her courts; that, therefore, in an international tribunal

                                    such claims. That <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0165"/>these
                                    contracts of insurance were distinguishable from “war risks”

                                    and such as were discussed among the American claims before the
                                    tribunal at Geneva; those were assurances of the
                                    merchant-vessels of a belligerent against capture by their
                                    enemy, and such as are recognized in all wars of maritime
                                    nations as a permissible and necessary means to the preservation
                                    of any commerce whatever to a belligerent; but these are del
                                    itinerate contracts to indemnify a neutral who, by carefully
                                    excluding the “free from capture” clause, admits that he is
                                    engaged in an attempt to violate the belligerent rights of a
                                    friendly nation. That though the violation of blockade by a
                                    neutral is not held by international law to be strictly a crime,
                                    it is an unfriendly act, prejudicial to the character and
                                    interests of the neutral government of which the violator is a
                                    citizen, and to her honest and legitimate traders, and
                                    calculated to promote discord and hostility between friendly
                                    nations. That a contract to indemnify the citizen of a neutral

                                    act against a friendly government, should never be made a ground
                                    of reclamation by the government of the wrong-doer against the

                                    such governments.</item>

                        <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended in answer that the Supreme
                            Court of the United States had in effect passed upon all the questions
                            involved in the prize court, and had finally adjudged that the claimants
                            should not have damages against the captors; and had determined that the
                            fact of the capture having taken place in the waters of Mexico, a
                            neutral and friendly nation, did not make the capture a wrongful one as
                            between the captors and the claimants, Mexico not having intervened.
                            That on the proofs in the case there were no such circumstances of
                            suspicion as to afford probable cause of capture within the doctrines of
                            the prize courts. That if such probable cause within the rules of those
                            courts existed, it was plain, from the proofs before the commission,
                            that actual injustice had been done to the owners of the vessel and
                            cargo; that the vessel was engaged in a legitimate commerce; and that,
                            according to justice and equity, the claimants should be reimbursed for
                            the losses in consequence of the capture ultimately adjudged a wrongful
                            one, even though the capture were held excused by the doctrine of
                            probable cause under prize law. That the capture of the vessel within
                            the neutral waters of Mexico was in violation of international law, and
                            absolutely illegal and void. That the doctrines of the prize courts that
                            such a capture could only be questioned by the government whose
                            territory had been violated, applied only to the case of an enemy ship
                            captured in neutral waters and not to the case of a neutral vessel so
                            captured. That, even if that doctrine applied in the last-named case, it
                            was only as a technical rule of the prize courts requiring an
                            intervention there by the government whose territory had been violated,
                            and <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0166"/>was not applicable in the
                            case of an international tribunal, which should be controlled by the
                            consideration that the capture was an illegal one under international
                            law.</p>

                        <p>The counsel for the claimant also maintained that the insurers and
                            underwriters were to be deemed parties to the memorial by Mr. Gerard, as
                            their attorney in fact; that the assignment to Gerard was a valid one;
                            and that the contracts of insurance were also valid and entitled to
                            recognition and protection under international law.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) gave the claimants an
                            award for $272,920. I am advised that the award was placed by the
                            majority of the commission on the ground that the capture within the
                            neutral waters of Mexico was absolutely illegal and void; and that the
                            claimants were entitled to make reclamation on that ground, irrespective
                            of any question of complaint or intervention on the part of Mexico.</p>

                        <p>This vessel was captured while at anchor off the mouth of the Rio Grande,
                            on the 5th November, 1863; was taken into the port of New Orleans and
                            there libelled in the United States district court. A decree was made in
                            that court, 16th June, 1864, adjudging restitution of the vessel to the
                            claimants; from which decree the United States appealed to the Supreme
                            Court. Further proceedings were had in the district court on the
                            question of costs and damages; and, on the 3d June, 1865, a decree was
                            made adjudging that the costs and charges consequent upon the capture be
                            paid by the claimants, and that damages be refused to them.</p>
                        <p>From this decree the claimants appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme
                            Court affirmed the decree of the district court restoring the vessel and
                            cargo; but directed that the costs and expenses consequent upon the
                            capture be rateably apportioned between the vessel and the shipment of
                            coin hereinafter named; and that the residue of the cargo be exempted
                            from contribution. The district court determined, upon the <pb n="111"
                                xml:id="pg_111" facs="0167"/>proofs, that the vessel when captured
                            was anchored south of the line dividing the waters of the Rio Grande,
                            and was therefore in neutral waters.</p>
                        <p>The Supreme Court held, on the contrary, that the proofs clearly showed
                            her to have been anchored north of the division line above named and
                            within the waters of Texas, then in possession of the enemies of the
                            United States. The case in the Supreme Court is reported in 5th Wallace,
                            pages 170 to 178; to which report reference is made for the statement of
                            the peculiar facts of the case. No proofs were made before the
                            commission substantially changing the facts as there stated.</p>
                        <p>Many of the questions involved in this case were identical with those
                            involved in the case of the Sir William Peel above reported, and
                            therefore need not be again stated.</p>
                        <p>Edwin Gerard, No. 244, claimed as assignee of the insurers of Messrs. F.
                            DeLizardi &amp; Co., the alleged owners of 12,000 British sovereigns, a
                            portion of the cargo upon which, together with the vessel, the costs and
                            expenses consequent upon the capture were apportioned by the decree of

                            contribution and which had been duly abandoned to them as insurers, and
                            payments made by them respectively as upon a total loss.</p>
                        <p>Upon the two last-named claims of the insurance companies, questions were
                            raised on the part of the United States, as to the validity of the
                            contract of insurance in the same regard reported above in the case of
                            the Sir William Peel, and also as to the right of the insurance
                            companies to recover in respect of portions of the cargo owned by
                            persons not appearing to have been British subjects. This last-named
                            question was subsequently more distinctly raised and passed upon in the
                            case of the Circassian, and will be hereafter reported under that
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>

                            claimants for vessel; Edwin Gerard, No. 245, claimant for cargo.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured on the 5th November, 1863, at the mouth of the
                            Rio Grande, taken into the port of New Orleans, and there libelled. By a
                            decree rendered on the 11th June, 1864, the district court condemned the
                            vessel and cargo as lawful prize. From this decree the claimants
                            appealed to the Supreme Court, which court reversed the decree of
                            condemnation, but held that the capture was justified by “probable
                            cause,” and adjudged restitution of the vessel on payment of costs and
                            charges. The case is reported in the Supreme Court in 5th Wallace, <pb
                                n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0168"/>pp. 179, 180. It appeared that
                            the vessel, when captured, was anchored within Texan waters.</p>
                        <p>The claimants in No. 388 claimed as owners of the vessel for
                            reimbursement of the costs and charges paid by them, and for damages by
                            the detention of the vessel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gerard, in No. 245, claimed, as assignee of the insurers of the cargo
                            to whom the same had been abandoned, and who had paid as for a total
                            loss, about 140,000, besides interest, for depreciation of cargo after
                            the seizure, including the value of ninety-three cases of brandy,
                            alleged to have been abstracted from the vessel while in custody of the
                            officers of the district court.</p>
                        <p>The questions involved in respect to this vessel are substantially
                            covered by the report of the foregoing case of the Sir William Peel, and
                            by the report of the case in 5th Wallace.</p>
                        <p>The claim of Amy and others, No. 388, in respect of the vessel, was
                            unanimously disallowed by the commission.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Mr. Gerard, No. 245, the commission made an award in favor
                            of the claimant for $1,785, Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting. I am
                            advised that this award was made in respect of the brandy abstracted
                            while in charge of the officers of the district court; and that the
                            other claims for damages in the case were disallowed.</p>
                        <p>The bark Science; Thomas E. Angell and others, claimants, No. 391.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured at the same time and place with the Dashing Wave
                            and the Volant, libelled in the same court, and the same decrees entered
                            respectively as in the case of the Dashing Wave, and the same appeals
                            taken by the respective parties to the Supreme Court. That court
                            affirmed both judgments of the district court restoring the vessel, and
                            charging her with the costs and expenses of capture, finding upon the
                            proofs that she was, when captured, anchored within Texan waters, and
                            that no excuse appeared for her being there. The case in the Supreme
                            Court is reported in 5th Wallace, pp. 178, 179.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimants, in addition to the points above cited in
                            the case of the Sir William Peel applicable to this case, contended that
                            the capture was one made in bad faith; that the Science had arrived off
                            the mouth of the Rio Grande on the 11th August; that, immediately on her
                            arrival, she was boarded by an officer of a United States blockading
                            vessel, who examined her papers and inspected her cargo, and permitted
                            her to anchor and discharge her outward cargo, and take on board a large
                            portion of her return cargo; that the only allegation made by the
                            capturing officer was that her outward cargo had included cloth of the
                            character and description used for confederate uniforms; that this
                            allegation constituted no ground of capture, and even if originally it
                            might have afforded probable cause of capture, it certainly could not,
                            after the vessel had been allowed to lie three months in the offing, and
                            take on board a valuable cargo of over <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113"
                                facs="0169"/>300 bales of cot ion. That the fact of her being at
                            anchor within Texan waters, if it existed, did not of itself constitute
                            probable cause, there being no evidence in the case to indicate an
                            intention of violation of the blockade; that, by international law and
                            under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the roadstead at the mouth of the
                            Rio Grande was an open roadstead, where neutral vessels trading with
                            Matamoras had a right to lie at anchor, whether north or south of the
                            conventional line between the United States and Mexico established by
                            that treaty; and that the United States could no more lawfully interfere
                            with the enjoyment of that right than they could with the right of
                            vessels in course of the same trade to navigate the mouth and current of
                            the river; that the right to the navigation of the Rio Grande included
                            the right to the means without which such navigation could not be
                            reasonably enjoyed— among others, the right to moor in the roadstead at
                            its mouth. That, even if the United States could claim an exclusive
                            right to occupy the waters north of this line for the purpose of
                            blockade, that a vessel honestly engaged in trade with Matamoras, and
                            anchoring for that purpose on the Texan side of the line, was entitled
                            to notice or warning before it could be treated as intruding on
                            forbidden ground, and that a seizure without such notice was
                            unjustifiable; that, in fact, the proofs failed to establish that the
                            vessel was lying north of the dividing line, and that the blockading
                            vessels, by omitting to apprize her that she was anchored in a place
                            which they deemed an improper one, and by permitting her to be there and
                            take on board her return cargo, were estopped to allege that her
                            position was an unlawful one.</p>

                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the Science, and
                            the other vessels of her class, could not enter by reason of their
                            draught of water and never attempted to enter, the mouth of the Rio
                            Grande, or to reach the port of Matamoras. That, conceding her full
                            right to navigate that river and the waters through which its mouth was
                            to be approached, and even for that purpose to pass over the blockaded
                            waters of the Confederate States, it did not follow that she had the
                            right, for her own convenience and for the delivery of her cargo into
                            lighters, to cast anchor within those blockaded waters, and there lie
                            for weeks in a position from which access, by means of lighters to the
                            blockaded coast, was easier, by night or by day, than that to the
                            neutral port for which her cargo professed to be destined. That the
                            United States were lawfully entitled to blockade, and did blockade the
                            sea-coast of Texas, and that such blockade would be wholly nugatory if a
                            vessel in the condition of the Science could claim and exercise the
                            right to cast anchor within the blockaded waters, and within three miles
                            of the enemy’s <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0170"/>coast, from
                            which it was evident that she could, with great facility, hold
                            communication with that coast.</p>
                        <p>The commission awarded to the claimant the sum of $45,684, Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>

                            288.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured at the mouth of the Rio Grande at the same time
                            with the Dashing Wave, the Volant, and the Science, and libelled in the
                            United States district court at New Orleans. The district court, on the
                            proofs, decided that, at the time of the capture, she was in Mexican
                            waters, and gave judgment of restitution, certifying reasonable cause of
                            capture, and refusing allowance of costs or expenses to the claimant. No
                            appeal was taken from the judgment of the district court.</p>
                        <p>Under the order of the commission the claimant assigned as the reason of
                            his omission to appeal, that, “in consequence of the short space of time
                            in which to appeal, only thirty clays being allowed for that purpose,
                            and the detention of the mails, and the counsel in New Orleans not
                            having taken the appeal, the time to appeal expired.”</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was claimed that the proofs showed
                            probable cause of capture in the conduct and position of the Matamoras;
                            but this was denied on the part of the claimants. The counsel for the
                            United States insisted that no sufficient excuse was assigned for the
                            failure to appeal.</p>
                        <p>The commission disallowed the claim, (Mr. Commissioner Gurney
                            dissenting,) on the ground of the insufficiency of the reasons for
                            failure to appeal.</p>
                        <p>The Isabel; George Wigg, claimant, No. 269.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured on the 23d September, 1852, on a voyage from
                            Bayport, in Florida, to Havana; was taken into the port of Key West,
                            there libelled in the United States district court before Judge Marvin,
                            and condemned as lawful prize. An appeal was taken, under the then
                            existing law, to the circuit court of the United States for the same
                            district; and this appeal was subsequently, under the United States
                            statutes of 3d March, 1863, (12 Stats, at L., 730, § 7,) and of 30th
                            June, 1861, (13 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 311, § 13,) transferred by
                            stipulation to the Supreme Court, in which court the claimant having
                            failed to file the transcript from the court below, pursuant to the
                            rules of that court, the case was dismissed, on motion of the United
                            States, without appearance on the part of the claimant. The claimant
                            alleged himself the sole owner of both vessel and cargo; and alleged
                            that the port of Bayport, from which the vessel sailed, was not
                            blockaded at the time of the capture or of the entrance or departure of
                            the Isabel into and from that port. The fact of no blockade was sought
                            to be established by the testimony of the master and <pb n="115"
                                xml:id="pg_115" facs="0171"/>crew of the vessel, who testified that
                            they saw no blockading vessels on entering or departing. The time of day
                            or night of their entrance or departure was not shown.</p>
                        <p>The counsel of the United States relied on the official reports of the
                            Secretary of the Navy and accompanying documents for the years 1862 and
                            1883, and upon the decision of the district court having judicial
                            knowledge of the current historical facts of the day, as sufficiently
                            establishing the fact of blockade. Documentary proofs were filed on the
                            part of the United States going to show the claimant, Wigg, at the time
                            of the capture of the vessel actually engaged in shipping munitions of
                            war to the confederate government; and that both before and after the
                            capture, he and the vessels which he owned or controlled were for a long
                            time largely engaged in the like employment.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained: 1, that the Isabel
                            was lawfully captured in the actual course of a voyage in violation of
                            the blockade; 2, that, by the failure of the claimant to prosecute his
                            appeal to the Supreme Court, and procure an adjudication of that court
                            upon the merits of his case, he was debarred from a standing before the
                            commission; 3, that, by his personal acts in aid of the enemies of the
                            United States in carrying on their war against those States, the
                            claimant was debarred of any standing as a British subject before the
                            commission; 4, that, by those acts, he had constituted himself an enemy
                            of the United States, so that his property upon the high seas was liable
                            to capture as enemy’s property, irrespective of any question of
                            blockade.</p>
                        <p>All these propositions were controverted on the part of the claimant.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>The steamship Pearl; Shand, Higson &amp; Co., claimants, No. 270.</p>
                        <p>The Pearl was captured in January, 1863, by a United States cruiser, in
                            the Atlantic Ocean, between the Bahama Banks and Nassau, on a voyage
                            purporting to be from Queenstown to Nassau. She was taken into the port
                            of Key West, and there libelled as prize on the alleged ground that her
                            actual destination was for one of the blockaded ports. Mr. Geo. Wigg
                            intervened as claimant in the district court, alleging himself the sole
                            and absolute owner of the vessel. The district court adjudged
                            restitution of the vessel and cargo. An appeal was taken by the United
                            States to the Supreme Court, and that court reversed the decree of the
                            district court, and adjudged condemnation of the vessel and cargo. (See
                            report of the case of the Pearl, 5th Wallace, 574.)</p>
                        <p>The claimants here alleged that the vessel, though purchased by Wigg in
                            his own name, was actually purchased by him as agent for Messrs. J.
                            &amp; T. Johnson, merchants of Liverpool, to whom she actually belonged,
                            though registered in the name of Wigg. That J. &amp; T. Johnson had,
                            since the condemnation, assigned to the claimants, by way of mortgage,
                            their claim upon the United States for the alleged wrongful capture and
                            condemnation. No proofs were made by the claimants of the <pb n="116"
                                xml:id="pg_116" facs="0172"/>title of the Messrs. Johnson, nor of
                            the assignment of the claim by them to the claimants.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <p>The schooner D. F. Keeling: Mary Hutchinson, claimant, No. 277.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was seized in the port of New York, on the 6th October, 1861,
                            and libelled in the United States district court for confiscation under
                            the statute of 13th July, 1861, (12 Stat, at L.,) as the property of an
                            inhabitant of the State of Louisiana, then in rebellion against the
                            United States. The claimant, Mary Hutchinson, interposed a claim to the
                            vessel, denying that she was an inhabitant of New Orleans, alleging
                            herself a native-born subject of Great Britain, and only transiently
                            present in New Orleans upon a visit to relatives there residing. The
                            district court found this allegation sustained by the proofs, and
                            adjudged restitution of the vessel, certifying probable cause of
                            seizure, and refusing costs or damages to the claimant. No appeal was
                            taken from the decree of the district court. On the part of the claimant
                            an affidavit of one Leetch was filed, excusing the omission to appeal on
                            the ground that his own business required him to return home immediately
                            to Mexico, (he having been at the time the agent of Mrs. Hutchinson,)
                            and that Mrs. Hutchinson was not able to attend to the appeal in person,
                            “by reason of age and infirmity.” The claimant’s memorial, verified by
                            her own oath, alleged that she was born in 1813, making her forty-eight
                            years old at the date of the decree of restitution. She claimed here
                            damages by the detention of the vessel, and costs incurred in defense of
                            the suit, $18,063, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>The proofs before the commission showed that the claimant emigrated with
                            her husband to New Orleans about 1850; that her husband died there in
                            1852, and that the claimant had ever since, up to the date of the
                            deposition, (February, 1873,) been permanently domiciled in New
                            Orleans.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the proof here
                            fully showed the liability of the vessel to condemnation before the
                            district court; that such condemnation was there defeated by false
                            allegations and proofs; that, on the merits, the claimant was not
                            entitled to damages; and that no sufficient reason was shown for her
                            failure to appeal from the decree of the district court.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>

                        <p>Messrs. Sanders &amp; Sons, merchants of Nassau, filed their memorial
                            claiming damages, in all $142,643, besides interest, for the alleged
                            wrongful capture and condemnation of the twenty-seven vessels
                            above-named. <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0173"/>Their memorial
                            contained simply a general averment that their vessels were lawfully
                            engaged in trade “with certain ports of the United States which were
                            held open by the Government of the United States to foreign commerce,
                            and also with certain ports of Great Britain and other nations.” That
                            they were with their cargoes “unlawfully and wrongfully captured, in
                            violation of the law of nations,” by cruisers of the United States, and
                            condemned and sold. A schedule of the different vessels, with copies of
                            the respective registers, was filed with the memorial. No other proofs
                            were filed for the claimants, and the claim was unanimously
                            disallowed.</p>
                        <p>The schooner Echo; Peter A. Spear water, claimant, No. 284.</p>
                        <p>The Echo was captured by a United States vessel of war on the 31st of
                            May, 1863, on a voyage from Matamoras to New York; was taken into the
                            port of Key West; there libelled in the district court; by which court
                            judgment of restitution was awarded, certifying probable cause of
                            capture, and refusing costs or damages to the claimants. No appeal was
                            taken and no reason was assigned for the failure to appeal. In the
                            testimony before the prize court the mate of the vessel testified that
                            the cargo was taken on board at the mouth of the Rio Grande, and was
                            purchased by the claimant himself in Brownsville, Texas, a town of the
                            Confederate States; that the Echo lay off the mouth of the Rio Grande
                            for about four months, from January till May, 1863; that, during most of
                            that time, the claimant, the owner and master of the vessel, was in
                            Brownsville and there purchased the cotton in question. The claimant
                            himself, in his deposition denied these statements of his mate; and the
                            district judge deemed the evidence insufficient to justify condemnation,
                            but sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>The bark Springbok; John Riley, manager, &amp;c, No. 442, claimant for
                            vessel; S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co. and Thomas Stirling Begbie, No. 316,
                            claimants for cargo.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured by a United States cruiser, on the 3d February,
                            1863, on the Atlantic Ocean, about one hundred and fifty miles east of
                            Nassau, New Providence; was taken into the port of New York, and there
                            libelled in the district court. That court rendered a decree of
                            condemnation of both vessel and cargo. (See the report of the case, B
                            latch ford’s Prize Cases, pp. 434 to 463.) The claimants appealed to the
                            Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment of condemnation of the
                            district court as to the cargo, but reversed it as to the vessel,
                            adjudging restitution of the vessel, but without costs or damages to the
                            claimants. (5 Wall, 1.)</p>
                        <p>The claimant John Riley, No. 442, claimed as manager of the London A 1
                            Insurance Association, the A 1 Guarantee Insurance Association, <pb
                                n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0174"/>and the Colonial A 1 Insurance
                            Association, insurers of the vessel, and who had, on abandonment by the
                            owners, paid as for a total loss. He claimed an award for £4,615,
                            besides interest, damages for the detention of the vessel, loss of
                            profits, and costs and expenses in the prize-courts.</p>
                        <p>The claimants S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co., and Begbie, claimed £68,378,
                            the alleged value of the condemned cargo, and costs and expenses in the
                            prize courts. The facts of the case as appearing before the prize courts
                            are sufficiently set forth in the reports of the respective courts above
                            cited.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the proofs before the prize courts the claimants gave
                            evidence before the commission tending to show that the actual and
                            ultimate destination of the cargo was Nassau, and that it was intended
                            to be there sold in open market by the agent of the owners.</p>
                        <p>This evidence consisted of the testimony of the agent of the claimants at
                            Nassau to that effect, certain letters from the claimants to said agent
                            proved by him, and general proofs showing that there was at Nassau a
                            market for the various kinds of merchandise constituting the cargo of
                            the vessel.</p>
                        <p>Neither of the claimants for the cargo placed himself upon the stand to
                            testify as to the actual destination or the intent of the owners in
                            relation to it. The claimant Begbie was examined as a witness in behalf
                            of Mr. Riley, the claimant in No. 442; and, on his examination-in-chief,
                            testified merely that the cargo of the Springbok was to be discharged at
                            Nassau; that there was no agreement for the continuance of the voyage,
                            or for the employment or engagement of the vessel after her arrival at
                            Nassau; and that the captain of the vessel knew nothing of the ownership
                            of the cargo. On cross-examination he declined to answer as to whether
                            he was, in the years 1862 or 1863, engaged in blockade-running
                            speculations, and whether he was, at the time of her capture, the owner
                            of the Gertrude or her cargo, (this being the vessel referred to in the
                            report of the case in the Supreme Court, and the proofs upon the
                            condemnation of which were invoked in the case of the Springbok.)</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States evidence was given showing both the firm
                            of S. Isaac Campbell &amp; Co. and Begbie actively and largely engaged
                            in blockade-running ventures, and in supplying by contract the
                            confederate government with military supples. These proofs included
                            original contracts and letters between the claimants S. Isaac Campbell
                            &amp; Co. and the confederate secretary of war, and other officials,
                            showing contracts by that firm, running through the years 1882 and 1863,
                            for cannon, rifles, swords, accoutrements, gunpowder, shells, clothing,
                            &amp;c., in large quantities, and delivery of the same to the
                            confederate government under such contracts to the amount of several
                            hundred thousand pounds. Also evidence showing the claimant Begbie a
                            contractor with the confederate government for the establishment of
                            lines of fast steamers, to run in the service of that government between
                            the blockaded ports of the Confederate States and ports in the West
                            indies.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0175"/>
                        <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that the proofs in the
                            prize court tailed to sustain the conclusions of the district court,
                            that the vessel “was knowingly laden in whole or in part with articles
                            contraband of war, with intent to deliver such articles to the aid and
                            use of the enemy;” that the true destination of the ship and cargo was
                            not Nassau, a neutral port, and for trade and commerce, but some port
                            lawfully blockaded by the forces of the United States, and with intent
                            to violate such blockade; and, further, that the papers of the vessel
                            were simulated and false. That they also failed to sustain the
                            conclusions of the Supreme Court, “that the cargo was originally shipped
                            with an intent to violate the blockade; that the owners of the cargo
                            intended that it should be trans-shipped at Nassau into some vessel more
                            likely to succeed in reaching safely a blockaded port than the
                            Springbok; that the voyage from London to the blockaded port was, as to
                            cargo, both in law and in the intent of the parties, one voyage, and
                            that the liability to condemnation, if captured during any part of that
                            voyage, attached to the cargo from the time of sailing.”</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimants further contended that the proofs filed for
                            the first time before this commission conclusively rebutted these
                            conclusions of each of the prize courts, and established the ultimate
                            destination of both ship and cargo to be Nassau, the cargo to be there
                            sold in open market.</p>
                        <p>The counsel called attention to an error in the opinion of the Supreme
                            Court in stating sixteen dozen swords and ten dozen rifle-bayonets as
                            forming part of the cargo of the Springbok, when in fact the proofs
                            showed the vessel to have carried only one sample-case containing one
                            dozen cavalry-swords and one dozen rifle-bayonets; and to the fact that,
                            on the sale of the cargo, the entire proceeds of the swords and
                            bayonets, and of the army and navy buttons, were only $270 out of the
                            gross proceeds of the entire cargo of nearly $250,000; and that,
                            including the army blankets, saltpetre, and all that portion of the
                            cargo which could be regarded for any purpose as <hi rend="italic"
                                >quasi</hi> contraband, the proceeds of such alleged contraband
                            goods were less than one per cent, of the proceeds of the entire cargo.
                            He urged that the judgment of the Supreme Court sustained “extreme
                            pretensions of belligerent right to subjugate neutral commerce to its
                            necessities,” which ought not to be sustained by this international
                            tribunal; that, to sustain the doctrine of liability to capture on the
                            theory of “continuous voyage,” it must appear that the cargo was
                            intended as a part of the original and planned adventure to be carried
                            from the neutral port to the enemy’s port; that the extreme doctrine in
                            this regard had been stated by the Supreme Court in the case of the
                            Bermuda, (3 Wallace, 515,) as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>A voyage from a neutral to a belligerent port is one and the same
                                    voyage, whether the destination be ulterior or direct, and
                                    whether with or without the interposition of one or more
                                    intermediate ports, and whether to be performed by one vessel or
                                    several employed in the same transaction and in the
                                    accomplishment of the same purpose.</p>

                        <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0176"/>
                        <p>That the measure of this doctrine, as applied by the Supreme Court to the
                            case of the Bermuda, was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>What has already been adduced of the evidence satisfies us
                                    completely that the original destination of the Bermuda was to a
                                    blockaded port; or, if otherwise, to an intermediate port, with
                                    intent to send forward the cargo by trans-shipment into a vessel
                                    provided for the completion of the voyage.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>That, with the doctrine of continuous voyage as thus limited and defined,
                            nothing in the case of the Springbok involves any necessary controversy;
                            but that this doctrine ought not to be extended so as to make guilty a
                            trade between neutral ports to which the intercepted voyage was actually
                            and really confined, by surmise, conjecture, or moral evidence not of a
                            further carriage and further carrier, but only of a probability that
                            such supplementary further carriage and <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
                            supplementary further carrier may or must have been included in the
                            original scheme of the commercial adventure. That such a fiction of
                            continuous voyage for the case of all trade between neutral ports, which
                            has its stimulus from the state of war, made the belligerent prize court
                            master of neutral commerce, and in fact established a paper blockade of
                            the neutral ports in question, and left their commerce at the mercy of
                            the belligerent. That the whole history of prize jurisdiction on the
                            doctrine of continuous voyage shows that the province of probable
                            reasoning has been confined to the question of intent, while the <hi
                                rend="italic">corpus delicti</hi>—the voyage to the enemy port—must
                            be proved with the same definiteness of vehicle, port, and process of
                            execution as is confessedly essential when the voyage is direct and
                            simple.</p>
                        <p>That the original capture of the Springbok was wholly unjustifiable; that
                            the visitation and search disclosed nothing which rendered her voyage
                            amenable to further molestation; that there was nothing in the vessel,
                            her cargo, or her papers, her position, or the circumstances of her
                            capture, justifying the cruiser in sending the vessel into port for
                            libel, on the speculation that it might be that the cargo was to go
                            forward, and, if so, that fact perhaps might be provable; that it was a
                            marked case of speculative seizure and detention, not upon indications
                            which the visit and search at sea disclosed, but for the purpose of a
                            visitation and search in the prize courts for independent, extraneous,
                            and argumentative grounds of suspicion.</p>
                        <p>That the trial in the prize court violated the essential principles of
                            the prize jurisdiction as established between belligerents and neutrals,
                            and in which the latter find the limits of their exposure and
                            submission. That the rule of the prize courts that condemnation could
                            only be justified upon the proof furnished by the vessel itself, her
                            papers, and cargo, and the depositions of those on board, is not a mere
                            matter of practice or form, but is of the very essence of the
                            administration of prize law. That, accordingly, the invocation by the
                            captors of the papers from the cases of the Gertrude and Stephen Hart as
                            part of the primary proofs on which to condemn the Springbok and her
                            cargo, was unprecedented, acknowledged <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121"
                                facs="0177"/>by the Supreme Court to be irregular and not in
                            accordance with the rules of proceeding in prize, and was not a mere
                            irregularity in form but was subversive of the principles of prize
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>That the passing of condemnation without giving the claimants an
                            opportunity for further proof, was a manifest injustice; and that the
                            absolute condemnation without such opportunity for further proofs was
                            contrary to the rightful system of prize jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>That the presence of the trivial amount of contraband (as held by the
                            prize court) could not be regarded either as evidence of its own
                            destination or of that of its accompanying innocent cargo to an ulterior
                            market, nor as ground for condemnation independent of the question of
                            intended breach of blockade; citing on this point Dr. Gessner’s <hi

                            that her papers were regular and her voyage a <hi rend="italic">bona
                                fide</hi> one between London and Nassau; that the papers were all
                            genuine, and there was no concealment of any of them, and no spoliation;
                            that the owners were neutrals, appeared to have no interest in the
                            cargo, and could have had no knowledge of its alleged unlawful
                            destination; that these conclusions of the Supreme Court upon the
                            evidence before it were strengthened and completely sustained by the
                            additional testimony taken before the commission; that the grounds on
                            which the Supreme Court denied costs and damages to the claimants of the
                            vessel, to wit? misrepresentation by the master on his examination as to
                            his lack of knowledge of the grounds on which the capture was made, and
                            the fact that he had signed bills of lading which did not state truly
                            and fully the nature of the goods contained in the bales and cases
                            mentioned in them, were unsustained as matters of fact by the evidence,
                            and, even if sustained, were in themselves not of the least
                            significance, and did not and could not affect the interests or issues
                            involved in the capture? that, so far as the vessel and her owners were
                            concerned, her voyage was <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0178"
                            />honest, her papers fair, and the good faith of the charter-party
                            absolute and unimpeachable, and the declarations and conduct of her
                            captain not so obnoxious to just criticism as to justify the infliction
                            of punishment upon the innocent owners.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the conclusions
                            arrived at by the Supreme Court as above stated, and upon which the
                            decree of that court condemning the cargo was based, were fully
                            sustained by the evidence before the prize court. That the claimants of
                            the cargo had, by the judgment of the Supreme Court, full notice of the
                            grounds on which the cargo was condemned, those grounds relating
                            principally to their own previous conduct in furnishing military
                            supplies to the confederate government and in running the blockade, and
                            to the presumption raised by the circumstances of the case as to their
                            own design and intention in regard to the destination of the cargo.
                            That, notwithstanding this notice, they had failed to avail themselves
                            of the opportunity afforded them before the commission to testily as to
                            the facts and conclusions thus found by the Supreme Court; and that in
                            the case of Mr. Begbie, when placed upon the stand involuntarily, he had
                            refused to answer concerning these very matters. That this failure and
                            refusal to testify on the part of the claimants was to be taken as in
                            effect an admission of the correctness of the conclusions of the
                            court.</p>
                        <p>That by the evidence adduced before the commission the fact was fully
                            established that all these claimants of the cargo were extensively
                            engaged in running the blockade, and also in furnishing military
                            supplies to the enemy. That the facts thus proved went strongly to
                            confirm the conclusions of the court that the cargo was destined and
                            intended for trans-shipment to and delivery in the Confederate States,
                            and not for a market at Nassau. That they also established that these
                            claimants legally and morally were not neutrals, but enemies of the
                            United States actually engaged in the prosecution of the war against
                            those States: and that, as such, their property on the high seas was
                            liable to capture without regard to the question of blockade. That the
                            question of national character in such case was always a question of the
                            individual national character of the owner, and not of his national
                            character as established by paramount allegiance, citing the Anna
                            Catherina, 4 Rob., 119$ the Vigilantia, 1 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 1;
                            the Vriendschap, 4 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 166, and the authorities
                            cited in 3 Phillimore, 605, 606. That these proofs also precluded the
                            claimants from a standing before this commission as neutral British
                            subjects. That as to the vessel, the capture and condemnation of the
                            cargo being lawful, the seizure of the vessel and taking her into port
                            was also lawful as the sole means of reaching the cargo which was lawful
                            prize, and that in such case the vessel was not entitled to costs or
                            damages.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim for the cargo in No. 316.
                            In the claim for the vessel, No. 442, they unanimously awarded to the
                            claimant the sum of $5,065. I am advised that this award was made in
                            respect of the detention of the vessel from the date of the <pb n="123"

                        <p>This vessel, then known as the Salvor, was owned at the breaking out of
                            the rebellion by James McKay, a citizen of Florida. In September, 18.61,
                            McKay took her to Havana, and there went through the form of a sale of
                            the vessel to McLennan, the present claimant, who caused her to be
                            registered in his name at the British consulate at Havana, and
                            re-christened her the M. S. Perry. A bill of sale was given by McKay to
                            McLennan, specifying the nominal consideration of $32,000. On the 13th
                            October, 1861, she sailed from Havana with the ostensible destination of
                            Nassau, but with written instructions to go to the main-land of Florida
                            and there land Donald McKay, a son of the former owner, who went as a
                            passenger, together with several negro slaves of the former owner,
                            McKay. McKay, senior, himself sailed with her for Nassau? holding a
                            power of attorney from McLennan, authorizing him to collect the freight
                            at Nassau.</p>
                        <p>She was captured on the night of the 13th October, at a point between the
                            Dry Tortugas and the coast of Florida, being headed for the western
                            coast of the peninsula of Florida, and in a position quite wide of the
                            proper course to Nassau, and separated from that port by the whole width
                            of the peninsula of Florida and the waters intervening between that
                            peninsula and the Bahamas. She was taken into the port of Philadelphia,
                            there libelled in the district court, condemned, and sold. No appeal was
                            taken from the judgment of the prize court; but the commission held, as
                            has been already stated, the reasons assigned for the failure to appeal
                            sufficient. The proofs taken before the prize court were not put in
                            evidence before the commission.</p>
                        <p>From the testimony taken before the commission, it appeared that McLennan
                            was a merchant’s clerk in Havana, not engaged in shipping, and owning no
                            interest in any other vessel than the M. S. Perry. When examined himself
                            as a witness, McLennan refused to say whether he possessed any property
                            or money to enable him to make such a purchase; but it appeared that he
                            gave McKay his promissory notes for the amount of the purchase-money at
                            six, twelve, and eighteen months, without any security for their payment
                            by mortgage on the vessel or otherwise. It did not appear that anything
                            had ever been paid on the notes; and the claimant, when asked on
                            cross-examination whether they had ever been paid, declined to answer.
                            McKay remained in the sole actual management of the vessel after the
                            sale, and employed the captain, the chief engineer, and the ship broker
                            who obtained her freight. McKay also held a power of attorney from
                            McLennan to recover and receive whatever indemnity or compensation
                            should be awarded by the commission <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                                facs="0180"/>in the premises; he verified the memorial filed by the
                            claimant; and he alone appeared to have procured the attendance of
                            witnesses, and to have prosecuted the case before the commission.</p>
                        <p>A considerable portion of the cargo of the M. S. Perry, upon her capture,
                            consisted of arms and ammunition, of the ownership of which no proof was
                            made, and for which no claim was prosecuted before the commission.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that these facts
                            clearly indicated the pretended sale by McKay to McLennan to be
                            colorable merely, and that upon them the claimant had shown no title to
                            recover; that the direction to the vessel to land young McKay and the
                            negro slaves on the coast of Florida was an attempt to violate the
                            blockade, and justified the capture; that the omission of the claimant
                            to produce the testimony before the prize court left the judgment of
                            that court to be presumed fully sustained by the evidence, and that in
                            the absence of that evidence the commission could not declare the
                            judgment erroneous.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>The steamship Granite City; Edward Pembroke, claimant, No. 377.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured on the 22d March, 1863, on a voyage from Nassau,
                            at which port she had cleared nominally for Saint John’s, New Brunswick.
                            She had shortly before taken a cargo of merchandise from Nassau, through
                            the blockade, to Wilmington, N. C, and succeeded in getting through
                            safely, though fired at by the blockaders, and had also succeeded in
                            running out a cargo of cotton through the blockade. In his deposition
                                <hi rend="italic">in preparatorio</hi>, her master, after repeated
                            refusals to state to what port the vessel was actually bound at the time
                            of her capture, finally voluntarily stated, at the end of his
                            deposition, “that he was bound to run the blockade into some confederate
                            port wherever he could get in; and if he could not get in, to go
                            elsewhere.” The proof was unquestioned that she was captured in the
                            prosecution of a voyage designed to violate the blockade. During the
                            pursuit by the captors, and immediately before the capture, a package of
                            papers, of whose contents the captain professed himself ignorant, was
                            burned by his orders.</p>
                        <p>She was libelled in the United States district court for the southern
                            district of New York, and a decree of condemnation was rendered by that
                            court. (See report of the case, Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 355–357.)
                            Pending the proceedings in the district court, and before the decree of
                            condemnation, the vessel was taken for the use of the United States at
                            an appraised value, under the United States statute of March 3, 1863.
                            (12 Stat, at L., 759.) The cargo was sold under the decree. The claimant
                            alleged himself the owner of the vessel and cargo, and claimed damages,
                            $462,000, besides interest. No appeal was taken from the decree of the
                            district court. The claimant filed, under the order of the commission, a
                            statement of the reasons for his failure to appeal, alleging in effect
                                <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0181"/>that the decree of
                            condemnation was by default, the claimant not having appeared in the
                            prize court, and that, the vessel having been taken by the United
                            States, he had no funds, or means of securing funds, wherewith to
                            appeal.</p>
                        <p>The case was decided without a specific decision upon the sufficiency of
                            these reasons.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the capture was
                            illegal, in that the vessel had received no warning, and that she was
                            captured on the high seas, and not in the act of violating the blockade
                            by crossing that part of the sea which had been conquered by the
                            blockading power. That the declarations of the master, as to the object
                            and intent of the voyage, did not constitute the offence of violating
                            the blockade, nor authorize the capture. That the fact of the former
                            running of the blockade was not to be taken as proof of the illicit
                            character of the voyage in the course of which she was captured. That
                            the spoliation of papers shown did not constitute sufficient ground of
                            condemnation, and generally that the grounds of condemnation assigned by
                            the court were insufficient under well-settled principles of
                            international law, and without precedent in maritime jurisprudence. That
                            the prosecution of an appeal from the decision of the prize court was
                            not necessary to lay the foundation for reclamation before the
                            commission. That the appropriation of the vessel to the use of the
                            United States before condemnation was an unlawful act, and of itself
                            gave sufficient ground for reclamation. That that act deprived the prize
                            court of jurisdiction, the proceeding being <hi rend="italic">in
                                rem</hi>, and the subject of the litigation, therefore, must
                            necessarily be before the court, in order to sustain their
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimants cited the case of the bark Jones, before

                        <p>The bark Empress; John Loft, mortgagee, claimant, No. 387.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured off the mouth of the Mississippi River, in
                            November, 1861, sent into the port of New York, and there libelled for
                                <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0182"/>adjudication as prize in
                            the district court. The district court adjudged condemnation of vessel
                            and cargo, (Blatehford’s Prize Cases, 175.) An appeal was taken to the
                            circuit court of the United States for the same district, under the
                            practice then existing, which court reversed the judgment of the
                            district court and awarded restitution, (<hi rend="italic">id.</hi>,
                            659,) but without costs or damages to the claimants. Pending the
                            proceedings in the prize court the vessel was sold and the proceeds,
                            less the costs taxed against the same, were paid into the hands of the
                            proctors of the claimants in the prize court, Pearson and others, the
                            owners of the vessel.</p>
                        <p>The memorial alleged that this money was attached in the hands of the
                            proctors by creditors of Pearson, and that Pearson’s interest in the
                            same was appropriated to the payment of the debts due from him to the
                            attaching creditors. The claimant, Loft, alleged himself the holder of a
                            mortgage given by the owner, Pearson, to him to secure the sum of £1,000
                            and interest, which mortgage was wholly due and unpaid. It alleged that
                            the claimant had never received any notice of the capture of the bark,
                            except as he learned the fact from the owners some time after the
                            capture, and that he was then informed by the owners that they were
                            taking the necessary and proper steps in the law courts for the purpose
                            of protecting their interests.</p>
                        <p>The memorial also alleged that the bark, at the time of her capture, was
                            worth the sum of £1,000, and that it became largely depreciated in value
                            by being suffered to remain without repairs, and without proper care
                            being taken of it during the time it was detained prior to the sale. The
                            claimant claimed the amount of his mortgage, £1,000 and interest.</p>
                        <p>His counsel contended that the decree of the circuit court having ordered
                            the restitution of the vessel to the claimants free of all costs and
                            charges, it was plain that that decree had not been executed, over
                            $2,000 having been retained from the proceeds as costs and charges, and
                            the proofs failing to show that the remainder of the proceeds even were
                            ever paid over in any manner under the decree of the court.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States, it was contended that from the memorial
                            itself it appeared that the proceeds of the vessel were regularly paid
                            over to the proctors of the owners, the only claimants appearing in the
                            prize court, excepting only costs allowed by the court as claimants’
                            costs out of the fund. That it further appeared from the memorial that
                            these funds thus paid over to the proctors were appropriated by regular
                            judicial process to the payment of claims of attaching creditors of the
                            owners. That, if the claimant, Loft, as mortgagee, had a valid lien upon
                            the vessel, that lien could have been followed against the proceeds due,
                            had he seen fit to take the necessary steps for that purpose; and that

                            That, as to the sum withheld for costs, nothing appeared to show that
                            that sum was excessive in amount, or was improperly withheld; and that
                            if such had been the case, the remedy of the claimant <pb n="127"

                            his interests before the prize court, was ample before the courts
                            themselves. That the whole case showed no ground of international
                            reclamation on behalf of this claimant.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>

                        <p>These vessels were captured at different times in 1862, 1863, and 1864,
                            by war vessels of the United States, and duly condemned in the prize
                            courts of original jurisdiction. No question was made but that they were
                            all at the time of capture engaged in voyages intended for violation of
                            the blockade. No appeals were taken from the prize courts of original
                            jurisdiction before which they were respectively condemned. The
                            claimants filed their reasons for failure to appeal, in which they
                            alleged poverty and destitution of means to defray the expense of
                            appeal, ignorance of the circumstances of the capture, imprisonment of
                            the masters and crews, and previous adverse decisions by the Supreme
                            Court in like cases, as the excuses for non-appeal.</p>
                        <p>No specific ruling was made by the commission on the sufficiency of these
                            reasons, but the cases were submitted on their merits, the only claim on
                            the part of the claimants being that they were respectively entitled to
                            formal notice and warning by a blockading vessel before they could be
                            subjected to capture. This question was not argued, and the commission
                            unanimously disallowed the claims.</p>

                            390.</p>
                        <p>This was a Dutch vessel, sailing under charter-party to the firm of
                            Galbraith, Red gate &amp; Co., of Glasgow and Matamoras, for a voyage
                            from Liverpool to Matamoras and back. She was captured on the 4th
                            December, 1864, on the outward voyage, within the blockaded waters of
                            the coast of Texas, and off the port of Brazos Santiago, situated some
                            ten to fifteen miles north of the mouth of the Rio Grande; was taken
                            into the port of New Orleans and there libelled, and in that court a
                            decree of condemnation was rendered on the 2d February, 1865. The
                            claimant applied for a rehearing in the district court, which was
                            granted, and further proof allowed. Jansen, the Dutch master of the
                            brig, was then re-examined in his own language, with the aid of an
                            interpreter; and on the 25th March, 1865, the judgment of condemnation
                            before rendered was annulled, and judgment of restitution awarded,
                            certifying reasonable cause of seizure, and refusing costs and damages
                            to claimant. From this decree both parties appealed, Captain Jansen
                            representing the owners of both vessel and cargo. The Supreme Court, on
                            the hearing, and without any written opinion, unanimously affirmed the
                            decree in all respects.</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0184"/>
                        <p>The claim here was brought by Easton as trustee under a trust deed for
                            the benefit of creditors executed by the firm of Galbraith, Redgate
                            &amp; Co., the alleged owners of the cargo. Samuel J. Redgate, one of
                            the members of this firm, and who was also the claimant in case No. 420,
                            hereinbefore reported, and one of the beneficiaries in No. 439,
                            hereafter reported under the head of the Peterhoff, appeared to be a
                            citizen of the United States. The vessel, when first seen, was not only
                            within the blockaded waters of Texas, but was apparently seeking to
                            effect an entrance into the inlet of Brazos Santiago. Prom the proofs
                            taken in the prize court, however, it was evident that there was no
                            intention to violate the blockade, and that Captain Jansen was seeking
                            to effect this entrance under the mistaken impression that it was the
                            mouth of the Rio Grande. The cargo of the vessel, though containing
                            nothing strictly contraband of war, was in large part fitted and
                            apparently designed for the confederate markets.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the circumstances
                            under which the vessel was captured sufficiently justified the capture
                            as one of “probable cause,” and that no ground existed for overruling or
                            questioning the judgment of the United States courts upon the case.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was insisted that a proper and reasonable
                            examination of the books and papers of the vessel, together with the
                            explanation of her position given by her officers, ought to have fully
                            satisfied the captors of her innocent intent, and to have prevented her
                            detention and taking into port for libel.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>The steamship Adela; Arthur Bower For wood and James Dorrington, No. 392,
                            claimants for the vessel; Arthur Bower For wood and William Bower
                            Forwood, No. 393, claimants for cargo.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured on the 7th July, 1862, near the island of Abaco,
                            one of the Bahama Islands, and a possession of Her Britannic Majesty, in
                            a voyage from Liverpool ostensibly to Nassau. She was taken into the
                            port of Key West, and there libelled in the district court, and a decree
                            of condemnation of both vessel and cargo was there rendered. The
                            claimants appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the
                            judgment of the district court was affirmed. (See report of the case, 6
                            Wall., 266.)</p>
                        <p>The Adela was a small side-wheel steamer of light draught, fleet, well
                            adapted for service as a blockade-runner and for short trips like those
                            between Nassau and Charleston or Savannah, but unfit for carrying on
                            trade in voyages of the length of that from Liverpool to Nassau. Her
                            cargo on the outward voyage was light, consisting only of twenty cases
                            of Enfield rifles and twenty-five boxes of cartridges, which had been
                            discharged at Bermuda before her capture, and of some <pb n="129"
                                xml:id="pg_129" facs="0185"/>fifty, packages of boots and shoes,
                            which were captured and condemned, and which were the subject of the
                            claim in No. 393.</p>
                        <p>This claim for the cargo, in No. 393, was withdrawn by the claimants by
                            leave of the commission after the completion of the claimants’ proofs.
                            In No. 392 proofs were taken before the commission in addition to those
                            taken in the prize court, which were also put before the commission.</p>
                        <p>The position of the Adela, when first summoned by the capturing vessel,
                            as well as when actually captured, was a matter of dispute upon the
                            facts of the case, the witnesses on the part of the claimant giving
                            evidence tending to show that when first summoned, as well as when
                            actually captured, she was within a marine league of the shores of the
                            island of Abaco, while the evidence on the part of the defence tended to
                            show that at both times she was more than that distance from the shore
                            and upon the high seas.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that there was no sufficient
                            proof of the Adela being engaged in an unlawful voyage; and also that
                            the capture, being made within British and neutral waters, was unlawful
                            and void, and the owners entitled to make reclamation.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the preponderance
                            of the evidence was in favor of the lawfulness of the capture as made
                            upon the high seas, and not in the neutral waters of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States urged that the doctrine of the
                            sovereignty of the proprietary nation over the sea for a marine league
                            from the shore is founded in the idea of a proper and necessary
                            protection to the adjacent coasts, and to the vessels resorting to them
                            for legitimate trade. That in its original inception this doctrine never
                            included the idea that a vessel engaged in an unlawful voyage might
                            protect herself from capture, to which she would be subject on the high
                            seas, by merely skirting the coast of a harborless and substantially
                            uninhabited island, such as the island of Abaco. That although strictly
                            and technically the coast of such an island might be within the
                            protection of the rule, it was only technically so; and that where a
                            claim is set up for the protection of a vessel actually engaged in an
                            unlawful voyage, and claiming a capture otherwise lawful to be made
                            unlawful by reason of being within a marine league of the shore of such
                            an island, a judicial tribunal should require strict and conclusive
                            proof to bring the vessel within the technical rule, and to satisfy them
                            that the neutrality of the proprietary nation had been in fact violated.
                            That the burden of proof, therefore, devolved strictly and onerously
                            upon the claimants; and that on the evidence appearing in this case it
                            would be, unjust to resolve any doubts which the commission might have
                            in this regard in favor of the claimants.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                        <p>The Hiawatha was captured by the United States blockading fleet, in

                            in attempting to pass through the blockading fleet on an outward voyage
                            from Richmond, Va., for Liverpool. She was taken into the port of New
                            York, and vessel and cargo there libelled in the United States district
                            court, and condemned. (See report of the case in that court,
                            Blatchford’s Prize Cases, p. 1.) On appeal, first to the circuit court
                            and thence to the Supreme Court, the decree of the district court was
                            affirmed, the opinion of the Supreme Court being delivered by Mr.
                            Justice Crier, and a dissenting opinion being read by Mr. Justice
                            Nelson, in which Chief Justice Taney and Justices Catron and Clifford

                        <p>This was one of the first vessels captured during the war, and one of the
                            first upon the validity of whose capture adjudications were had in the
                            prize courts of both, original and appellate jurisdiction. In the
                            Supreme Court, where the case was argued in connection with those of
                            several other vessels captured about the same time, and involving to
                            some extent the same general principles, the question of the validity of
                            the blockade established under the President’s proclamations of 19th and
                            27th April, 1861, (12 Stat, at L., 1258, 1259,) and that of the
                            liability of the property of persons domiciled within the
                            insurrectionary States to capture on the high seas as enemy’s property,
                            were elaborately argued. The majority of the court sustained the
                            validity of the blockade and the right of capture of property of
                            citizens of the insurrectionary States upon the high seas as enemy’s
                            property. The minority of the court held “that no civil war-existed
                            between the United States and the States in insurrection till recognized
                            by the act of Congress of 13th July, 1861, (12 Stat, at L., 255;) that
                            the President of the United States does not possess the power under the
                            Constitution to declare war or recognize its existence within the
                            meaning of the law of nations, which carries with it belligerent rights,
                            and thus change the country and all its citizens from, a state of peace
                            to a state of war; that this power belongs exclusively to the Congress
                            of the United States, and, consequently, that the President had no power
                            to set on foot a blockade under the law of nations; and that the capture
                            of the vessel and cargo in this case and in all cases before us in which
                            the capture occurred before the 13th July, 1861, for breach of blockade
                            or as enemy’s property, are illegal and void, and that the decrees of
                            condemnation should be reversed, and the vessel and cargo restored.” (2

                                n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0187"/>to take cargo back to
                            Liverpool. She passed Hampton Roads, at the mouth of the James River, on
                            the 23d April, and arrived at City Point, the port of Richmond, a few
                            miles below that city on the James River, on the 29th April. She
                            completed the discharge of her outward cargo on the 10th May;
                            immediately commenced lading with her return cargo, (consisting
                            principally of tobacco,) and completed this lading on the 14th or 15th
                            May. On the 16th she weighed anchor and attempted to go to sea without
                            pilot or steam-tug, but was prevented by headwinds. On the 17th a tug
                            attempted to take her out of harbor, but was prevented by the breaking
                            of the tow-line. On the 18th she was taken in tow by another steamer and
                            towed down the river to within about twenty miles of Hampton Roads. From
                            this point she floated down with the tide toward the Roads, and on the
                            20th was boarded by an officer from a United States blockading vessel,
                            who endorsed upon her register this notice: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>President Lincoln’s proclamation establishing blockade of the ports of
                            Virginia was issued 27th April, 1861, (12 Stat, at L., 1259.) Under that

                            Bay and the James River was actually established by Commodore
                            Pendergrast, and a proclamation made of same on the 30th April. On the
                            8th May, Lord Lyons communicated to Mr. Seward a letter from the British

                                    they will not consent, as the ship came here expressly’ from

                            of the blockade, of which, of course, her owners could have had no
                            knowledge when they sent her out, and submitted the case for the

                            had been laden before receiving notice of the blockade; so that, if the

                                    it, which was that a license was given to all vessels in the

                        <p>The British consul at Richmond gave to the master of the Hiawatha, on the
                            15th May, a certificate stating that, according to the best information
                            attainable by him, the effective blockade at the mouth of the James
                            River began on the 2d May. After the capture of the vessel,
                            correspondence ensued between Lord Lyons and Mr. Seward, in which Lord

                            consideration of the United States Government, saying that it appeared

                            the blockade, and that his not having passed the blockading squadron
                            earlier was due to erroneous information or unavoidable detentions,” He
                            also called attention to the cases of the Haxall and the Octavia, and
                            expressed the hope that the Government of the United States would be
                            disposed to extend to the Hiawatha the same favor which had been shown

                                    nor do I ground my present application upon legal considerations
                                    at all. My desire is, in conformity with the learned judge’s own
                                    suggestion, to obtain relief for the owners of the Hiawatha by
                                    an appeal to the equity and indulgence of the Government of the

                        <p>In cases No. 400 and 401, the memorials failed to show the respective
                            claimants the owners of the portions of the cargo claimed by them, but
                            showed those portions respectively to be the property of one David

                        <p>In the case of Wm. T. Marshall, No. 402, the memorial showed that the
                            claimant was, at the time of the capture, domiciled in Richmond, Va.</p>
                        <p>Demurrers were interposed in those cases, specifying these respective

                        <p>In the case of McEwen’s executors, No. 452, the proofs showed the
                            testator domiciled at Richmond down to about the time of the capture;
                            but about that time, the proofs failing to show whether shortly before
                            or shortly after, he returned to the domicile of his nativity in Great
                            Britain, where he ever after remained until his death.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimants it was contended that, irrespective of the
                            strict rule of prize law applicable to the case of the Hiawatha, the
                            case was one where in “justice and equity" the claimants were entitled
                            to indemnity, being without intentional fault, and morally, at least,
                            innocent of any intention to violate the blockade, or do any illegal or
                            prohibited act; that the master of the vessel had used the utmost
                            diligence in lading his vessel within the time which he was informed he
                            was entitled to consume in lading it, and had been prevented from
                            reaching Hampton Roads within the time limited, by causes beyond his
                            control; that he ought not to be made to suffer for the accidents that
                            had deprived him of the services of a pilot and the aid of steam, nor
                            for the winds that retarded the progress of his ship to sea, nor by
                            reason of the master’s failure, in the emergency of an unexpected war,
                            to understand the exact legal significance of proclamations of the
                            President, and the legal consequences of blockade; that at the time of
                            the capture no war existed between the United States and the Confederate
                            States, by virtue of which the blockade of the confederate ports could
                            be lawfully established; that no such war could be taken as existing
                            until recognized by the act of Congress of 13th July, 1861; that
                            consequently the President had no power to set on foot a blockade of the
                            ports in question under the law of nations prior to the 13th July, 1861;
                            that the capture of the Hiawatha and her cargo, whether for breach of
                            blockade or as enemy’s property, was illegal and void; and that by the
                            terms of the President’s proclamation the vessel was entitled to a
                            warning indorsed on her papers by an officer of the blockading force,
                            and was not liable to capture except for an attempt to leave port after
                            such warning.</p>
                        <p>As part of his argument, the counsel for the claimant cited and adopted
                            the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson in “The prize cases,” (2
                            Black, 682.) He cited also the case of the Neptunus, (3 Rob., 110, 173;
                            and Medeiros vs. Hill, 8 Bing., 231.)</p>
                        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0191"/>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that, as a matter of
                            fact, war actually existed between the United States and the Confederate
                            States at and from the dates of the respective proclamations of blockade
                            by the President on the 19th and 27th April, 1861, Virginia having
                            seceded by ordinance of her convention on the 20th April, and having
                            actually and formally joined the Confederate States on the 27tk April.
                            That, war thus existing, the establishment of a blockade was within the
                            constitutional powers of the President as the chief executive officer of
                            the United States and commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy. That
                            certainly as to foreign nations his acts were to be regarded fully and
                            completely as the acts of the United States, and the establishment of a
                            blockade by him was its establishment by the nation. That the validity
                            of the blockade so established by him was unquestioned by the Congress
                            which met after the issuing of the proclamation, and while it was in the
                            course of enforcement; and that it was expressly legalized by the
                            statute of 6th August, 1861, which legalized and made valid the
                            President’s acts, proclamations, and orders, after the 4th March, 1861,
                            “respecting the Army and Navy of the United States * * with the same
                            effect as if they had been issued and done under the previous express
                            authority and direction of the Congress of the United States.” (12 Stat,
                            at L., 326.) That the validity of this blockade had been fully
                            recognized by the British government as well as all other foreign powers
                            as effectual and valid; citing the correspondence of Lord Lyons, above
                            recited, and Prof. Bernard’s “Neutrality,” &amp;c., p. 231 <hi
                                rend="italic">n</hi>. That the proclamation of the President did not
                            modify or assume to modify the law of blockade as held by the rules of
                            international law; and that it was only in case of a vessel innocently
                            approaching the blockaded port without notice, that she was entitled to
                            be duly warned off before becoming a subject of capture; citing on this
                            point the Columbia, 1 Rob. 156; the Vrow Judith, <hi rend="italic"

                            236. That the misapprehension of legal rights by the master of the
                            Hiawatha could not be taken into account as excusing his action in
                            attempting to pass out through the blockade after the expiration of the
                            time allowed him by the rules of international law, and by the specific
                            notice contained in the diplomatic correspondence above recited for that
                            purpose. And that the accidents by which the claimants attempted to
                            excuse the failure of the Hiawatha to leave within the permitted time
                            could not be held to make her departure lawful, or exempt her from
                            capture.</p>
                        <p>As to the argument of the claimant’s counsel in favor of the rights of
                            the claimant before this commission, under general principles of justice
                            and equity outside of and beyond the principles of international law as
                            held by the prize courts, the counsel for the United States held the
                            same general line of argument as above reported under the case of the
                            Sir William Peel, No. 243; and insisted that the fact of the Government
                                <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0192"/>of the United States having
                            remitted its lawful claims for its own reasons in the cases of the
                            Tropic Wind, the Octavia, and the Haxall, certainly could not be taken
                            as any reason for enforcing as matter of right the same generosity in
                            the case of the Hiawatha.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claims of Watkins &amp; Leigh,
                            No. 400, and of Dalgetty, Du Croz &amp; Co., No. 401, on the ground that
                            the ownership of the portions of the cargo claimed by them respectively
                            did not appear to be in them but in a citizen of the United States. They
                            also unanimously disallowed the claim of Win. T. Marshall, No. 402, it
                            appearing that he was permanently domiciled in the city of Richmond
                            within the enemy’s country.</p>
                        <p>It made awards in favor of the claimants for the vessel in Nos. 398 and
                            399, amounting to $25,369; and an award in favor of the executors of
                            McEwen, No. 452, in respect of McEwen’s portion of the cargo, for
                            $6,090; Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting from these three awards.</p>

                        <p>This vessel was captured on the 25th February, 1863, in the Atlantic
                            Ocean, off the Island of St. Thomas, taken into the port of New York,
                            and there libelled as prize in the United States district court. A
                            decree of condemnation passed in that court against both vessel and
                            cargo. (See Blatchford’s Prize Cases, 381,463, to 550.) An appeal was
                            taken to the Supreme Court, which court reversed the decree of
                            condemnation by the district court, except as to a small portion of the
                            cargo, found by that court to be contraband of war, and intended for the
                            ultimate use of the enemies of the United States, and belonging to the
                            claimants in cases Nos. 408, 409, and 411, and except also so much of
                            the remaining cargo of the Peterhoff as belonged to the owners of the
                            contraband goods thus condemned. The cause was thereupon remanded to the
                            district court by the Supreme Court, with directions to enter a decree
                            in conformity to the opinion of the Supreme Court. Pending the
                            proceedings in the prize courts, the vessel was taken by the authorities
                            of the United States, for the use of the government, under the statute
                            for that purpose above referred to under the case of the Granite City,
                            No. 377. The cargo was also sold by order of the district court, pending
                            the proceedings. On the remanding of the cause to the district court,
                            proofs <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0193"/>were there taken as to
                            the portions of the cargo condemned as contraband and its value, and as
                            to other portions of the cargo and their value belonging to the owners
                            of the contraband cargo, as to the costs of the captors chargeable
                            against the vessel, and as to the claimant’s costs chargeable against
                            the ship, and the condemned and uncondemned cargo, and these costs were
                            duly apportioned accordingly. The amount of the appraised value at which
                            the ship had been taken, less the costs charged against her, was pajd
                            over to her owners. The proceeds of the uncondemned cargo were also paid
                            over to their respective owners, less the proportion of claimant’s costs
                            against same, which costs were paid to the proctors of the respective
                            claimants, to whom they were, by the final decree, allowed. No complaint
                            appeared to have been made in the district court as to the allowance or
                            apportionment of the costs and charges, or in respect of the appraised
                            value at which the United States had taken the vessel; and no question
                            in respect of either of these matters was taken to the Supreme Court on
                            appeal. By stipulation of the counsel for the respective parties, all
                            the papers relating to the appraisal and taking of the vessel by the
                            United States were omitted from the apostles sent up to the Supreme
                            Court on appeal.</p>
                        <p>The claimants in No. 405 claimed about £21,000, besides interest, for the
                            alleged value of the vessel, over and above the appraised value at which
                            she was taken by the United States; and for freight and passage money
                            which they would have been entitled to receive, and costs and expenses
                            sustained by them.</p>
                        <p>The claimants in Nos. 408, 409, and 411 claimed about £6,000, besides
                            interest, the alleged value of their portions of the cargo condemned,
                            including prospective profits upon the sale of the same at Matamoras,
                            and their costs and expenses.</p>
                        <p>The claimants in the remaining cases claimed about £40,000, besides
                            interest, for the alleged value of their portions of the cargo,
                            including prospective profits on its sale at Matamoras, and their costs
                            and expenses respectively, less the respective amounts received by them
                            from the proceeds of the cargo.</p>
                        <p>The proofs showed that the Peterhoff sailed from London for the mouth of
                            the Rio Grande in January, 1863, the bills of lading of her cargo
                            specifying the same as destined for Matamoras, and to be taken from
                            alongside the ship at the mouth of the Rio Grande. Included in the cargo
                            were some thirty-two cases of artillery harness, a large quantity of
                            boots, described in the invoices as “artillery boots,” “men’s army
                            bluchers,” &amp;c.; and eighty bales of blankets described in the
                            invoice as “government regulation gray blankets.” Besides these
                            portions, which were held by the Supreme Court as belonging to the class
                            of articles “manufactured and primarily and ordinarily used for military
                            purposes in time of war,” and so contraband when destined to the use of
                            a belligerent; the cargo included large quantities of iron, steel,
                            nails, leather, and drugs, including 1,000 pounds of calomel, large
                            amounts of morphine, 265 <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0194"/>pounds
                            of chloroform, and 2,640 ounces of quinine, all goods in special demand
                            for the use of the confederacy. Much of the cargo was deliverable to
                            order. A package deposited with the captain by Mohl, one of the Texan
                            passengers, and which the captain testified he was told by Mohl
                            contained “white powder,” but which the mate testified appeared to be a
                            package of “dispatches,” was thrown overboard by order of the captain on
                            the boarding of the vessel by the captors. Other papers were at the same
                            time burned by the fireman by order of the captain. The firm of James I.
                            Bennett &amp; Wake, London, were the agents of, the Peterhoff, and the
                            cargo was mainly secured through them. A circular of this firm was
                            proved, dated 24th November, 1862, in which they notified their “friends
                            desirous of shipping to America” that they would dispatch a vessel to
                            the Bio Grande about 1st December; that the services of Mr. Redgate,
                            Lloyd's agent, an expert in cotton, and who had been a resident nearly
                            forty years in Texas and Mexico, had been secured, whose services would
                            “be of great value to shippers in respect to his local knowledge and
                            influence, as also as regards agency of the inland transit and landing
                            and shipping of goods and cotton.” And further, that "a Mr. Besbie, of
                            the Confederate States of America, holds a contract with that
                            Government, whereby he is to receive 100 per cent, on invoice cost,
                            payable in cotton * * * for any goods he may deliver into the
                            Confederate States,” the benefits of which contract he would share to
                            the extent of 50 per cent, with any houses that might feel inclined to
                            ship. The Mr. Redgate named in this circular was a passenger on the
                            Peterhoff at the time of her capture, and was a claimant for part of the
                            cargo and for damages by occasion of his capture and detention before
                            the commission. The Mr. Besbie, or Begbie, also named in the circular,
                            joined the ship at Plymouth, but suddenly left it at Falmouth. His name
                            was not mentioned by the master in his deposition <hi rend="italic">in
                                preparatorio</hi>, who alluded to him merely as “another passenger"
                            who “left at Falmouth.” Neither of the firm of Bennett &amp; Wake was
                            examined as a witness by the claimants before the commission, though
                            notice was given of the examination of Bennett, and proof was made that
                            he was within reach in London at the time of the taking of the testimony
                            for the claimants there, and the counsel appearing for the United States
                            on the examination demanded his production as a witness for the
                            claimants pursuant to the notice. Bennett &amp; Wake had contracted on
                            the 27th October, 1862, with Pile, Spence &amp;. Co., the owners of the
                            Peterhoff, for the laying on of a first-class screw-steamer to proceed
                            to the Bio Grande on freight; under which contract the Peterhoff was
                            dispatched, as named in the circular of Bennett &amp; Wake of 24th
                            November, 1862, above referred to.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States referred to and adopted the opinion of
                            the Supreme Court, (5 Wall., 28,) as part of his argument. He maintained
                            that the proofs before the prize court, especially strengthened as they
                            were by the proofs taken before the commission, fully sustained the <pb
                                n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0195"/>condemnation of the portion of
                            the cargo condemned by the Supreme Court as contraband, and in fact
                            sufficiently showed the pretended destination of the vessel and cargo to
                            Matamoras to be colorable. That if all the proofs now appearing before
                            the commission had been before the prize court, they would have fully
                            justified the condemnation of the vessel and the entire cargo. That in
                            any event, the capture of the vessel and taking her into port was
                            justified by the presence of the contraband on board, which was in fact
                            liable to condemnation as well as by the circumstances of the case,
                            fully establishing probable cause. That the evasions and falsehood of
                            the master, Jarmin, on his examination <hi rend="italic">in
                                preparatorio</hi>, and the spoliation of papers shown, of themselves
                            debarred the claimants from any award for costs or damages. That as to
                            the taking of the vessel by the United States at an appraisement below
                            her alleged actual value, and as to the alleged errors of the district
                            court in the apportionment of claimants’ costs upon that part of the
                            cargo not condemned in captor’s costs, those were matters as to which no
                            question was raised in the prize-courts, and for which those courts
                            afforded an ample remedy if any injustice was done in respect of them to
                            the claimants, or any of them, and that the claimants could not be heard
                            here for the first time to question the legality of the proceedings in
                            those respects. That as to the apportionment of the claimants’ costs,
                            this appeared to have been done not only without objection of the
                            claimants in the prize court, but on the application of their own
                            proctors and counsel. And as to the appraisement and taking by the
                            United States, everything in relation to these matters had been by
                            stipulation withdrawn from the consideration of the Supreme Court, thus
                            clearly implying the consent of the owners to the taking at the
                            valuation named.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimants, it was contended that the portions of the
                            cargo condemned by the decree of the Supreme Court as contraband were
                            not in fact contraband, not primarily designed for military use, and not
                            shown to be destined for the use of the enemies of the United States.
                            That the voyage of the vessel was lawful from one neutral port to
                            another, and that her capture, was wholly unjustified by any proof of
                            intent to violate the, blockade, or of unlawful conduct in any respect.
                            That the valuation at which the vessel was taken by the United States
                            Government was much less than her actual value, and that the United
                            States were justly chargeable with at least the sum of $30,000, on
                            account of this difference in value. That the apportionment of
                            claimants’ costs upon those portions of the cargo not condemned in costs
                            was unlawful. That the question of costs had already been settled by the
                            decree of the Supreme Court 5 and that the district court in charging
                            these claimants’ costs upon those parts of the cargo exempted from costs
                            by the decree of the Supreme Court, disregarded and violated that
                            decree.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed all the claims.</p>
                        <p>The steamship Georgia; Edward Bates, M. P., claimant, No. 429.</p>
                        <p>The memorial of the claimant in this case recited that the Georgia <pb
                                n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0196"/>was an armed vessel of the
                            Confederate States. That she came into the port of Liverpool on or about
                            the 2d May, 1864; was there disarmed and advertised for sale; and that
                            the claimant, on the 2d June, 1864, purchased her without any armament,
                            and paid for her in good faith the sum of £15,000 sterling, her full
                            value at the time of the purchase. That he immediately changed her
                            internal arrangements to fit her for use as a merchant steamer, and on
                            the 18th July, 1864, chartered her to the Portuguese government for a
                            voyage to Lisbon, Portugal, having spent a large sum of money in the
                            alterations and fittings to adapt her for carrying passengers and cargo
                            pursuant to the terms of the charter-party. That under the charter-party
                            the vessel was laden by the Portuguese government with coals for the use
                            of the vessel, and duly cleared at Liverpool on her voyage to Lisbon.
                            That while pursuing that voyage, “in a peaceable manner and in violation
                            of no law whatsoever,” she was unlawfully captured on the high seas by
                            the United States ship of war Niagara; was taken into the port of
                            Boston, there libelled in the United States district court, and
                            condemned as lawful prize. That an appeal was taken from the decree of
                            the district court to the Supreme Court of the United States, which on
                            the hearing affirmed the decree of condemnation. The claimant claimed an
                            award for £27,654, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>To this memorial the United States demurred as setting forth no valid
                            claim against the United States; in that the memorial showed the vessel
                            to have been an armed vessel of war of the so-called Confederate States
                            of America, which were, during the whole period of the transactions set
                            forth in the memorial, at war with the United States. That she entered
                            the neutral port of Liverpool in her character as such armed vessel of
                            war, and was there purchased by the claimant, her armament having been
                            first removed, with full know edge of her former character as such
                            vessel of war, belonging to a power at war with the United States. That
                            such purchase carried no title to the claimant as against the United
                            States, or as against their right to capture the vessel as a vessel of
                            war; and that her subsequent capture by the United States, as set forth
                            in the memorial, was a lawful and valid capture, and the vessel was
                            properly and lawfully condemned by the prize courts.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States submitted the case on demurrer on the
                            opinion of the Supreme Court, delivered on the affirmance of the decree
                            of condemnation (7 Wall., 32) and without further argument.</p>
                        <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel filed an argument in behalf of the
                            claimant, in which he contended that the doctrine held by the Supreme
                            Court, as establishing liability of the vessel to capture after her
                            disarmament and sale, was unsound and unsustained by the authorities
                            cited in the opinion. He cited and discussed the authorities cited by
                            the Supreme Court in its opinion, to wit: The Minerva, 6 Rob., 397; the
                            Baltic, 11 Moon’s P. C. R., 145; Story’s notes on the Principles and
                            Practice of Prize courts, 63; Wildman, vol. 2, p. 90; and contended that
                            these authorities <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0197"/>did not
                            sustain the conclusions of the Supreme Court on which the decree of
                            affirmance was based.</p>
                        <p>The claim was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                        <p>The Circassian was owned by Zachariah C. Pearson, of Hull, who had given
                            mortgages to the amount of £25,000 upon the vessel, which mortgages were
                            held by the claimant Barker, No. 432. He had also assigned her outward
                            freight to Messrs. Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., No. 433, by way of
                            security for indebtedness. The vessel sailed from Bordeaux, France, on
                            the 7th April, 1862, under the charter-party hereinafter recited. She
                            was captured by a United States cruiser on the 4th May, 1862, on the
                            high seas off the coast of Cuba, taken into the port of Key West, and
                            there libelled and condemned as prize. An appeal was taken to the
                            Supreme Court, which court affirmed the decree of condemnation, Mr.
                            Justice Nelson dissenting. The case is reported, with the dissenting
                            opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson, in 2 Wallace, 135 to 160.</p>
                        <p>The vessel was chartered by the owners 11th February, 1862, to “J.
                            Soubry, agent to the merchants of Paris,” being then on her way from
                            London to Cardiff, to proceed thence with all convenient speed to Havre
                            or Bordeaux, there to load; “and being so loaded, shall therewith
                            proceed to Havana, Nassau, or Bermuda, as ordered on sailing, and thence
                            to proceed to a port of America, and to run the blockade, if so ordered
                            by freighters,” the owners agreeing “not to cover more than half her
                            value, say £20,000, by insurance against war risk.” The rate of freight
                            agreed upon was $40 per ton, with 10 per cent, primage. The vessel was
                            loaded at Bordeaux, shipping receipts being given by the master in the
                            following tenor, (after specifying the merchandise shipped:) “Which said
                            merchandise I promise to convey in my said steamer (the dangers of the
                            seas, machinery, and all other unavoidable accidents excepted) to the
                            said port of Havana, there to receive orders for the final destination
                            of my said steamer, and there to deliver the same to Messrs. Brulatour
                            &amp; Co., or their order, (or to order generally,) he or they paying me

                            of affreightment,” given to Mr. Bouvet, one of the shippers, was found
                            among the papers of the vessel, the translation of which is as follows:

                            been stopped, and before she was boarded by the captors. The vessel was
                            captured, as above stated, on the 4th May, 1862. Five days previous to
                            the capture—on the 29th April, 1862—the city of New Orleans was captured
                            by the Navy and Army of the United States, under Admiral Farragut and
                            General Butler, and thenceforward continued in the possession of the
                            United States to the termination of the war. A proclamation was issued
                            by General Butler, dated 1st May, printed by some Federal soldiers in a
                            printing-office seized for that purpose, on the 2d May, and first
                            generally published in the newspapers of the city on the 6th May; which
                            proclamation declared, among other things, that “the city of New Orleans
                            and its environs, with all its interior and exterior defences, having
                            been surrendered to the combined naval and land forces of the United

                            of the United States, the major-general hereby makes known and proclaims
                            the objects and purpose of the Government of the United States in thus
                            taking possession of the city of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana.

                            United States held that the military occupation of the city was to be
                            considered as substantially complete from the date of this publication

                        <p>On the 12th May, President Lincoln issued a proclamation reciting the

                            ports, and that the blockade of those ports may now be safely relaxed
                            with advantage to the interests of commerce,” and declaring that the
                            blockade of those ports “shall so far cease and determine from and after
                            the 1st day of June next; that commercial intercourse with those ports,

                        <p>Barker, as mortgagee of the vessel, (No. 432,) claimed £23,200, besides
                            interest. Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., assignees of the outward freight,
                            (No. 433,) claimed £10,000, besides interest. The insurance companies
                            and underwriters (No. 444) claimed £52,636, besides interest, the value
                            of the cargo insured by them, abandoned by the owners, and paid for as
                            for a total loss. Of the cargo thus insured, portions to the value of
                            £11,503 were alleged to have been owned by British subjects and insured
                            by the claimants, British underwriters. The remainder of the cargo,
                            valued at £41,133, was admitted to have been owned by French merchants
                            residing at Bordeaux, though insured by British underwriters. On the
                            sale under the decree of condemnation the gross proceeds of the vessel
                            were $107,000, United States currency; the gross proceeds of the cargo
                            were $243,479.49 in the same currency.</p>

                                    was a real one; and that the question whether her voyage was to
                                    extend beyond Havana was an open question, not to be decided
                                    until her arrival there; so that her capture before reaching
                                    Havana could not be considered a capture in the course of a

                                    crossing the part of the sea which has been conquered by the

                                    or by penetrating there by force or stratagem and carrying off
                                    the vessel; and third, at the moment of attempting to go out,

                                    Circassian was unlawful on the high seas, even if her direct

                                    July, 1861, (12 Stat. at L., 258, 257,) was not only entirely
                                    distinct from, but inconsistent with the belligerent right of
                                    blockade, and that the former right accrued when the latter
                                    terminated, upon the capture and complete possession of the
                                    city; and that, under the municipal regulations instituted, or
                                    to be instituted, in such case, plainly no capture could be made
                                    on the high seas, those municipal regulations not operating
                                    extra-territorially; that the blockade having thus terminated by
                                    the capture of New Orleans, the right of capture of the
                                    Circassian, if it had existed until then, necessarily terminated
                                    with the termination of the blockade, the vessel no longer being
                                        <hi rend="italic">in delicto</hi>. That in regard to the
                                    claims of the insurance companies and underwriters in No. 444,
                                    those claims were the legitimate subject of reclamation before
                                    this commission, as well in respect of those portions of the
                                    insured cargo originally owned by French merchants as of those
                                    owned by British subjects; that upon abandonment and payment the
                                    title of the underwriters became absolute to all interest of the
                                    insured in the property, and to all right of reclamation in
                                    respect of the same, and that such title related back to the
                                    date of the insurance.</item>

                        <p>The counsel for the claimants presented manuscript opinions of doctors
                            Phillimore and Lushington, and other counsel, holding the capture of the
                            Circassian illegal on account of the lack of previous warning, as well
                            as upon the ground of the previous capture and occupation of New
                            Orleans. They also presented the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice
                            Nelson, in the case of the Circassian, (2 Wall., 155,) as a correct
                            exposition of the law applicable to the case, and cited the following

                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the voyage of the
                            Circassian was plainly undertaken with the purpose and intent of
                            violating the blockade; that she was under express contract with her
                            freighters to violate it, and was in the actual prosecution of the
                            voyage with that purpose and destination when captured, and was thereby
                            liable to capture and condemnation. (The Columbia, 1 Rob., 156.) That
                            having full knowledge of the existence of the blockade, and having
                            expressly undertaken its violation, no further notice or warning was
                            necessary to justify her capture.</p>
                        <p>That New Orleans, which had been fully and completely an enemy’s city,
                            and one of the enemy’s chief marts from the outbreak of the rebellion in
                            1861 to its occupation by the Army and Navy of the United States on the
                            29th April, 1862—five days before the capture of the Circassian— had not
                            been reduced to the fixed, stable, and assured possession of the United
                            States at the time of that capture. That the mere <hi rend="italic"
                                >possessio pedis</hi> of the city by the United States did not work
                            the instant termination <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0202"/>of the
                            blockade, but that reasonable time after the actual possession must be
                            allowed to determine whether the occupation was such a stable and
                            permanent one as to justify the opening of the port as a port of the
                            United States; That until such occupation was so established, New
                            Orleans still remained an enemy’s city as regarded the rights of
                            neutrals to trade there.</p>
                        <p>That time must be given after the actual occupation, reasonably
                            sufficient to put in force the municipal regulations of the United
                            States, with the apparatus of custom-houses and courts, through which
                            such municipal regulations were to be enforced; and that until
                            sufficient time had elapsed for that purpose, the belligerent right of
                            blockade continued; that the blockade of New Orleans was not a blockade
                            “by the simple fact only,” but “by a notification accompanied with the
                            fact;” and such blockade continued within reasonable limitation till
                            ended by like public notification. (The Neptune, 1 Rob., 170.)</p>
                        <p>That the time fixed by the Supreme Court in the case of the Venice (2
                            Wall., 259) as the date of the assured possession by the United States,
                            as determining the national character of the inhabitants of that city,
                            (6th May, 1862,) was certainly the earliest date which could properly be
                            assigned as that of assured possession by the United States for any
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>That, in fact, the time necessary to establish the permanence and
                            stability of possession, by the capturing belligerent, should fairly and
                            properly be left, within reasonable limits, to his own determination,
                            and that the date of 1st June, 1862, fixed by the President of the
                            United States by his proclamation of 12th May, (12 Stat, at L., 1263,
                            1264,) for the termination of the blockade, was within reasonable limits
                            under the rules of international law; and that that date (1st June)
                            should be considered the lawful and proper termination of the
                            blockade.</p>
                        <p>That, at the date of the capture of the Circassian, the city of New
                            Orleans, though in the actual occupancy of the United States forces, had
                            neither capitulated nor surrendered, but was still an enemy’s city,
                            deserted for the time by its garrison, but held only by an insignificant
                            force, and what its chief civic officer, still avowing the adherence of
                            the city to the confederate cause, called "the power of brutal-force,
                            not by choice or consent of its inhabitants.” (See letter of the mayor
                            of New Orleans to Flag-officer Farragut, 4 Reb. Rec, doc. 523, 524;
                            also, 2d Wallace, 141 <hi rend="italic">n;</hi> and Barton’s Butler in
                            New Orleans, 282, 342.) That the military occupation of the city of New
                            Orleans by the United States could not be extended by construction
                            beyond the lines of actual military occupation, and that the city of New
                            Orleans was not conterminous with the port of New Orleans as established
                            by the statutes of the United States, (9 Stat, at L. 458;) but that the
                            port which had been blockaded embraced territory outside the city, and
                            not within the lines of actual military occupation. That such occupation
                            of a portion only <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0203"/>of the port
                            could not be deemed, of itself, a termination of the blockade of the
                            port.</p>
                        <p>That the collection district of which New Orleans was the sole port of
                            entry, included the entire extent of the navigation of the Mississippi
                            River and its tributaries, covering thousands of miles of navigation,
                            and large cities situated upon that river and its tributaries, (2 Stat.
                            at L., 252; 4 <hi rend="italic">id.</hi>, 480.) That a large extent of
                            the country included within this district, and many important ports and
                            towns within it, were still in the undisturbed control and occupancy of
                            the enemy. That the blockade of New Orleans was in effect the blockade
                            of the Mississippi River, and that until the United States were in
                            Complete and assured possession of all the mouths of the river as well
                            as the entire port of New Orleans, the imperfect and perhaps transient
                            occupation of the city of New Orleans was not to be taken as terminating
                            the blockade.</p>
                        <p>That so far as the Circassian herself and her officers were concerned,
                            sailing with the direct purpose and destination of violating the
                            blockade, and without knowledge or notice either to them or their
                            captors of any change of occupation of New Orleans, such an accidental,
                            technical, and artificial objection to the rightfulness of her capture
                            should not be allowed to change the character of a capture otherwise
                            lawful, and convert it into an unlawful capture, without strict and
                            conclusive proof of the facts relied on so to change the character of
                            the capture.</p>
                        <p>That, as to the claim of the insurance companies, (No. 444,) they had no
                            standing before the commission in respect of the larger part of the
                            cargo insured by them, the same having been the property of French
                            merchants, not subjects of Her Britannic Majesty. That, by the terms of
                            the treaty, jurisdiction is given to the commission only of claims
                            “growing out of injuries to the persons and property of British
                            subjects.”</p>
                        <p>That the gist of the injury here complained of was the wrongful capture
                            of the Circassian and her cargo, the subsequent condemnation and sale
                            being merely incidents of the capture in the course of the adjudication
                            by the tribunals of the United States, as to its lawfulness, merely for
                            the purpose of determining whether the capture should be ultimately
                            adopted as the act of the United States. That, when captured, this part
                            of the cargo was not the property of the subjects of Her Britannic
                            Majesty. That the abandonment by the insured to the insurers after
                            capture, the acceptance of such abandonment by the insurers, and payment
                            as for a total loss, simply operated as a transfer to the insurers of
                            the rights of the assured in respect of the capture; and that the
                            insurers stood merely as subrogated to the rights of the owners at the
                            time of the capture, and as their equitable assignees. That such
                            transfer by operation of law gave to the insurers as equitable assignees
                            no better standing before the commission than they would have in case of
                            a claim for any other injuries to the persons or property of individuals
                            not subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, but who had assigned their claim
                            against the United States’ for such injuries to a British subject. That
                            so far, therefore, <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0204"/>as the
                            property of these “French merchants” on board the Circassian was
                            concerned, no right of reclamation against the United States under the
                            treaty existed in the claimants.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting) made awards in favor
                            of all the claimants. To the claimants in No. 432, the sum of $71,428,
                            in No. 433, the sum of $20,450, and in 444 the sum of $133,296. I am
                            advised that these respective sums in Nos. 432 and 444 were taken by the
                            commission as the actual proceeds of the sales of the vessel and cargo,
                            respectively, reduced from United States currency at its value at the
                            date of sale to a gold basis, and without the allowance of any interest.
                            The award in No. 444 covered as well the proceeds of the cargo belonging
                            to the French merchants as the portions owned by British subjects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Commissioner Frazer read a dissenting opinion, which will be found in
                            the Appendix N.</p>
                        <p>The schooner Jane Campbell; George Campbell, claimant, No. 453.</p>
                        <p>This vessel was captured by a vessel of the United States blockading
                            squadron in December, 1861, off the port of Beaufort, N. C. She was
                            taken into the port of New York and there libelled in the United States
                            district court. That court made a decree awarding restitution of the
                            vessel and certifying probable cause of capture, but finding upon the
                            evidence that the captors had been guilty of unjustifiable conduct
                            toward the crew and cargo and stores of the vessel in the matters
                            hereinafter named, ordered a reference to prize commissioners to
                            ascertain and report to the court the damages sustained in consequence
                            of such alleged misconduct. (The case is reported in Blatchford’s Prize
                            Cases, 107, 130.) Under this order no proofs were offered by the
                            claimants in the district court, nor any further proceedings had as to
                            such alleged damages; and no appeal was taken from the decree of the
                            district court.</p>
                        <p>The proofs in the prize court were not put in evidence before the
                            commission, but the claimant rested the case here on his own deposition
                            taken before the commission.</p>
                        <p>From the testimony of the claimant himself, it appeared that he was, down
                            to August, 1861, a resident of Petersburgh, Va.; that the vessel was of
                            American build and register, and was bought by him in July, 1861, in
                            Washington, N.C., a blockaded port of the enemy. He bought her for the
                            alleged purpose of taking his family from North Carolina to Liverpool;
                            and in August, 1861, took her out through the blockade, and subsequently
                            caused her to be registered as a British vessel. The district court
                            found, upon the proofs before it, that the vessel when captured was
                            apparently approaching the blockaded port of Beaufort, N. C., with
                            intention to enter it. The claimant alleged in his memorial, and stated
                            in his deposition, that he was on a voyage from Liverpool to Havana;
                            that he was compelled by stress of weather and injuries received to seek
                                <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0205"/>assistance off the coast of
                            North Carolina, and approached the blockading fleet for that purpose,
                            making known his condition, but his vessel was thereupon seized and sent
                            in for libel. The memorial also alleged, and the prize court found upon
                            the evidence before it, that on the capture of the vessel the claimant,
                            who’ was on board of her, was, with some of the ship’s company, taken
                            from the schooner, placed on board a United States vessel, and carried
                            to Fortress Monroe and there landed, while the vessel, with her captain
                            and the remainder of her cargo, was taken to New York, and that the
                            prize crew, while on board, broke open the hatches and the store-room
                            and appropriated portions of the cargo and stores. The memorial claimed
                            damages for the detention of the vessel and the injuries to the cargo
                            and stores, £3,260, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>The claimant assigned in his memorial, and in his deposition, as the
                            reason of his omission to make proof of his damages in the district
                            court, and to appeal to the Supreme Court, that he was informed by the
                            assistant district attorney of the United States that if he persisted in
                            the prosecution of his claim for damages, the United States would appeal
                            from the judgment of restitution rendered by the district court; and
                            that knowing that this course would probably keep his property locked up
                            for years, and not being in a position to bear such a loss, he took away
                            the vessel and cargo without any further prosecution of his claim for
                            damages.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the purchase of
                            the vessel by the claimant within a blockaded port of the enemy, she
                            being at the time an enemy’s vessel, and the claimant at the time of the
                            purchase an enemy by domicile, and the subsequent taking her out through
                            the blockade, followed by change of domicile of the owner and of
                            registry of the vessel, did not change the character of the vessel from
                            an enemy to a neutral. That the purchase of a private merchant-ship of
                            the enemy by a neutral in time of war, when made in a neutral port, if
                            not <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> illegal, is always liable to great
                            suspicion, and demands proof of good faith and of payment of full
                            consideration. (3 Phill., 607.) That such sale when made in a blockaded
                            port of the enemy was absolutely void; and that if the facts of this
                            pretended sale had been made to appear in the prize court, the vessel
                            must there have been condemned as enemy’s property. That the claimant
                            had full opportunity to make proof and receive an award for his alleged
                            damages in the prize court; and that having voluntarily abandoned the
                            pursuit of his remedy there, he could not now be heard to make
                            reclamation before the commission. That the reason alleged by him for
                            his omission to prosecute his claim for damages in the prize court, made
                            his case no better. That the law-officer of the United States had an
                            undisputed right to say to the claimant, as he did in effect: "If you
                            choose to claim damages of the United States I shall take an appeal and
                            test the question of the right of condemnation in the appellate court;
                            but if you are willing to take the vessel without claim of damages I
                            will waive my <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0206"/>right of appeal,
                            and allow yon to depart with the vessel and cargo.” That the claimant’s
                            abandonment of the right thus given him to make proof in regard to the
                            misconduct of the captors rather than have the question of condemnation
                            reviewed on appeal, was clearly “an acknowledgment of the justice of the
                            sentence.” That by the claimant’s omission to produce before this
                            commission the testimony taken in the prize court, he was debarred from
                            alleging that the evidence in that court was insufficient to sustain the
                            decree certifying probable cause of capture.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>

                            was boarded by an officer of the United States steam-frigate Niagara,

                        <p>In consequence of this warning she abandoned her voyage to Savannah, and
                            went to New York, where it was alleged that she disposed of the cargo of
                            coal at a rate much less than it would have commanded in Savannah, and
                            took a homeward freight from New York of much less value than she would
                            have secured from Savannah. In fact, at the date of the warning no

                            commenced until the 28th May. The memorial claimed damages by reason of
                            loss on outward cargo, and on return-freight below that which she would
                            have earned from Savannah, and by detention of the vessel, £6,46013<hi

                        <p>The Monmouth (No. 315) sailed from Liverpool in March, 1861, with a cargo
                            of salt, under written instructions to proceed to Charleston and deliver
                            vessel and cargo to consignees there; and if that port should be found
                            blockaded, then to go to Savannah; and if he failed in getting a cotton

                            for Liverpool. She was boarded by an officer of the United States
                            steamship Niagara off Charleston Harbor, on the 12th May, and a warning

                        <p>The sailing orders of the Hilja were not put in evidence nor accounted
                            for, though it appeared that she sailed under written orders; nor was
                            any evidence adduced as to her alternative destination to Savannah,
                            except that of the claimant himself, examined on notice, who, after many
                            evasive and contradictory answers on cross-examination as to the
                            destination of the vessel, finally summed up his evidence in this regard
                            by saying: “I think I mentioned to him verbally that if freights were
                            better at Savannah he was to go there.” The claimant also testified that
                            he had, through Mr. A. E. Byrne, (claimant in No. 315,) had
                            correspondence with the British foreign office in respect to this
                            warning, off of his vessel, and that he had had like correspondence with
                            Her Majesty’s consul at Charleston, through Messrs. Robert Muir &amp;
                            Co., and that there had also been correspondence between Muir &amp; Co.
                            and himself, and between Henderson, the master of the vessel, (since
                            dead,) and himself; but none of this correspondence was either produced
                            or accounted for. No proof was made as to the avails of the return
                            freight from Pugwash, except the general statement of the claimant in
                            his deposition that “the whole voyage brought in a loss;” and on
                            cross-examination the claimant, when questioned as to his transactions
                            in connection with violating the blockade during the war, and furnishing
                                <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0208"/>aid to the confederate
                            government, declined to answer all” such questions.</p>
                        <p>It appeared that an actual blockade of the port of Charleston was
                            established by the presence of a sufficient blockading force, at the
                            dates of the respective warnings of the three vessels.</p>
                        <p>The three cases were argued and submitted together.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States, it was contended that the warning
                            entered upon the register of these vessels, respectively, so far as
                            applicable to any unblockaded ports, was without authority of the United
                            States, a clear error on the part of the officer giving the warning,
                            insufficient to preclude the further voyage of the vessels warned to any
                            unblockaded port, and had never been adopted or ratified by the United
                            States; that the case rested on the voluntary abandonment, by the
                            masters of the Monmouth and the Boyne, respectively, of their
                            alternative voyage to Savannah, upon an incorrect warning, unduly given
                            by an unauthorized officer of the United States, and that for such loss
                            no reclamation lay against the United States.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the Hilja, it was maintained on the part of the United
                            States that the proof showed no alternative destination to Savannah;
                            that the vessel was merely stopped from entering the blockaded port of
                            Charleston, to which she was destined, and that no loss whatever was
                            shown to have accrued to her, except that caused by her being prevented
                            from entering that port, and that no proof was made of actual loss even
                            in this respect; that the non-production, by the claimant Wilson, of the
                            correspondence with the British foreign office, and with the British
                            consul at Charleston, as well as his own correspondence with his
                            captain, Henderson, and his agents at Charleston, Muir &amp; Co.,
                            sufficiently indicated that the claimant then put his claim for
                            compensation solely on the ground of the illegality or insufficiency of
                            the blockade of Charleston, and that the pretended alternative
                            destination to Savannah was an afterthought, borrowed from the cases of
                            the Monmouth and the Boyne; that his own testimony, on which he rested
                            the case, was upon its face unworthy of credit.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the United States also claimed that in the case of an
                            award of damages in any of these cases, the anticipated earnings by
                            freights from Savannah, at high rates, could not be taken into account
                            as elements of the award. That such anticipated earnings were
                            speculative and illusory; that the evidence showed that the market at
                            Savannah, in respect both of sales of the outward cargoes, and of the
                            rate of freights, was exceedingly irregular and violent in its
                            fluctuations, and in effect a gaming market. That it could not be
                            assumed that the vessels could have secured return cargoes at Savannah
                            in season to leave within the time limited after the establishment of
                            the blockade there; nor that they could have secured such rates of
                            freight as were claimed in the respective cases; and that these claims
                            were of substantially the same nature of speculative and uncertain
                            prospective profits, which <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0209"/>were
                            rejected by the tribunal at Geneva, in the case of the claims for
                            anticipated earnings and profits of captured vessels, claimed before
                            that tribunal.</p>
                        <p>The commission in the case of the Boyne, (No. 216,) unanimously made an
                            award in favor of the claimants for $32,553.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the Monmouth, (No. 315,) they made an award in favor of
                            the claimants for $40,843; Mr. Commissioner Frazer dissenting on the
                            question of amount.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the Hilja, (No. 467,) the claim was disallowed; Mr.
                            Commissioner Gurney dissenting.</p>
                        <p>On the general question involved in these cases Mr. Commissioner Frazer
                            read an opinion, which will be found in the Appendix O.</p>

                        <p>In the case of Alfred Raoul Walker, No. 13, the claimant, a minor, by his
                            guardian, alleged that he was born in Charleston, S. C, his father being
                            at the time of his birth a British subject and resident at Charleston,
                            as Her Britannic Majesty’s vice-consul for that port and for the State
                            of South Carolina; that by the will of Mrs. Laurens, the claimant, in
                            May, 1858, became entitled to a legacy of $20,000, to be paid to him on
                            coming of age, and the interest to be applied to his support and
                            education. That the executors of Mrs. Laurens’s will having filed a bill
                            in the court of equity in the State of South Carolina, for the purpose
                            of obtaining the protection of the court in respect to the trusts
                            created by the will, made the claimant a party to the bill, and placed
                            the moneys belonging to the claimant under the will in the receivership
                            and under the control of the court; and that, under the protection of
                            the court, the moneys so belonging to the claimant were invested in
                            bonds of the Confederate States during the war. That “by reason of such
                            investment for the purposes of carrying on civil war, and by reason of
                            such civil war and rebellion, and by the act of the Government of the
                            United States in suppressing the said rebellion and restoring the
                            authority of the Federal Government,” the claimant’s moneys were totally
                            and irrecoverably lost. That the court in question was a tribunal of
                            competent power and jurisdiction to direct the investment and charge of
                            such moneys; and that “the civil war, through the act of the Government
                            of the United States, destroyed the investments.” The claimant claimed
                            an award for $20,000, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>A demurrer was interposed on the part of the United States to the
                            memorial, specifying, among other grounds, that the claimant was, by the
                            laws of the United States, a citizen of the United States, and so could
                            have no standing as a British subject under the treaty; that the alleged
                            wrongs were perpetrated, if at all, by the pretended courts and
                            authorities of the so-called State of South Carolina, while not acting
                            under or by the authority of the Constitution, laws, or Government of
                                <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0210"/>the United States, but
                            while in rebellion against the United States and at war with them, and
                            that for such acts the United States were not liable; that the claimant
                            alleged that the court of South Carolina was a court having jurisdiction
                            of the subject-matter and of the person of the claimant, and exercising
                            such jurisdiction; and that the claimant, by his guardian, voluntarily
                            submitted himself to such jurisdiction; that he did not allege the order
                            or decree of the court to have been fraudulently made, or its treatment
                            of the claimant’s property to have been exceptional; and that for such
                            action of a judicial tribunal, however erroneous; no claim could lie
                            under the treaty. That the allegation that the civil war, through the
                            act of the Government of the United States, “destroyed the investments
                            of the claimant,” formed no ground of claim against the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The case was submitted without argument, and the claim was unanimously
                            disallowed.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Edward Alfred Barrett <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The
                            United States, No. 18, the claimant, resident in England during the war,
                            alleged that in October, 1864, he purchased for a valuable consideration
                            and was still the possessor and absolute owner of a certain “cotton loan
                            bond” of the Confederate States of America, by which the Confederate
                            States bound themselves to pay to the bearer £200 sterling, with
                            interest at 7 per cent, per annum, semi-annually, on the 1st day of
                            March and the 1st day of September in each year, until redemption of the
                            principal at par. That the Government of the United States, in the year
                            1865, “seized all the public assets of the said Confederate States and
                            especially a very large quantity of cotton, hypothecated by the said
                            Confederate States government for payment of the said cotton loan, and
                            thus prevented those States from paying their cotton-loan bondholders.”
                            That in consequence of such seizure by the Government of the United
                            States, the principal of said bond remained unpaid, and no interest had
                            been paid thereon from the 1st day of March, 1865. The claimant claimed
                            damages £200 besides interest.</p>
                        <p>The memorial came to the hands of the agent of the United States on the
                            14th November, 1871. Though insignificant in amount, it involved a
                            principal of the highest importance; and it was understood that it was
                            presented as one of a large number of claims of the same character
                            already in the hands of Her Majesty’s agent, and involving claims
                            against the United States on account of debts of the late so-called
                            Confederate States to very large amounts. The agent of the United
                            States, believing the claim to be neither within the letter or spirit of
                            the treaty, and to be one which ought not to have been presented by Her
                            Majesty’s government to the commission, immediately sent to the
                            Secretary of State of the United States a copy of the memorial, with the
                            following letter: <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0211"/>

                                    herewith a copy of the memorial of Edward Alfred Barrett,
                                    yesterday filed with the Washington commission under the British
                                    treaty.</p>
                                <p>You will notice that it is based solely on an alleged liability
                                    of the United States for payment of the cotton loan (so-called)
                                    of the late Confederate States, (so called.) It is the first
                                    claim of this character which has been presented to the
                                    commission.</p>
                                <p>Believing such claims to be entirely outside the submission made
                                    by the twelfth article of the treaty, and that the Government of
                                    the United States never has consented to submit to arbitration
                                    any question of their liability for debts of this character, and
                                    that it is not within my province to discuss or consent to the
                                    discussion of the question of such liability before the
                                    commission, I beg to submit the case to you for specific
                                    instruction.</p>
                                <p>The questions involved seem to pertain more directly to the
                                    diplomatic relations of the two countries than to any mere

                        <p>I am advised that the Government of the United States thereupon
                            immediately, through Mr. Schenck, the minister of the United States at
                            the court of St. James, protested against the presentation of such a
                            claim as not within the terms of submission by the treaty, and requested
                            of the British government that the claim be withdrawn. This request not
                            having been complied with, the agent of the United States, under
                            specific instructions from the Secretary of State on the 9th December,
                            1871, filed with the commission a motion to dismiss the memorial for
                            want of jurisdiction, as stating no case for a claim against the United
                            States within the intent of the treaty. On this motion the agent of the
                            United States, on the 13th December, 1871, submitted a printed argument,

                                <p>By the twelfth article of the treaty the claims against the
                                    United States submitted to the adjudication of the commission
                                    are those of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, “arising out of
                                    acts committed against the persons or property of subjects of
                                    Her Britannic Majesty “during the time limited by that
                                    article.</p>
                                <p>This language is plain and unambiguous. It limits the claims to
                                    those technically known as “torts," and those “torts" committed
                                    against the “persons or property-” of the claimants.</p>
                                <p>It could not be contended that the claims so submitted would
                                    include a claim on contract against the United States, though
                                    founded directly on a contract duly executed by an authorized
                                    officer of that Government, and plainly violated by that
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>Much less can it be held to include a contract executed by and in
                                    the name of an <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0212"
                                    />insurrectionary organization, in violation of the Constitution
                                    and laws of the United States, seeking the subversion of that
                                    Government, levying war upon it, and finally suppressed by its
                                    power.</p>
                                <p>Notwithstanding the specious attempt to disguise the true nature
                                    of this claim under an allegation of the destruction by the
                                    United States, in war, of property “hypothecated” by the
                                    so-called Confederate States for the security of their debts, it
                                    is really neither more nor less than a claim to hold the United
                                    States liable for the debts of those lately in rebellion against
                                    them, contracted in the very course of such rebellion, in aid of
                                    it, and from which it drew its chief support.</p>
                                <p>To believe for a moment that the United States ever intended to
                                    submit such a question to arbitration would be, at the same
                                    time, to do violence to the language of the treaty, and to
                                    falsify the history of that Government by imputing to it a
                                    pusillanimity wholly unwarranted by anything in its past career
                                    or present condition. It would be to believe that the United
                                    States have deliberately signified their willingness, at the
                                    award of this commission, to pay debts contracted by their
                                    defeated enemies, for the sole purpose of the dismemberment of
                                    their Government and the destruction of their liberties; debts
                                    held in the deepest abhorrence by the unanimous sentiment of
                                    their loyal people, and debts, the assumption or payment of
                                    which, in any form, by the United States, or anyone of their
                                    constituent States, has been prohibited by solemn constitutional
                                    enactment, by that fundamental law to which all treaties, as
                                    well as all statutes; are subject.</p>
                                <p>When the Government and people of the United States shall
                                    acknowledge that in their recent successful struggle with
                                    rebellion they were wholly in the wrong, and the rebels wholly
                                    in the right; when they shall determine to compensate the rebels
                                    themselves for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> losses in person and
                                    property by the war, to pension <hi rend="italic">their</hi>
                                    widows and orphans, and to repudiate the debt of the Federal
                                    Government contracted for the <hi rend="italic">suppression</hi>
                                    of the rebellion; then, and not till then, will they consider
                                    the question of paying the mercenary foreign subscribers to the
                                    rebel loans, more criminal in their eyes, or at least sharing
                                    more of their abhorrence, than any other participants in the
                                    gigantic crime.</p>
                                <p>The language of the treaty itself is believed to be abundantly
                                    specific in excluding claims of the character of that in
                                    question. If any ambiguity could be found in that language, it
                                    would be fully removed by reference to the protocols of
                                    conference of the Joint High Commissioners, and to facts of
                                    universal cognizance in connection with them.</p>
                                <p>By the 36th protocol, under the head of “Articles XII to XVII,”
                                    it appears that the American commissioners, when invited by
                                    their British colleagues to include within the terms of the
                                    treaty another class of claims by Her Majesty’s subjects against
                                    the United States, declined so to do, saying, “That, in their
                                    view, the subject was not embraced in the scope of the
                                    correspondence between Sir Edward Thornton and Mr. Fish under
                                    either of the letters of the former; and that they did not feel
                                    justified in entering upon the consideration of any class of
                                    claims not contemplated at the time of the creation of the
                                    present commission," &amp;c.</p>
                                <p>Referring to the correspondence between Sir Edward Thornton and
                                    Mr. Fish, named in the protocol, it will be found that the first
                                    mention of or reference to the claims covered by the twelfth
                                    article, is contained in the letter of Sir Edward to Mr. Fish,
                                    under the date of February 1, 1871, and that in that letter he
                                    designates them as claims “arising out of acts committed,”
                                    &amp;c, the same language which was subsequently copied into the
                                    treaty, and, with the addition, by way of giving greater point
                                    and accuracy, of the further words, “against the persons or
                                    property of subjects of Her Britannic Majesty.”</p>
                                <p>It must be borne in mind that at the time of this correspondence,
                                    as well as at the time of the conclusion and ratification of the
                                    treaty, the Constitution of the United States contained an
                                    express prohibition of the assumption or payment of these debts
                                    by the United States or by any State. That every officer of the
                                    United States, executive, <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157"
                                        facs="0213"/>legislative, and judicial, was thus bound by
                                    the supreme law of the land and by his oath of office to treat
                                    as utterly null any provision of any treaty or statute in
                                    contravention of that constitutional prohibition, under penalty
                                    of impeachment or its equivalent. That the existence of this
                                    constitutional provision was well known, not only to the
                                    Secretary of State, the Commissioners, the Chief Executive, and
                                    the Senate of the United States, all parties on the part of the
                                    United States to the treaty or to this preliminary
                                    correspondence, but was equally well known to the British
                                    minister and to the British High Commissioners. It cannot,
                                    therefore, be for a moment believed that the American Secretary,
                                    in his acceptance of the proposition of Sir Edward by his letter
                                    of February 3—the President of the United States, in directing
                                    that acceptance—the American members of the Joint High
                                    Commission in negotiating and concluding the treaty—the
                                    President in ratifying, or the Senate of the United States in
                                    advising and consenting to the same—ever intended to embody in
                                    it a provision which should violate the fundamental law of the
                                    nation, or that the ministers and commissioners of Her Britanic
                                    Majesty so understood them to intend.</p>
                                <p>In case, too, of any possible ambiguity, it must be borne in mind
                                    that this language first emanated from Her Majesty’s minister,
                                    and that by the settled rules of diplomatic as well as legal
                                    construction, the party employing ambiguous language is debarred
                                    from any benefit of the ambiguity.</p>
                                <p>But the United States insist that the language is not ambiguous;
                                    that it is plain and explicit, and that within it a claim of
                                    this character has no place among the matters submitted by the
                                    treaty to this commission for its decision.</p>
                                <p>The undersigned is warranted in saying that the words “arising
                                    out of acts committed,” were deliberately and intentionally
                                    inserted by Sir Edward in his letter of 1st February, repeated
                                    by Secretary Fish in his letter of 3d February, and copied and
                                    elaborated by the Joint High Commissioners in the twelfth
                                    article of the treaty, for the express purpose of excluding all
                                    possible claims of the nature of the debts of the States lately
                                    in rebellion, singly or under any attempted and abortive
                                    organization.</p>
                                <p>If the counsel for the United States deemed himself at liberty to
                                    discuss the merits of the claim here presented, as within the

                                <p>The commission is of opinion that the United States is not liable
                                    for the payment of debts contracted by the rebel
                                    authorities.</p>
                                <p>The rebellion was a struggle against the United States for the
                                    establishment in a portion of the country belonging to the
                                    United States of a new state in the family of nations, and it
                                    failed. Persons contracting with the so-called Confederate
                                    States voluntarily assumed the risk of such failure and accepted
                                    its obligations, subject to the paramount rights of the parent
                                    state by force to crush the rebel organization and seize all its
                                    assets and property, whether hypothecated by it or not to its
                                    creditors. Such belligerent right of the United States to seize
                                    and hold was not subordinate to the rights <pb n="158"
                                        xml:id="pg_158" facs="0214"/>of creditors of the rebel
                                    organization created by contract with the latter; and when such
                                    seizure was actually accomplished it put an end to any claim to
                                    the property which the creditor otherwise might have had.</p>
                                <p>We are therefore of opinion that after such seizure the claimant
                                    had no interest in the property, and the claim is dismissed.</p>

                        <p>In view of the attitude taken by the British government upon the
                            presentation of the claim for so-called indirect damages in the “Case"
                            of the United States before the tribunal of arbitration at Geneva, and
                            of the intense feeling manifested by the British nation through the
                            press and in parliament and elsewhere on that subject, I have deemed
                            this case worthy of specific and full report. The case involved in
                            principle the question of the liability of the United States for the
                            entire debt of the late Confederate States. If within the jurisdiction
                            of the commission, if was plain that the United States might, by the
                            decision of the commission, be held liable for so much of that debt as
                            was held at the termination of the war by British subjects, the amount
                            of which is of course a matter of conjecture merely, but which doubtless
                            amounted to many hundred millions of dollars. It is impossible to
                            believe that the Government of the United States could ever have
                            designed to submit the question of such liability to arbitration; and it
                            is certain that the people of the United States would never have
                            consented to the submission in any form of such a question to
                            arbitration, or to any measures of which the possible result might be to
                            charge them with the payment of the debt of the Confederate Stated or
                            any part of such debt. It is difficult to see why the presentation of
                            such a claim to the commission, and the claim made by such presentation
                            that the commission had jurisdiction under the treaty to make an award
                            against the United States on account of this vast debt of their late
                            enemies, the payment of which in any form had been prohibited by
                            constitutional enactment, might not naturally and properly have produced
                            among the people of the United States quite as intense an excitement,
                            and quite as earnest and vigorous demonstrations of hostility to such
                            submission as were manifested by the people of Great Britain in respect
                            of the claims for indirect damages at Geneva. It is, however, worthy of
                            note that during its pendency before the commission, the fact of the
                            presentation of such a claim was not even in the public press or in
                            Congress or in any other manner brought to popular notice, and no angry
                            demonstrations were anywhere made in relation to it.</p>
                        <p>The disposition of the case before the commission, both in substance and
                            form, seems to have been entirely satisfactory to both nations; and an
                            analogy may perhaps be noted between the manner in which the commission
                            disposed of this claim, and that subsequently adopted by <pb n="159"
                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0215"/>the tribunal at Geneva in respect to
                            the claims for the so-called indirect damages.</p>
                        <p>In the case of William Adam, (No. 72,) the claimant, a British subject
                            domiciled in England, alleged that he was, in 1862, the owner of certain
                            bonds of a railroad company within the United States, amounting to
                            $5,000 principal, with interest, payable half yearly, at six per cent,
                            per annum, the interest upon which had been regularly paid in specie up
                            to the 31st December, 1861. That in the year 1862, the Congress of the
                            United States passed a law making paper money a legal tender without any
                            protection to pre-existing contracts; and that immediately after that
                            law the paper money of the United States became depreciated in value,
                            and the claimant was thenceforward compelled to receive payment of his
                            interest in such depreciated currency, and that the bonds themselves and
                            the prospective interest to become due thereon, had likewise become
                            depreciated in consequence of the same legislation. That the Supreme
                            Court of the United States had, in 1871, adjudged the act of 1862 valid
                            in its application to pre-existing debts. He submitted with his memorial
                            a computation of his losses in the premises, and claimed’ damages
                            $3,309, besides interest. A demurrer was interposed to the memorial on
                            behalf of the United States, on the ground that it stated no case within
                            the jurisdiction of the commission, and no facts showing any liability
                            for compensation to the claimant.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously made an award as follows: <quote

                        <p>In the case of Joseph W. Roach, No. 154, the claim was for the value of
                            the brigantine Madeira and her cargo, which was alleged to have been, on
                            the 3d October, 1863, run into by the Clyde, a steamer transport owned
                            by the United States, and the vessel and her cargo thereby sunk and
                            totally lost. That the collision took place in the course of a lawful
                            voyage of the Madeira from the port of Saint John’s, Porto Rico, to the
                            port of New York; and that the Clyde was then upon a voyage for the
                            Government of the United States, and under the charge of officers of
                            that Government. That the collision happened entirely through the
                            neglect and default of the officers of the Clyde. The memorial claimed
                            damages $14,969.50, besides interest. The proofs filed sustained the
                            allegations in the memorial as to the loss of the vessel and cargo by
                            the default of the officers of the Clyde, and showed that the matter had
                            been investigated by the claims commission of the War Department, and a
                            report was made by that commission in January, 1867, assessing the
                            damages of the claimant at $11,373.98, besides interest. The only
                            question raised in the case was as to the amount of damages to be
                            allowed. The commission unanimously awarded the claimant $14,081.</p>

                        <p>Claim of William Scott Millar, No. 157. The memorial in this case alleged
                            that the claimant, a British subject domiciled at New Orleans, was, on
                            the 25th September, 1864, the owner of 330 bales of cotton, then worth
                            $223,253. That on that day the cotton was unlawfully seized and taken
                            from his possession by a supervising special agent of the United States
                            Treasury Department, and was proceeded against for forfeiture to the
                            United States, by libel of information filed in the United States
                            district court for the district of Louisiana. That the claimant appeared
                            in that suit, and claimed restitution of the cotton, but that it was
                            detained till December, 1864, when it was surrendered to him upon the
                            execution of a bond by him with sureties to the United States,
                            conditioned to abide the decree of the court upon the libel. That
                            between the date of the seizure and the date of the release the cotton
                            largely depreciated in value, and the claimant was also compelled to pay
                            large sums by way of costs. Damages were claimed by reason of the
                            depreciation in value and the costs paid, $90,145, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>The proofs showed that the cotton in question was purchased at points
                            within the confederate military lines in the State of Mississippi, under
                            alleged permits issued by a special agent of the United States Treasury
                            Department, and was seized on its way through those military lines and
                            into the territory held by the United States forces. The district court
                            dismissed the libel for confiscation with costs. No claim for damages by
                            reason of the seizure appeared to have been interposed by the claimant
                            in that court, and no damages were there awarded him.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the claimant it was contended that the decree of acquittal
                            by the district court without certificate of probable cause conclusively
                            established the seizure as wrongful. That the United States were
                            responsible for the seizure as made by an authorized agent of the
                            Treasury Department in the line of his duty and under color of acts of
                            Congress. And that the act of the agent in making the seizure had been
                            expressly adopted by the Government by instituting proceedings for the
                            forfeiture of the property. The counsel for the claimant cited Gelston

                        <p>On the part of the United States it was maintained that the proofs
                            conclusively showed the purchase of the property by the claimant within
                            the enemy’s lines, and his attempted transportation of the same through
                            those lines into the Federal jurisdiction, to have been illegal and not
                            warranted by his permits; that the cotton should have been condemned by
                            the district court; that the decree of that court was not conclusive
                            against the United States upon the claim now preferred for damages, and
                            that the commission were entitled to look into the proofs and adjudicate
                            upon the question of the liability of the United States for damages as
                            an original question; that the claimant might have presented and
                            prosecuted his claim for damages against the United <pb n="161"
                                xml:id="pg_161" facs="0217"/>States in the district court in the
                            action brought against him for forfeiture, and might there have
                            recovered his damages if lawfully entitled to the same and that until he
                            had exhausted his remedy before the tribunals of the United States, he
                            had no standing to make reclamation before the commission. The
                            commission unanimously disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>Amos Bigland’s claim, No. 199, was for damages for the detention of the
                            British steamship Tubal Cain, in the port of “New York, from the 8th
                            April to the 16th July, 1863, one hundred days; and damages were
                            claimed, $38,378, besides interest. The claimant was a British merchant
                            domiciled in the city of New York. He chartered the Tubal Cain to one
                            Mora for a voyage to Matamoras <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Havana and
                            back to New York. She was loaded by the charterer, and on the 8th April,
                            being ready to sail, clearance was refused by the custom-house
                            authorities, and she was seized by the United States authorities, the
                            collector of the port and the military commander of the department
                            concurring in the seizure, on the charge that she was undertaking to
                            carry on an illicit voyage between New York and the blockaded ports of
                            Texas, and was carrying out contraband of war destined for the
                            confederacy, and was also carrying passengers engaged in contraband
                            trade with the enemy, one of them being an agent of the Confederate
                            States government engaged in the purchase of munitions of war. Mr.
                            Edwards Pierrepont, of New York, was commissioned by the War Department
                            to examine and report upon the case. On the 26th May he made his report,
                            sustaining in substance the charges named as to two passengers, Blum and
                            Sutton, whom he found having contraband goods on board intended for the
                            Texas trade, and engaged in the service of the enemy; but reported that
                            neither the owner or charterer of the vessel had knowledge that any of
                            the goods shipped were contraband of war or were intended for illegal
                            trade. He further reported that there was reasonable cause for detaining
                            the vessel, but recommended that the vessel be discharged from custody,
                            and the goods be delivered up to the owners on their application and
                            receipt for the same. The report was approved by the Solicitor of the
                            War Department, and the vessel was surrendered on the 16th July and her
                            cargo returned to the shippers, with the exception of the goods of Blum
                            and Sutton.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the refusal to
                            clear the vessel, her detention for examination, and the unlading of her
                            cargo for that purpose, were lawful acts; that they were done under the
                            authority of the regular custom-house officials of New York, and that
                            the fact that those officials were aided by the military authorities in
                            no respect affected the character of the transaction; that the facts of
                            the case were such as in a prize court would have certainly justified
                            the capture as one by “probable cause “if the vessel had been captured
                            on the high seas and brought into port and libelled as prize; that the
                            same <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0218"/>principles were to be
                            applied in the consideration of this case of detention, and that no
                            liability existed against the United States on account of it.</p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously made an award in favor of the claimant for
                            $4,800. I am advised that this award was made in respect only of the
                            detention of the vessel, between the date of Mr. Pierrepont’s report and
                            her final discharge, the commission holding that detention
                            unreasonable.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Thomas Grant, No. 211, the claimant, in addition to his
                            claim for tobacco, captured in running the blockade from Wilmington,
                            before reported, claimed $7,000 damages for the alleged breaking up of
                            his lawful business as a manufacturer of tobacco by the “terrific
                            shelling of the city of Petersburg,” by the United States forces in 1864
                            and 1865, “which was so violent at times, during the period of ten
                            months, that no business could be regularly and successfully conducted
                            within the city limits.” He also claimed the further sum of $1,440 for
                            his interest in a quantity of tobacco, which he alleged was lost in
                            South Carolina while in the course of transportation to remove it out of
                            the reach of the Federal Army under General Sherman. It was not alleged
                            that the loss was caused by the United States forces except as the
                            remote cause of the removal. On demurrer the commission unanimously
                            disallowed the claim.</p>
                        <p>In the case of William Cleary, No. 220, the claimant, among other claims
                            set up in his memorial, claimed $5,000 damages for an alleged violent
                            assault, wounding, and ill treatment committed upon him by a private
                            soldier of the United States Army, at Savannah, in March, 1865, by which
                            he alleged that his life was endangered and himself disabled for some
                            months. No allegation or proof was made connecting any officer of the
                            United States, or any other person except the assailant, with the
                            alleged assault. The commission made an award in favor of the claimant
                            in respect of property taken for the use of the United States, but gave
                            nothing on account of the alleged assault.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Sheldon Lewis, No. 287, the claimant alleged that, in
                            March, 1863, he was the owner of the bark Matilda A. Lewis, on which
                            vessel was laden in that month a quantity of fowls destined for Havana.
                            That the officers of the United States refused to permit the vessel to
                            leave with the fowls, and took possession of them. That subsequently the
                            consignee of the fowls in Havana brought suit against the vessel in the
                            United States district court for the southern district of New York for
                            the value of the fowls, and recovered judgment for $1,100, for which
                            amount, with the additional sum of $600 costs expended by him, the
                            claimant claimed an award.</p>
                        <p>It appeared from the evidence that, by order of the Secretary of the
                            Treasury of 19th May, 1863, officers of the custom-houses of the United
                            States were directed to refuse clearances for the exportation of
                            “horses, <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0219"/>mules, and
                            live-stock,” and to cause the detention of all animals attempted to be
                            so exported. That the fowls in question had been shipped by one Glas
                            upon the vessel for Havana; that the customs officers in New York
                            construed the order of the Secretary of the Treasury as covering fowls,
                            refused to grant clearance for them, and ordered them to be relanded.
                            The fowls were relanded and delivered to the shipper, and the charterer
                            of the vessel having produced to Glas one of the triplicate bills of
                            lading, Glas signed a memorandum on same, annulling the bill of lading.
                            Meantime Glas had procured from the agent of the consignees at New York
                            an advance of $700, on one of the triplicate bills of lading for the
                            fowls. This fact was not disclosed to the charterer when the bill of
                            lading was cancelled by Glas. The consignee subsequently brought suit
                            against the vessel and recovered on the ground of his advance made to
                            Glas upon the bill of lading, and that the surrender of the fowls by the
                            charterer to Glas, and the cancelling of the bill of lading by Glas did
                            not prejudice his rights, and that the order prohibiting the exportation
                            of live-stock was unlawful, and that if lawful it was not intended to
                            include fowls. (See report of the case Desvernine v. The Bark Matilda A.
                            Lewis, 5 Blatchford’s C. C. R., 520 to 523.) In a like case,
                            subsequently brought to the notice of the Secretary of the Treasury, and
                            involving the construction of the order of 19th May, 1863, the Secretary
                            held that the order did not cover poultry.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the construction
                            placed by the custom-house officers upon the order of the Secretary of
                            the Treasury was evidently an unjust and forced construction; that if
                            application had been made at once to the Secretary of the Treasury, the
                            decision of the customs-officers at New York would have been overruled,
                            and that the United States were not responsible for the error of
                            judgment of such subordinate officers till proper resort was had to some
                            responsible and chief officer of the Government, whose decision upon the
                            question might bind the Government. Also, that if the United States were
                            liable for the wrongful acts of the customs-officers, the claimant was
                            in no position to maintain this claim; that the charterer of his vessel
                            had wrongfully allowed the fowls to be returned to Glas, the shipper, on
                            his cancellation of one of the bills of lading, without calling in the
                            others, upon one of which the advance of the consignees had already been
                            made; that the owner of the vessel had therefore been made liable solely
                            by the default of his charterer, by whose acts certainly the United
                            States could not be prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>The commission made an award in favor of the claimant for $1,819: Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. A. E. Campbell &amp; Co., claimants in No. 290, claimed from the
                            United States $25,881, besides interest, the alleged value of a cargo of
                            sugar on board the brig John Welch, which brig was alleged to have been
                            captured by the privateer Jeff. Davis, and carried into Charleston, S.
                            C, where her cargo was sold, but the proceeds of the claimant’s portion
                                <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0220"/>of the same were held by
                            the confederate government, to be refunded to the claimants. The
                            memorial further alleged that, “in the month of February, 1865, the
                            United States troops took military possession of Charleston, S. C, and
                            seized the confederate treasury and all confederate property therein,
                            and shortly afterwards seized and took possession of all property,
                            whatsoever or wheresoever, belonging to or in the possession, custody or
                            control of the said Confederate States, including the proceeds of the
                            cargo above referred to.” The United States interposed a demurrer to the
                            memorial. On the argument of the demurrer, Her Majesty’s counsel, on
                            behalf of the claimant, urged that it was possible for the claimants,
                            under the allegations of the petition, to make out a case of property
                            taken by the United States, “by showing that the proceeds of their sugar
                            were kept separate and distinct from the funds of the confederacy, and
                            marked or noted as theirs, and thus remaining in specie were captured.”
                            That in such case they might be entitled to recover. On this ground the
                            demurrer was overruled by the commission. Subsequently the claimants
                            having failed to make any proof of such capture of their property in
                            specie, and appropriation of it by the United States, the claim was
                            unanimously disallowed.</p>
                        <p>The case of Barron, Forbes &amp; Co., No. 314. In this case the claimants
                            alleged that in the year 1845 one Andres Castillero, a Mexican citizen,
                            became the owner, under the mining laws of Mexico, of a valuable
                            quicksilver mine in California, then a part of the Mexican territory,
                            since known as the New Almaden mine That on the subsequent acquisition
                            of California by the United States they were notified of Castillero’s
                            title. That in 1846 and 1847 the claimants duly succeeded to the title
                            of Castillero. That by the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, between the
                            United States and Mexico, by which treaty Mexico surrendered California
                            to the United States, the faith of the United States was pledged that
                            property of every kind belonging to Mexicans should be “inviolably
                            respected.” That in March, 1851, the Congress of the United States
                            passed a law which in effect proceeded on the assumption that all
                            unoccupied land in California was public property, and which allowed
                            proof to be taken by alleged owners of the titles before commissioners
                            appointed for that purpose, with the right of appeal to the United
                            States courts, and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States;
                            thus casting upon the claimants onerous burdens in the establishment of
                            their lawful title. That this act was, in effect, a confiscation in
                            favor of the. United States of all landed property in California,
                            subject only to its being averted by such proofs; and was, “in its
                            spirit and effect, a violation of the rights of property, and an
                            infraction of the true intent and meaning of the said treaty.” That the
                            claimants filed their claim before the commissioners in California on
                            the 30th September, 1852, and that those commissioners, on the 8th
                            January, 1856, affirmed the claim of the claimants as to a portion of
                            the property, but rejected it as to the remainder, on the ground that
                            their title under the alleged grant, as <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165"
                                facs="0221"/>to the property in respect of which their claim was
                            rejected, was inchoate and imperfect at the date of the treaty of
                            Guadalupe-Hidalgo. That the United States appealed from, the decision of
                            the commissioners to a tribunal, composed of the circuit and district
                            judges of the United States sitting in California, under the statute;
                            which tribunal, in 1857, issued an injunction restraining the claimants
                            from further working the mine until the further order of the court. That
                            this tribunal finally, on the 18th January, 1861, rendered a decree
                            substantially confirming the decision of the original commissioners,
                            establishing the title of the claimants to a part of the property and
                            rejecting it as to a part. That from this judgment both the claimants
                            and the United States appealed to the Supreme Court of the United
                            States; which court, in the year 1863, rendered a final judgment
                            reversing that part of the decree which established claimants’ title to
                            a portion of the property, and dismissing claimants’ appeal as to the
                            other portion of the decree, and remanding the cause with direction to
                            dismiss the entire petition. The report of the case, in the Supreme
                            Court, is found in the second volume of Black’s Reports, page 17, under
                            the title of “The United States <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>.

                        <p>The memorial disclaimed all imputation of intentional wrong by the
                            Supreme Court of the United States, but alleged that their final
                            judgment was erroneous; and further alleged that, immediately after the
                            decision of the Supreme Court, an order was issued by the President of
                            the United States, to the United States marshal for California,
                            directing that the memorialists be ejected from their property, and that
                            it be placed in the possession “of an agent of the United States. That,
                            “while thus under pressure and duress, and threatened with eviction from
                            their property,” by the United States, the claimants gave a quitclaim of
                            their interest in the entire property to a Pennsylvania corporation—the
                            Quicksilver Mining Company—receiving for this conveyance the sum of
                            $1,750,000, and that their grantees had since remained in possession of
                            the mine, “undisturbed by any claim of the United States;" and had
                            received, and still continued to enjoy, a revenue of about $1,000,000
                            per annum from the mine. It also alleged various acts of unfairness and
                            oppression by the attorneys, agents, and officers of the United States
                            during the pendency of the litigation in the lower courts, before the
                            final appeal to the Supreme Court. The claimants claimed an award for
                            about $16,000,000, besides interest. A demurrer was interposed to the
                            memorial, on behalf of the United States, on the following grounds: <list>

                                    They became parties litigant before the Supreme Court, a
                                    judicial tribunal of the United States, in respect of lands
                                    lying within the United States, and in a case in which the court
                                    had unquestioned jurisdiction. Their rights were, as they
                                    themselves admit, honestly and fairly, but, (as they allege,)
                                    erroneously adjudicated there. Without awaiting eviction from
                                    the premises, they voluntarily parted with their entire claim to
                                    the lands, mining privileges, and all enjoyments and profits of
                                    the same; that if their grantees had been evicted from
                                    possession, the claimants could not be the parties to claim
                                    redress, having voluntarily surrendered all their rights; but
                                    their grantees had not been evicted; the whole estate with its
                                    vast revenues had continued to be enjoyed by the parties to
                                    whose enjoyment the claimants voluntarily ceded it.</item>

                            marshal in California to expel the claimants from their property,
                            constituted acts against the property of British subjects, bringing them
                            within the jurisdiction of the commission. That the conveyance by the
                            claimants to their grantees was a conveyance under duress of these acts,
                            and did not discharge the liability of the United States, except so far
                            as the amount received by the claimants from their grantees as
                            purchase-money might go to reduce the amount of their loss. That it was
                            within the jurisdiction of the commission to review the judgment of the
                            Supreme Court, and if found erroneous to award compensation to the

                            alleged, in effect, that the claimants were the owners of certain shares
                            in the Bank of Louisiana, at New Orleans, which shares paid large
                            dividends up to the year 1861; that at the close of that year, “in
                            consequence of the war in America between the Northern and Southern
                            States, and of the occupation of New Orleans and of the bank by General
                            Butler, the bank ceased to pay any dividend or bonus,” and the claimants
                            have never since been paid any dividends; that at the time of the
                            cessation of the dividends the shares were worth $31,200, but that since
                            that date they had been substantially valueless. The claimants claimed
                            $33,720, besides interest. On demurrer by the United States, the claim
                            was unanimously disallowed.</p>

                            <item>For 200 bales of cotton alleged to have been owned by the claimant
                                in July, 1864, at Fort Adams, Mississippi. This cotton was alleged
                                to have been seized by the United States military forces at Fort
                                Adams, in August, 1864, and 178 bales of it sent to New Orleans; the
                                remaining 22 bales he alleged were carried off by the teamsters who
                                tied fearing that their teams, as well as the cotton, would be
                                seized by the United States officers. The cotton brought to New
                                Orleans was, on its arrival, turned over with other cotton by
                                General Canby to B. F. Flanders, a Treasury agent of the United
                                States. The claimant brought suit against Flanders in a Louisiana
                                court to recover the cotton, which suit was afterwards discontinued
                                with other like suits brought by other claimants of cotton against
                                    <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0225"/>Flanders, on a

                                themselves, by which stipulation Hodges was entitled to 122 bales.
                                He claimed damages for the 78 bales which he failed to receive, and
                                for depreciation of price on the 122 bales received by him, and for
                                legal expenses incurred, to the amount of $106,850, besides

                                under an order of Major-General Banks, then in command there,
                                requiring that all cotton coming to New Orleans should pay a tax of
                                $5 per bale; sugar, $1 per hogshead, &amp;c., &amp;c. The claimant
                                alleged that he paid said taxes under protest to the amount of
                                $20,924, for which amount, with interest, he claimed damages.</item>

                                the United States, near Alexandria, La., in March, 1864, for which

                                of the naval and military officers in command of the district,
                                entirely and totally lost to your memorialist," and for which he

                                to have been stored by the memorialist in March, 1864, upon Old
                                River, in Point Coupee, Louisiana. The claimant alleged that he sent
                                a vessel in March, 1864, to remove this sugar and molasses, but that
                                the vessel was prevented by the United States gun-boat fleet from
                                landing and taking on board the sugar and molasses, and that in
                                consequence the sugar and molasses “were entirely lost to your
                                memorialist.” For this he claimed $35,175, besides interest.</item>

                            <item>The sixth claim was for a quantity of sugar, alleged to have been
                                purchased in March, 1864, by the claimant, from one Thorne, a
                                resident of Saint Martin’s Parish, La., where the sugar was
                                situated. The claimant alleged that he hired a United States
                                transport from the quartermaster of the United States Army, to whom
                                he paid the sum of $3,000, to bring out the sugar from the
                                plantation, where it was stored, to Brashear City, La., to be thence
                                transported to New Orleans. That 84 hogsheads of the 300 purchased
                                were brought out by said transport to Brashear City, where it was
                                seized by the United States authorities, and libelled in the United
                                States district court, but said libel was dismissed and the sugar
                                surrendered. The United States authorities, however, prohibited the
                                transport which the claimant had hired from returning for the
                                remainder of the sugar; and, in consequence of such refusal, he
                                alleged that the sugar was shortly afterwards destroyed by
                                confederate scouts. For his losses in this regard, he claimed
                                $81,565, besides interest.</item>

                            <item>The seventh claim was for a large quantity of cotton alleged to
                                have been purchased by the claimant in the States of Louisiana and
                                Mississippi, 1,000 bales of which he alleged to have been destroyed
                                by troops of the United States, and the remainder to have been lost
                                and destroyed through the negligence and default of the United
                                States authorities. Under this claim he claimed an award for
                                $580,000, besides interest.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>During all the transactions in question the claimant was domiciled in New
                            Orleans.</p>
                        <p>The questions arising in the case were, to a large extent, questions of
                            fact, the recapitulation of which here would be unprofitable. In regard
                            to most of the property set forth in claims 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, it was
                            contended by the United States that the claimant’s title was invalid, as
                            obtained by unlawful purchases from enemies of the United States of
                            property within the enemy’s country, in violation of the non-intercourse
                            statutes of the United States, and of the general laws of war. The
                            permits under which most of this property was alleged to have been
                            purchased were also claimed by the United States to have been irregular,
                            collusive, and fraudulent, issued in violation of law, and giving to the
                            claimant no right to trade within the enemy’s country.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the claim for payment of alleged illegal taxes, being the
                            claimant’s second claim, it was contended on the part of the United
                            States that the tax was a lawful one, imposed by the commanding officer
                            at New Orleans, while that city was governed solely by martial law, as a
                            condition for the carrying on of trade in that city; and its proceeds
                            properly applied to the relief of the poor of the city, with whose care
                            the military authorities were of necessity charged. That it was a tax
                            imposed upon all persons trading in the city without discrimination, and
                            voluntarily paid by the claimant in common with all other persons in
                            like situation in New Orleans. Various other questions in regard to all
                            the claims were raised and discussed by the respective counsel, but they
                            were mainly such as relate only to the special circumstances of the case
                            and the questions of fact involved in the evidence in relation to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The commission made an award in favor of the claimant for $34,150, Mr.
                            Commissioner Frazer dissenting. I am advised that this award was made
                            entirely in respect of the claimant’s first claim above recited, and of
                            the amount paid by the claimant to the United States quartermaster for
                            the use of the transport, as set forth in the sixth claim.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Peter Maxwell, No. 385, the memorial alleged that the
                            claimant, during the entire war, was a resident of Liverpool. That in
                            the year 1862 proceedings were instituted in the United States court for

                            situated in the city of Leavenworth, Kans., a State not in rebellion, on
                            the alleged ground that the claimant was a rebel in arms against the
                            United States. The only notice of the proceedings to the defendant <pb
                                n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0227"/>was a constructive notice by
                            publication pursuant to the statute. No appearance being bad by the now
                            claimant, a decree of confiscation of two of the lots passed by default.
                            As to the other two, the libel was dismissed.</p>
                        <p>The proofs before the commission clearly showed that the allegations in
                            the libel as to the claimant being engaged in the rebellion against the
                            United States were unfounded.</p>
                        <p>The commission made an award in favor of the claimant for $1,782.</p>
                        <p>Bailey &amp; Leetham, claimants, No. 386. The claimants were the owners
                            of the British steamship Labuan, which, on the 5th of November, 1862,
                            was in the port of New York laden with a cargo of merchandise destined
                            for Matamoras. On that day her master presented the manifest to the
                            proper officer of the custom-house at New York for clearance, but such
                            clearance was refused, and the refusal continued up to the 13th of
                            December, 1862, on which clay it was granted. The memorial alleged that
                            this detention was by reason of instructions received by the
                            custom-house officers from the proper authorities of the United States
                            to detain the Labuan, in common with other vessels of great speed
                            destined for ports in the Gulf of Mexico, to prevent the transmission of
                            information relative to the departure or proposed departure of a
                            military expedition fitted out by the authority of the said United
                            States. The memorial claimed damages for the detention $38,000, being at
                            the rate of $1,000 per day, the memorial alleging that on a former
                            seizure and detention of the same vessel, from February to May, 1862,
                            when libelled as prize, this rate of compensation for the detention had
                            been awarded to the owners by the district court of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the United States it was contended that the detention of
                            the Labuan, under the circumstances alleged in the memorial, was within
                            the legitimate and recognized powers of the United States; that it was
                            no infringement upon the rules of international law or upon any treaty
                            stipulations between the United States and Great Britain, and that it
                            gave no right of reclamation in favor of the claimants against the
                            United States; that the right of self-protection, by temporarily
                            refusing clearance to vessels through which information of great
                            importance in regard to military movements is likely to reach the enemy,
                            must be regarded as of necessity permissible to a government engaged in
                            war; that at the time of this detention important military movements
                            then in progress in connection with the occupation of New Orleans by the
                            Federal forces, including the dispatch of General Banks, with large
                            re-enforcements, to supersede General Butler in the command there, were
                            in progress, and made it of the utmost importance that these movements
                            should be carefully kept secret from the rebels; that the detention of
                            the Labuan was not by any discrimination against her as a British
                            vessel, or against British vessels as such. All vessels capable of such
                            a rate of speed as to make their departure <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172"
                                facs="0228"/>dangerous in this regard were detained alike. That no
                            claim had ever been made by the British government, through the usual
                            diplomatic channels, upon the United States for compensation; and that
                            it could not be believed that such claim would not have been made if Her
                            Majesty’s government had considered such a claim valid. The counsel for
                            the United States cited, in the connection, the letter of Mr. Stuart,
                            Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, to Mr. Seward, of 1st August,
                            1862, (U. S. Dip. Cor., 1862, 1863, part 1, p. 273,) upon a somewhat
                            analogous question, in which Mr. Stuart says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have been instructed to state to you that Her Majesty’s
                                    government, after considering these dispatches, in connection
                                    with the law-officers of the Crown, are of opinion that it is
                                    competent for the United States, as a belligerent power, to
                                    protect itself within its own ports and territory by refusing
                                    clearances to vessels laden with contraband of war or other
                                    specified articles, as well as to vessels which are believed to
                                    be bound to confederate ports. And that so long as such
                                    precautions are adopted, equally and indifferently in all cases,
                                    without reference to the nationality or origin of any particular
                                    vessel or goods, they do not afford any just ground of
                                    complaint.</p>

                        <p>The case of the detention of the Labuan, it was contended on the part of
                            the United States, was governed by the same principles and justified by
                            the same rules as the cases referred to by Mr. Stuart. The counsel
                            referred to the decision of the commission upon the American claims
                            against Great Britain, growing out of the prohibition of the exportation
                            of saltpetre at Calcutta, (American claims, Nos. 11, 12, 16, 18,)
                            hereinbefore reported, and in which such prohibition was held by the
                            commission not to involve a violation either of international law or of
                            treaty stipulation; and urged that the principles which would sustain
                            the validity of such prohibition must also include such a case as the
                            detention of the Labuan.</p>
                        <p>The counsel for the claimant maintained that the detention of the Labuan
                            was in effect a deprivation of the owners of the use of their property
                            for the time of the detention for the public benefit; that it was in
                            effect a taking of private property for public use, always justified by
                            the necessity of the State, but likewise always involving the obligation
                            of compensation. He cited 3d Phillimore, 42, and Dana’s Wheaton, 152,
                                <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p>
                        <p>The commission unanimously made an award in favor of the claimant for
                            $37,392.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Catharine J. Johnson, executrix, No. 449, the memorial
                            alleged that the claimant’s testator was the sole registered owner of
                            the British schooner James Douglas, which-vessel, while on a voyage from
                            Cuba to New York, met with disaster which led to her being abandoned by
                            the master and crew; that she was subsequently fallen in with by a
                            United States vessel of war, which took her into the port of Beaufort,
                            North Carolina, where she was appropriated to the use of the United
                            States Government; that on application to that Government for her
                            restoration, the Secretary of the Navy gave directions that <pb n="173"
                                xml:id="pg_173" facs="0229"/>the vessel be surrendered to her owner
                            on his renouncing all claims for the use of the vessel by the United
                            States; that, notwithstanding these orders, the vessel had never been
                            restored to her owner, but was still in the port of Beaufort under the
                            control of the officials of the United States. The claimant claimed
                            damages $7,000, besides interest.</p>
                        <p>The proofs showed that, after the vessel was brought into port, and
                            before any claim was interposed on behalf of her owner, some use had
                            been made of the vessel by the Navy Department; that the claim of the
                            owner was interposed through the British legation, and that the United
                            States Government at once offered to surrender her on payment of a
                            reasonable salvage to the officers and crew of the vessel which brought
                            her in. Some objection being made to the payment of the salvage asked,
                            the United States Government directed her surrender without salvage, on
                            the claimant’s waiving claim for compensation for the use that had been
                            made of her while in port. No objection was made to this condition, and
                            no further claim was ever advanced by any person for the vessel. She
                            remained lying at Beaufort waiting requisition of her owner, and nothing
                            further was ever heard of the matter until the filing of the memorial
                            before the commission.</p>
                        <p>The commission (Mr. Commissioner Gurney dissenting) made an award in the
                            following words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>We think it does not appear that the United States appropriated
                                    the vessel, and we regard it as yet being the claimant’s
                                    property. The claim is, therefore, disallowed.</p>

                        <p>The high contracting parties agree that all claims on the part of
                            corporations, companies, or private individuals (citizens of the United

                            appointed in the following manner, that is to say: One commissioner
                            shall be named by the President of the United States, one by Her
                            Britannic Majesty, and a third by the President of the United States and
                            Her Britannic Majesty conjointly; and in case the third commissioner
                            shall not have been so named within a period of three months from the
                            date of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, then the third
                                <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0232"/>commissioner shall be named
                            by the representative at Washington of His Majesty the King of Spain. In
                            case of the death, absence, or incapacity of any commissioner, or in the
                            event of any commissioner omitting or ceasing to act, the vacancy shall
                            be filled in the manner hereinbefore provided for making the original

                            such claims as shall be laid before them on the part of the governments
                            of the United States and of Her Britannic Majesty, respectively; and
                            such declaration shall be entered on the record of their

                            proper, but upon such evidence or information only as shall be furnished
                            by or on behalf of the respective governments. They shall be bound to
                            receive and consider all written documents or statements which may be

                            shall be given upon each claim in writing, and shall be signed by the
                            commissioners assenting to it. It shall be competent for each government

                        <p>1. In addition to the representation of his claim, and the proofs in
                            support thereof which shall have been presented to his government, the
                            claimant shall file in the office of the commission a statement of his

                        <p>4. The memorial must state the particulars of the claim, the general
                            grounds on which it is founded, and the amount claimed. It shall be
                            verified by the oath or affirmation of the claimant, or, in the case
                            hereinafter provided, of his agent or attorney; or if the claim be by a
                            firm or an incorporate association of persons, then by the oath or
                            affirmation of one of them; or in the case of a corporation or

                            diplomatic agent of either government. The verification may be by the
                            agent or attorney only when verification by the claimant is
                            substantially impracticable, or can only be given at great
                            inconvenience. And in case of verification by agent or attorney, the
                            cause of the failure of the claimant to verify it shall be stated.</p>

                            objection. Any new matter, constituting a special ground of defense, may
                            be stated in a plea, which may be the subject of demurrer, and all
                            demurrers may be set for hearing on a ten days’ notice.</p>
                        <p>5. Every claimant shall be allowed two months, after the filing of his

                            proofs, and notice thereof given, two months shall be allowed for taking
                            proofs for the defense, with such further extension of time, in each
                            case, as the commission, on application, may grant, for cause shown.</p>
                        <p>After the proofs on the part of the defense shall have been closed, the
                            commission will, when the claimant shall desire to take rebutting proof,
                            accord a reasonable time for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>6. All depositions after the filing of the memorial shall be taken on

                            sufficient precision to be accepted by the counsel of the government
                            against whom such witness is to be produced, to be signified by his
                            indorsement thereon. Such interrogatories or statement to be filed in
                            the office of the commission at least fifteen days before the day named
                            for the examination, with one additional day for every five hundred
                            miles of distance from Washington to the place where the deposition is
                            to be taken. When depositions are to be taken elsewhere than in North
                            America thirty days will be allowed.</p>
                        <p>7. Every deposition taken in the United States shall be taken before some
                            officer authorized to take depositions in causes pending in courts of
                            the United States. Depositions in Great Britain and her possessions may
                            be taken before any person authorized to take depositions to be used in
                            courts of record, or any justice of the peace. Depositions in those
                            countries or elsewhere may be taken before any consul or diplomatic
                            agent of either government.</p>
                        <p>In all cases the cross-examination of the witness may be by written
                            interrogatories, or orally, in the election of the party
                            cross-examining.</p>
                        <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0235"/>
                        <p>8. The commissioners may at any time issue a special commission for the
                            taking of testimony on the application of either party; such testimony
                            to be taken either in written interrogatories or orally, as the
                            commissioners may order.</p>
                        <p>The commissioners may also, on motion of either party, order any claimant
                            or witness to appear personally before them for examination or
                            cross-examination.</p>
                        <p>9. When any original papers filed in the State Department of the United
                            States or in the archives of the British legation in Washington cannot
                            be conveniently withdrawn from the files, copies thereof will be
                            received in evidence, when certified by the State Department or by the
                            British legation, as the case may be.</p>
                        <p>10. When the time has expired for taking proofs, or the case has been
                            closed on both sides, the proofs will be printed under the direction of
                            the secretary, and at the expense of the commission. The argument for
                            the claimant shall be filed within fifteen days after the paper shall
                            have been printed, and the case shall stand for hearing ten days
                            thereafter.</p>
                        <p>11. The secretary will prepare, from time to time, lists of cases ready
                            for hearing, either upon demurrer or upon the merits, in the order in
                            which they are entitled to be heard, or in which the counsel for the two
                            governments shall agree that they shall be heard.</p>
                        <p>12. All cases will be submitted on printed arguments, which shall contain
                            a statement of the facts proven and reference to the evidence by which
                            they are proven, and, <hi rend="italic">in addition</hi>, the counsel
                            for the respective governments will be heard whenever they desire to
                            argue any cause orally. Arguments of counsel for individual claimants
                            will be received, in print, when submitted by the counsel of either
                            government, and not otherwise.</p>
                        <p>13. Claims against the United States and Great Britain, respectively,
                            will be entered in different dockets kept by the secretary. The dockets
                            shall contain an abstract of all proceedings, motions, and orders in
                            each case.</p>
                        <p>14. The secretary will keep a record of the proceedings of the commission
                            upon each day of its session, which shall be read at the next meeting,
                            and will then be signed by him and approved by the signature of the
                            presiding commissioner.</p>
                        <p>15. The secretary will keep a notice-book, in which entries may be made
                            by the counsel for either government, and all entries so made shall be
                            notice to the opposing counsel.</p>
                        <p>16. The secretary shall provide books of printed forms, in which will be
                            recorded the awards of the commission, signed by the commissioners
                            concurring therein. The awards against each government will be kept in a
                            separate book.</p>
                        <p>17. A copy of each award, certified by the secretary of the commission,
                            will be furnished, on request, to the party upon whose claim such award
                            shall have been made.</p>
                        <p>18. The dockets, minutes of proceedings, and records of awards will be
                            kept in duplicate, one of which will be delivered to each government at
                            the close of the duties of the commission.</p>
                        <p>19. The secretary will have charge of all the books and papers of the
                            commission, and no papers shall be withdrawn from the files or taken
                            from the office without an order of the commission.</p>

                        <p>We award that the Government of the United States of America shall pay to
                            the government of Her Britannic Majesty, within twelve months from the

                            assented to said separate awards.</p>
                        <p>And all other such claims on the part of subjects of Her Britannic

                            of Her Britaunic Majesty, arising out of acts committed against the
                            persons or property of citizens of the United States, between the
                            thirteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and
                            the ninth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five,

                            to in the first article of said treaty, have been and are hereby
                            disallowed; separate awards upon each of said claims having been made in

                        <p>These cases arise out of certain legislative ordinances of the
                            governor-general of India, dated respectively December 21, 1861, and
                            January 3, <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0287"/>1862. By the first
                            of these ordinances the exportation of saltpetre from India was
                            prohibited after that date, except to London and Liverpool, in British
                            vessels, under penalty of confiscation: <hi rend="italic">provided</hi>,
                            that the prohibition should not extend to cases where permits to export
                                <hi rend="italic">had previously</hi> been granted.</p>
                        <p>By the second ordinance the provi<gap quantity="1" unit="characters"/>o
                            of the first, excepting cases where permits to export had been granted
                            prior to December 21, 1861, was rescinded; and the article was required
                            to be relanded from vessels in port. The first ordinance was also so
                            modified as to permit the article to be exported in British vessels to
                                <hi rend="italic">any</hi> port in the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Bush <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, the vessel had a
                            permit to export the saltpeter on board before the date of the first
                            ordinance. She continued to load other goods, placing them upon the
                            saltpetre; and being in the port of Calcutta when the second ordinance
                            was proclaimed, she was not permitted to sail as laden.</p>
                        <p>In the other cases the saltpetre was laden when the first ordinance took
                            effect, but custom-house permits to export it had <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> been obtained. In each case the vessels were American and
                            bound for the United States. They were, by the ordinances, required to
                            unlade the saltpetre; but by special arrangement with authorities it was
                            allowed to remain on board, and the vessels waited until the ordinances
                            were rescinded, a period of nearly two months. By this arrangement, it
                            seems that less injury resulted than would have occurred if the
                            saltpetre had been unladen. Damage from Great Britain is claimed for
                            this detention.</p>
                        <p>The statute of 24 and 25 Vict., chap. 67, seems to have authorized the
                            ordinances in question, not specifically, but by reason of the general
                            power of legislation which it conferred on the authorities in India.</p>
                        <p>Though Her Majesty was at that time at peace with all the world, yet
                            there existed a reasonable apprehension of speedy war with the United
                            States on account of the recent arrest of Messrs. Mason and Slidell on
                            board the royal mail-steamer Trent, on the high seas. This is an element
                            of importance, establishing that the ordinances of the governor-general
                            of India were proclaimed, not wantonly, bnt as an exercise of authority
                            with a view, <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, to protection and
                            self-defense, when the danger of war seemed probable.</p>
                        <p>A diplomatic correspondence concerning these claims ensued between the
                            two governments. The facts were not controverted; but conceding them,
                            the British government, advised by the law-officers of the Crown, denied
                            all liability, while the American Government very positively asserted
                            it. This alone imparts importance to the question, and suggests that it
                            should receive the most careful consideration.</p>

                        <p>If the case is within the treaty of 1815 it is, of course, immaterial to
                            determine what should be our award in the absence of treaty
                            stipulations. By the convention of August 6, 1827, that of 1815 was
                            continued indefinitely, terminable on one year’s notice, which was never
                            given. This was before the statute 24 and 25 Vict., though I do not deem
                            the fact important.</p>
                        <p>If by treaty the British government contracted <hi rend="italic">not to
                                do</hi> that which before it might lawfully and without liability
                            have done, it cannot afterward break its contract without a just
                            liability to answer for the consequences.</p>
                        <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>Was there, then, a contract by treaty, by the terms of which Great
                            Britain engaged not to do the things complained of?</p>
                        <p>By the third article of the treaty of 1815, His Britannic Majesty agreed
                            that citizens of the United States might “freely carry on trade between
                            Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and Prince of Wales Island, and the United
                            States, in all articles of which the importation and exportation to and
                            from <hi rend="italic">the said territories</hi> shall not be entirely
                            prohibited." The “said territories" can only mean Calcutta, Madras,
                            Bombay, and Prince of Wales Island; for those only were the territories
                            previously mentioned. To carry goods from Liverpool, or elsewhere in the
                            United Kingdom, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Calcutta for sale, would, it
                            can hardly be questioned, be an <hi rend="italic">importation</hi> to
                                “<hi rend="italic">said territories</hi>" in the sense of the treaty
                            so, then, as long as the importation of a given article from Liverpool
                            to Calcutta was not prohibited, it might also be imported from New York
                            by citizens of the United States. In short, American merchants, by that
                            article of the treaty, acquired the liberty to compete with British
                            merchants in supplying the markets of “<hi rend="italic">said
                                territories</hi>.” This is the natural import of the language; and
                            if these claims arose out of similar interference with American <hi
                                rend="italic">importations to</hi> Calcutta, say the prohibition to
                            unlade an American cargo under a like ordinance, proclaimed after the
                            arrival of the vessel at Calcutta, I can scarcely conceive that a demand
                            for redress would be denied by Her Majesty’s government. I think that in
                            such a case the language of the treaty would be deemed too plain to
                            admit of construction. And I cannot but think that as to <hi
                                rend="italic">importations</hi> to “said territories,” that language
                            expresses the exact intention of the high contracting parties.</p>
                        <p>As to <hi rend="italic">exhortations</hi>, it is not, I think, fairly
                            susceptible of controversy that the literal import of the language used
                            concedes to American citizens rights exactly co-extensive with those
                            which relate to importations. If not to prohibit the carrying of an
                            article from Liverpool to the market of Calcutta is to allow that
                            article to be <hi rend="italic">imported to</hi> Calcutta, in the sense
                            of the treaty; though it seems to me plain that not to prohibit the
                            carrying of saltpetre <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Calcutta <hi
                                rend="italic">to</hi> Liverpool is to allow saltpetre ‘ to be
                            exported <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Calcutta. In other words, by the
                            plainest language that could possibly have been employed, the quoted
                            words of the treaty concede to the United States a right to export and
                            import from or to “those territories" alike, unless either as to
                            specified articles shall be prohibited entirely, which is not done if
                            exports be allowed <hi rend="italic">from</hi> “those territories," or
                            if imports be allowed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> “those territories."</p>
                        <p>The question remains, was the taking of saltpetre from Calcutta to
                            Liverpool an exportation of that article <hi rend="italic">from
                                Calcutta</hi> in the sense of the treaty?</p>
                        <p>It is admitted in the intelligent argument of Her Majesty’s counsel that
                            in some sense the carriage of an article from Calcutta, “whether to a
                            port in the United Kingdom or to a foreign port, is an <hi rend="italic"
                                >exportation</hi>," nor can this be questioned philologically. The
                            word itself includes the former as well as the latter, whether reference
                            be had to its strict sense or its popular use. For proof of this use,
                            indeed, it is only necessary to refer to the very ordinances complained
                            of in these cases, in both of which the word is several times used in
                            that very sense, and certainly without impropriety. It is also used by
                            Earl Russell in the same sense, in his correspondence with Mr. Adams
                            concerning these claims. It is also used in the statute laws of both
                            countries, as well to indicate the carrying of goods from distant
                            colonies or possessions as from countries wholly foreign.</p>
                        <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0289"/>
                        <p>So much for the mere words of the treaty. Looking only at the language
                            quoted, the conclusion would seem to be that Great Britain engaged by
                            the treaty to permit citizens of the United States to export from
                            Calcutta to the United States such articles as she should permit to be
                            exported to the United Kingdom or any other place; <hi rend="italic">i.
                                e.</hi>, the exportation of which should not be “<hi rend="italic"
                                >entirely</hi> prohibited.” But the words of a treaty must be
                            construed with reference to their subject-matter, so as to forward the
                            intent of the high contracting parties, and not defeat it, and so as to
                            avoid absurd results.</p>
                        <p>Now, the intent of the third article of the treaty of 1815 undoubtedly
                            was to give to the United States the liberty of direct trade with the
                            places mentioned in the East Indies; so that Americans might purchase
                            and sell <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, and with their own ships
                            transport goods to and from their own country, from and to those places.
                            The mischief sought to be remedied was that the United States Government
                            was previously obliged to supply herself with the products of those
                            places at second hand in the markets of Great Britain, and could only
                            exchange her products with them through the same indirect channel.</p>
                        <p>Now, it must be seen at once that if the British government reserved to
                            itself the right asserted, (continuing herself to trade there,) then the
                            concession which seemed to be made was a mere delusion and snare to
                            American merchants, giving no right which Great Britain might not
                            withdraw at any moment with advantage to her own merchants at home. In
                            short, she could at will resume the entire monopoly of the trade with
                            her East Indian posessions; for it must be borne in mind that the
                            language under consideration, by virtue of which it is contended that
                            the ordinances in question can be justified, applies quite as well to
                            all other commodities as to saltpetre, and to imports as well as to
                            exports. A treaty stipulation with such a meaning would be worse than an
                            utter nullity.</p>
                        <p>There are some other clauses found in this article of the treaty which
                            need to be considered. There is the clause usual in commercial treaties,
                            which makes citizens of the United States trading in those places
                            “subject in all respects to the laws and regulations of the Britsh
                            government from time to time established.” Of this it is, perhaps,
                            sufficient to say, that it cannot be supposed that such a clause is a
                            reservation of authority to prohibit the very trade which it was the
                            leading purpose of the article to allow. In the language of Earl Russell
                            concerning the same clause, in the first article of the treaty, (letter
                            to Lord Lyons of December 17, 1862,) "it does not mean that the
                            principal engagement itself may be nullified, or may be rendered
                            illusory either in whole or in part; * * * but merely that obedience is
                            to be rendered by foreign traders * * to all the laws and statutes
                            enacted * * for the ordinary and legitimate purposes of internal
                            government and administration. * * I have to observe (he adds) that it
                            is a well-known maxim that treaties are to be interpreted in good faith,
                            and in such a manner that they may have their effect and not be rendered
                            vague or illusory.” And Mr. Seward’s reply (letter to Lord Lyons of
                            January 9, 1863) contains a virtual admission of the correctness of the
                            principle so well stated by Earl Russell.</p>
                        <p>It may be added that it is impossible to perceive the force of the
                            argument that a year’s notice should be given to terminate the treaty,
                            if it was provided that it could be effectually nullified by one of the
                            parties, at will, by an act of legislation.</p>
                        <p>But there remains a consideration of much greater weight, as I think. <pb
                                n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0290"/>than those which have been
                            alluded to above. Self-preservation and self-defense are sacred rights
                            of nations as well as of individuals; and nothing in a treaty should be
                            taken to have impaired the right of a nation to make prudent
                            preparations for them by husbanding its means of war, when that event
                            seems probable, unless the terms of the stipulation will admit of no
                            other construction.</p>
                        <p>There is a provision in the article under consideration which shows
                            clearly that the exigency of possible war was distinctly in mind when
                            the treaty was concluded. Indeed, such were the events then existing in
                            the history of both counties that it would have been remarkable if it
                            had not been. The provision is in those words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Provided only that it shall not he lawful for them, (citizens of
                                    the United States,) in any time of war between the British
                                    government and any state or power whatever, to export from the
                                    said territories, without the special permission of the British
                                    government, any military stores or naval stores, or rice.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This exception to the general liberty to trade conceded before, is free
                            from ail ambiguity. That it covers only the case of actual war, shows
                            most clearly that it was not deemed important, and was not intended to
                            make any reservation for the case of war merely apprehended. The one
                            thing being expressed, all else is excluded. <hi rend="italic">Expressio
                                unius est exclusio alterius</hi>. This maxim of interpretation is
                            sensible and sound, and I think never was more applicable in any case
                            than here.</p>
                        <p>If I have correctly interpreted the treaty, then it is of no consequence
                            Whatever that the ordinances applied to all nations alike. A specific
                            engagement definite in its terms can be fulfilled only by the
                            performance of it in all its substantial parts. It is not to be
                            confounded with an engagement to extend only the privileges which shall
                            be allowed to other powers or to the most favored nation.</p>
                        <p>These considerations seem to me to establish very clearly the validity of
                            these claims, and I am of opinion that damages should be awarded
                            accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Henderson, in whose behalf Great Britain makes this claim, is a British
                            subject by birth, and has taken no steps toward becoming naturalized in
                            this or any other country. He became domiciled near Port Hudson, in the
                            parish of West Feliciana, in 1850, employed in cultivating and dealing
                            in cotton, and has ever since resided there. There is no room to doubt
                            that it was his voluntary and permanent domicile. It is not even alleged
                            that he maintained a personal neutrality during any period of the
                            rebellion, and there is no proof whatever of that fact. In June, 1863,
                            he owned in the neighborhood of 112 bales of cotton. After twenty-seven
                            days of effort by continuous fighting, General Banks, commanding the
                            United States forces investing the fortified town of Port Hudson, held
                            by the rebels, found himself unable to carry the works by assault, and
                            thereupon commenced a regular siege of the place. Cotton found in the
                            neighborhood, including Henderson’s, was, without discrimination, seized
                            by the United States forces, and used almost exclusively in the
                            construction of fortifications, a purpose to which cotton in bales <pb
                                n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0291"/>is known to be well adapted in
                            the emergencies of a siege. The officer who took Henderson’s cotton gave
                            papers as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>The fortifications and works of the besiegers were extensive, being equal
                            to a continous line of over seven miles. After the fall of Port Hudson,
                            the cotton was gathered up, cleaned, and sold, and the proceeds applied
                            to the use of the troops of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Under these facts the majority of the commission determine that Henderson
                            has a valid claim against the United States for the value of his cotton,
                            and an award is made in favor of Great Britain accordingly.</p>
                        <p>I cannot join in this award, and the principles of public law involved in
                            it and contravened by it, seem to me so very important and so well
                            settled, that I feel it my duty respectfully to state the reasons which
                            control my action now and may control it in other cases.</p>
                        <p>1. That a foreigner domiciled in the United States, voluntarily remaining
                            in a hostile part of it, in rebellion against it, that part recognized
                            by the country of his origin as a belligerent, thus choosing to trust
                            himself to its protection, thus being <hi rend="italic">in law</hi> an
                            enemy of the United States, without even pretending that he was <hi
                                rend="italic">in fact</hi> neutral, may be recognized as entitled to
                            maintain a claim against it for property appropriated by its invading
                            armies, when no citizen of the United States could under like
                            circumstances claim such consideration, is a proposition to which I must
                            enter an earnest and emphatic dissent. If it has any support in equity,
                            justice, or the public law, then I am greatly in error.</p>
                        <p>2. The cotton was the property of an enemy of the United States, so
                            recognized by every writer upon international law, and so held by all
                            tribunals, both American and British as well as continental, in every
                            reported case involving the question. The mixed commission, constituted
                            under the convention of 1858, between the two countries, so held in
                            Laurent’s case. Indeed, it went further, and held that an unnaturalized
                            Englishman voluntarily domiciled in a country at war with the United
                            States was not even to be regarded as a British subject; thus going a
                            little too far, as I think.</p>
                        <p>The property of Henderson was as liable to capture as the property of
                            Jeff. Davis himself, or any rebel in arms. I believe this is not
                            questioned. That the property itself was a proper subject of capture on
                            land under the modern rules by which civilized nations govern themselves
                            in war, seems to me to be quite as clear.</p>
                        <p>The legislation and the known practice of the rebel authorities made it
                            so. They made cotton the basis of their public credit by a policy which
                            aimed to deal largely in it on government account, to purchase it even
                            before it was grown, and hypothecate it as security for the payment of
                            loans, with the proceeds of which they did, to a large extent, supply
                            themselves with arms and munitions of war, and with a fleet of armed
                            vessels to infest the ocean and destroy American commerce. They
                            committed it to the flames, whether owned by friend or foe, rather than
                            permit it to reach the markets of the world otherwise than through their
                            own ports; thus endeavoring by warlike operations to secure to <pb
                                n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0292"/>themselves a monopoly in
                            supplying the foreign demand, that they might thereby constrain nations
                            abroad to aid them in their struggle. In short, cotton was a special and
                            formidable foundation of the rebel military power. It was more important
                            than arms or ships of war, for it supplied these and all else beside. It
                            was more potent than gold, for it not only commanded gold, but it
                            largely enlisted in behalf of the rebels the interests of foreigners
                            whose manufacturing industry was in a measure paralyzed because this
                            staple was needed to keep it in motion. The necessities and purposes of
                            war, therefore, required its capture at every opportunity more
                            imperatively than the capture of munitions and implements of war;
                            indeed, that necessity was quite as pressing and certainly as humane as
                            the killing of men in battle; for it was no less efficient as a means of
                            accomplishing the subjugation of the rebel armies, and re-establishing
                            the national authority. It is to me astonishing if there is a difference
                            of opinion upon this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Supreme Court of the United States, recognizing to the fullest extent
                            all the limitations which the practice of nations has lately engrafted
                            upon the right of capture upon land, so held in the case of a loyal
                            American widow. (See the case of Mrs. Alexander’s Cotton, 2 Black.) This
                            is high authority, especially when it is remembered that that august
                            tribunal has certainly exhibited no tendency whatever to give undue
                            license to military authority or warlike operations. Complaint, if any,
                            has been altogether in the other direction. But I would be quite
                            content, in the absence of any authority, to trust the question with the
                            common sense of all civilized nations so long as war in any form shall
                            be recognized as a lawful method of deciding differences. If the capture
                            was rightful by the laws of war, it would be a novelty in international
                            law that its exercise involves an obligation to make compensation.</p>
                        <p>3. But another point remains, which in my judgement is absolutely
                            conclusive agaisnt any award on account of this claim, if the rules of
                            international law should control the determination of the question.
                            Henderson was voluntarily and permanently domiciled in one of the
                            rebellious States, the territory held by the so-called Confederate
                            States recognized by Great Britain as a belligerent. By that act of
                            recognition all British subjects were bound. If they chose to remain in
                            that part of the world, they voluntarily took the chances of war and
                            intrusted their interests to the protection of that organization. They
                            must look to it for protection from the results of war; and now that it
                            has, by the fortunes of war, been exterminated, the country of their
                            origin has no right (save possibly in exceptionally flagrant cases) to
                            intervene in their behalf as against the United States for
                            indemnification. This I think is as clearly established as a rule of
                            international law as anything can be. It was so held in Laurent’s case,
                                <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>. It was so declared by the American
                            Secretary of State in reference to the bombardment of Grey town, and was
                            then assented to by the English government under the advice of the
                            law-officers of the Crown. The Attorney-General on that occasion
                            declared in Parliament that <hi rend="italic">every jurist admitted
                                it</hi>. He said “the principle which governed such cases was that
                            the citizens of foreign states who resided within the arena of war had
                            no right to demand compensation from either of the belligerents,” (See
                            Wheat. Int. Law, 173—note by Lawrence.) This rule is so much in the
                            interest of the peace of nations that it should be steadfastly
                            maintained. A right to interfere is so intimately associated with the
                            duty of doing so, that any relaxation of this principle would but
                            multiply occasions of war and afford too many opportunities for that
                            armed intervention in the quarrels of others which is sometimes sought,
                            in vain, by ambitious rulers.</p>

                        <p>The capture or destruction of property on land belonging to individual
                            enemies is justified by the modern law of nations, if there be military
                            reasons for it; in the absence of good military reasons such captures
                            are generally without the support of the public law. When such reasons
                            do exist, such capture or destruction is, in the nature of things, quite
                            as proper as the capture or destruction of such property on the high
                            seas.</p>
                        <p>The latter is maintained because an enemy’s commerce and navigation are
                            “the sinews of his naval power,” to take or destroy which is, therefore,
                            a legitimate act of war. (Wheat. Int. Law; Lawrence, 626.)</p>
                        <p>“The sinews" of his <hi rend="italic">military</hi> power on land must,
                            in view of the natural law, be equally the subject of capture or
                            destruction by an invading army. Cotton was held to be such by the
                            Supreme Court, in the case of Mrs. Alexander’s cotton, (2 Wall., 404.)
                            The reasoning of the opinion of the Chief Justice in that case is, I
                            think, unanswerable.</p>
                        <p>The war of the American rebellion was a civil war—an immense one, too,
                            and the Government had all the rights of war which it would have had if
                            its enemy had been an independent nation. Even the rebel organization
                            was recognized by Her Majesty’s government as a belligerent, <hi
                                rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, having the rights of war 5 and certainly
                            that government is thereby estopped from denying, and, indeed, never has
                            denied, that belligerent rights also belonged to the Government of the
                            United States. Every act of war recognized as lawful by the public law
                            between independent states at war was, therefore, lawful on the part of
                            the United States, and involved no cause for reclamation on the part of
                            neutrals. On this ground only, as a lawful belligerent act, could a
                            blockade be maintained. The subject is discussed very fully by the
                            Supreme Court in the Prize Cases, 2 Black; and I think the reasoning of
                            that court is conclusive.</p>
                        <p>Neutral’s property in the enemy’s territory stands exactly on the same
                            footing as any other property found there. Indeed, a neutral domiciled
                            there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an enemy in view of the public law. He
                            may be compelled to serve the enemy as a soldier even, and his property
                            must contribute to the support of the enemy’s hostile operations without
                            reference to his national character. I think that all authorities,
                            British, continental, and American, are in accord upon the proposition
                            that the belligerent right of capture of movable property on land is in
                            no respect affected by the nationality of its owner.</p>
                        <p>Whatever is lawfully done in the exercise of belligerent rights cannot
                            involve any liability contemplated by the treaty 5 it cannot possibly be
                            a tort.</p>
                        <p>The belligerent right of capture must not be confounded with the right of
                            eminent domain, which is a civil right exercised in virtue of
                            sovereignty. The two are wholly distinct and rest upon different
                            grounds.</p>
                        <p>Grant’s case, (C. Cls., 1863,) cited by Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel,
                            was not a destruction of enemy’s property; it was not in the enemy’s
                            lines, nor in a seceding State. It was a destruction of property in
                            Arizo, within actual possession of the United States, to prevent its
                            falling into the enemy’s hands, and by the Constitution of the United
                            States compensation for it was secured, and this only did the court
                            decide.</p>
                        <p>But are we to be told that the Government of the United States is
                            compelled by its Constitution to pay its rebellious citizens for their
                                <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0294"/>property destroyed as a
                            lawful, <hi rend="italic">belligerent</hi> act? Has its Constitution
                            thus tied its hands as against a rebellion? Might the rebels, without
                            liability, exercise all recognized belligerent rights against it,
                            including the capture of the property of British subjects found in the
                            loyal States, and yet it do the like only subject to the duty of making
                            compensation?</p>
                        <p>From all this absurdity there is no escape if the belligerent right of
                            capture and destruction shall be confounded with the sovereign right of
                            eminent domain. And indeed captures on the high seas must then go into
                            the same general category.</p>
                        <p>In fine, a constitutional provision—the condition of compensation for
                            property taken for public use—intended only to restrain civil
                            administration, would be held to so trammel belligerent rights in time
                            of civil war that effective hostilities against rebels might sometimes
                            be practically impossible.</p>
                        <p>Now, Congress saw that the full exercise of the belligerent right of
                            capture on land was, as to cotton especially, of the greatest military
                            importance, and that such capture would, therefore, be extensive, and
                            that it would fall alike on the loyal and the disloyal citizen, and also
                            upon foreign residents in the South who had not actually violated any
                            duty. It was a generous policy to mitigate calamities which a war thus
                            lawfully conducted would nevertheless impose upon persons guilty of no
                            actual wrong. If the capture was a lawful act of war, to restore a
                            portion of the proceeds would been act of grace and generosity
                            constituting no foundation for a claim for more; and if a particular
                            mode was at the same time provided, whereby this partial restitution
                            might be sought, that mode only could be resorted to. The right
                            generously given and the mode of seeking it must go together.</p>
                        <p>The act concerning captured and abandoned property, allowing loyal
                            persons to recover in the Court of Claims, was just this act of grace.
                            (Anderson’s case, 9 Wall., 56.)</p>
                        <p>My conclusions are: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Again, it is a principle of international law established by the practice
                            of all civilized states, and sanctioned by every consideration of
                            expediency and justice, that where a nation has provided an adequate
                            municipal remedy by judicial proceedings for wrongs done by it to
                            foreigners domiciled within its jurisdiction, as well as to its own
                            subjects, no international reclamation can be made, at least until this
                            municipal remedy has been exhausted.</p>
                        <p>Upon this principle, also, this commission should make no award in this
                            class of cases. The Court of Claims was open to these claimants, with
                            jurisdiction to give them reasonable compensation for captures of
                            cotton. There citizens of the United States must go for relief within
                            the time limited by act of Congress; and I cannot assent to the
                            proposition that domiciled aliens have a better claim than citizens.</p>
                        <p>I would not be understood to hold that the right of capture of enemy’s
                            property on land, as recognized in recent times, is as broad as it is at
                            sea. The military reason for it must be more palpable and immediate.
                            There is a remote possibility that to take the lives of
                                non-combatants—<pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0295"/>enemies—may
                            weaken the enemy, for these might be forced into the armies of the
                            enemy; so, too, as to an <hi rend="italic">indiscriminate</hi> capture
                            or destruction of private property. But all this is condemned by the
                            modern law, and I would shudder to countenance a revival of practices so
                            horrible.</p>
                        <p>I admit, too, that there may be difficulty in defining the precise limits
                            of the right of capture on land. It cannot be doubted that it may be as
                            broad and general as the practice of the enemy in that regard: for
                            retaliation is fully justified by institutional writers, and by the
                            practice of all nations.</p>
                        <p>So I suppose it would not be questioned that arms, munitions of
                            war-commissary and quartermaster’s supplies, intended for sale to the
                            enemy, might be captured or destroyed. So, too, private manufactories
                            intended to furnish arms to be sold to the enemy, &amp;c., &amp;c. This
                            enumeration might be extended.</p>
                        <p>I feel safe in asserting that no nation in Christendom has practically
                            abandoned the right to capture and destroy in all such cases. It is a
                            direct blow at the military power of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>So if an enemy banker has engaged to supply the enemy government with
                            money, may not the cash in his vaults for that purpose be captured?</p>
                        <p>This, too, would be a <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> blow at the sinews of
                            his military power, quite as effective and not less humane than taking
                            of life in battle.</p>

                        <p>This is a claim for the destruction of 819 bales of cotton belonging to
                            the claimant by rebels in arms against the United States. The property
                            was destroyed in Louisiana and Mississippi in 1862 by the confederate
                            forces with the concurrence of the rebel authorities of Louisiana, one
                            of the Confederate States so called. Her Britannic Majesty had
                            recognized the so-called Confederate States as a belligerent and the
                            contest of arms then prevailing as a public war. After such recognition
                            by the sovereign, the subject of such sovereign cannot, in his character
                            as such subject, aver that the fact was not so. The act of his
                            government in that regard is conclusive upon him.</p>
                        <p>Aside from this recognition by Her Majesty, it is public history of which
                            this commission will take notice without averment or proof, that the
                            confederate forces were engaged at the time in a formidable rebellion
                            against the government of the United States. It may not be important to
                            the question in hand, therefore, that Her Majesty had taken the action
                            already stated.</p>
                        <p>It should be further observed that the particular “State of Louisiana”
                            which concurred and participated in the destruction of the claimant’s
                            property was a rebel organization, existing and acting as much in
                            hostility to the Government of the United States as was the Confederate
                            States, so-called. It was inform and fact a creature unknown to the
                            Constitution of the United States, and acting in hostility to it. It was
                            an instrumentality of the rebellion. Its agency, therefore, in the
                            spoliation of this cotton cannot be likened to the act of a State of the
                            American <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0296"/>Union claiming to
                            exist under the Constitution; and any argument tending to show that
                            under international law the national government is liable to answer for
                            wrongs committed by such a state upon the subjects of a foreign power,
                            can have no application to the matter now under consideration. The
                            question presented is simply whether the Government of the United States
                            is liable to answer to a neutral for the acts of those in rebellion
                            against it under the circumstances stated, who never succeeded in
                            establishing a government. It is not deemed necessary in this case to
                            inquire whether the claimant, having a commercial domicile in Louisiana
                            at the time, is to be deemed a British “subject of Her Britannic
                            Majesty” in the sense of Article XII of the treaty which creates this
                            commission. That question is argued by counsel, but it is thought better
                            to meet the question above stated for the reason that the case will
                            thereby be determined more distinctly upon its merits.</p>
                        <p>The statement of the question would seem to render it unnecesary to
                            discuss it. It is not the case of a government established <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi>, displacing the government <hi
                                rend="italic">de jure</hi>. But it is the case merely of an
                            unsuccessful effort in that direction, which, for the time being,
                            interrupted the course of lawful government without the fault of the
                            latter.</p>
                        <p>Its acts were lawless and criminal, and could result in no liabilty on
                            the part of the Government of the United States.</p>

                            subjects, against the other government. The correspondence which led to
                            the treaty clearly shows that this means “<hi rend="italic">claims
                                of</hi>” the citizens or subjects of either government, against the
                            other government. (Sir Edward Thornton to Secretary Fish, February 1,
                            1871, and Mr. Fish’s reply of February 3, 1871. See Protocol I.)</p>

                            are we to ascertain who <hi rend="italic">then</hi> has such claim? The
                            international law is silent, giving no answer to this question. It is a
                            matter regulated by municipal law, and the law of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >domicile</hi> of the deceased must be referred to to ascertain who
                            takes the rights which he had while in life; that is to say, to
                            ascertain who is the individual “citizen or subject” in whose behalf a
                            claim exists after the death of the original claimant. If by the
                            municipal law of the <hi rend="italic">domicile</hi> of the deceased <hi
                                rend="italic">nobody</hi> is entitled, then by this treaty we cannot
                            make an allowance; for we can only do that where there is an <hi
                                rend="italic">individual</hi>, British or American, who has a claim.
                            We have no authority to create a claimant. The treaty <hi rend="italic"
                                >might</hi> have provided for such cases, but it did not. It might
                            have provided that proper damages should be awarded against our
                            government in favor of the other, for the wrong to the nation, without
                            reference to any question of the right of an individual to such damages,
                            leaving the government in <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0297"/>whose
                            favor the award should be made to determine, as it might see fit, what

                        <p>The treaty of the United States with New Granada, and that with Mexico,

                        <p>Where the personal injury was to one domiciled either in the United

                            entitled to make claim; because, by the laws of both countries, the
                            right to damages is extinguished by the death of the person injured.</p>

                            not agree that it should be large.</p>
                        <p>When the American rebellion began he was domiciled at Nassau, and so
                            continued until June 13, 1861, when he removed to New York, having made
                            his arrangements for that purpose the previous year, (his deposition, p.
                            37.)</p>
                        <p>The rebellion was not hatched in a corner. The firing upon Fort Sumter
                            was not a surprise. For many weeks prior thereto, it was known all over
                            America and Europe that elaborate preparations were being made for the
                            attack. It was virtually under siege for weeks before a gun was fired,
                            its supplies cut off, and fortifications for attack being built. This is
                            public history. It is not pretended that this was not known in Nassau.
                            Arms of all kinds were sought and in demand in the South. This claimant
                            was at that time willing to supply that demand, and for the sake of
                            profit to put in Wilmington two cannon which he owned, to be used to
                            destroy the Government whose hospitality he intended in a few weeks to
                            accept. One of his explanations of this is that, when so intending in
                            April, 1861, he did not know that firing upon Sumter had really yet
                            begun! This was his statement to Consul Archibald, (memorial, p. 17,) in
                            September, 1861. It is possible that the consul did not give his
                            statement correctly. But in December, 1872, he plainly means to be
                            understood that at that time (April, 1861) he “got news” for the first
                            time that there was “<hi rend="italic">likely to be war</hi>," and
                            therefore he did not send the guns to Wilmington! (his deposition, p.
                            48.) It overtaxes credulity to be expected to believe that an
                            intelligent merchant at Nassau did not learn, long before April, that
                            there was “likely to be a war.”</p>
                        <p>On September 2, 1861, the Government, being informed merely that he had
                            attempted to have the guns shipped from Nassau to Wilmington, and, so
                            far as we know, not learning that he was at the time a resident of
                            Nassau, and that it was probably before there was actual war, had him
                            arrested. Learning the facts as stated by the consul, he was promptly
                            released after sixteen days’ detention.</p>
                        <p>The Government had learned enough to have made it almost criminal not to
                            be afterwards suspicious of Rahming. He had been willing to supply the
                            rebels with arms. He was trading ostensibly with Nassau, notoriously a
                            mere way-station for goods intended for the rebels. He had a
                            trading-house there. He was in business correspondence with, and sending
                            goods to persons there known to be in the confederate <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0298"/>trade. He was suspected and watched. It
                            would have been wicked negligence not to have watched him. Packages
                            shipped by him were found on board a confederate vessel captured in
                            attempting to violate the blockade—the “Margaret and Jessie.”</p>
                        <p>Domiciled now in New York, he could not lawfully aid the insurgents by
                            trading with them either directly or indirectly, even in the absence of
                            a blockade and an act of Congress prohibiting it. He was now in that
                            respect bound by all the duties incumbent on American citizens. He must
                            restrain his avarice—forego profit for the sake of the country in which
                            he resided.</p>
                        <p>Non-intercourse between belligerents rests upon a principle of public
                            law, and needed no act of Congress or public proclamation to establish
                            it. Trade with the enemy indirectly, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Nassau,
                            was notless a violation of this principle than <hi rend="italic"
                                >direct</hi> trade. If there was probable cause to believe him
                            guilty of this, his arrest was fully warranted. If he so conducted his
                            business as to create this belief, tempted thereto by the hope of gain,
                            he must submit to the consequences naturally resulting from it. He had
                            abundant notice that he was suspected, and this should have put him on
                            his guard.</p>
                        <p>December 31, 1863, he was again arrested, and was held six months and two
                            days. Was there probable cause for this arrest? It must not be forgotten
                            that it occurred immediately after the hearing and decree in the case of

                        <p>One might well inquire what more was needed to constitute probable cause
                            for his arrest.</p>
                        <p>Nor am I yet satisfied of his innocence. His own deposition, if fully
                            credited, ought perhaps to be deemed a sufficient explanation of nearly
                            everything. But I cannot accord full credit to his statements. He
                            furnished abundant reasons for (at least) caution in this respect. He
                            made his memorial under oath, stating when certain vessels were
                            detained, to his injury, viz, the Prince Alfred, in May, 1863, and the
                            Star of the West, in June. In his deposition he places the first event
                            sixteen months earlier, and the last eleven months earlier. The
                            explanation is that these errors must have been either <hi rend="italic"
                                >clerical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">typographical</hi>. That they
                            are not typographical appears by our files. Then we have his positive
                            and unnecessary affidavit in bankruptcy that he is an American citizen,
                            and his explanation that he did not read the affidavit! The least that
                            can reasonably be said of these explanations of his is that he is not
                                <hi rend="italic">careful</hi> as to <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he
                            shall swear to| an oath being by him regarded as imposing upon the
                            conscience no obligation to know what it is that is affirmed. What would
                            become of the administration of justice if all men were thus
                            careless?</p>

                        <p>His explanation of the marks on cases found on board the Margaret and
                            Jessie leaves something more to be desired. It is not very probable that
                            a steamship running the blockade would be laden, to any extent, with <hi
                                rend="italic">empty</hi> barrels and boxes; and where merchants use
                            old cases in which to pack goods, they mark them <hi rend="italic"
                                >anew</hi>. The old marks, it is true, sometimes remain legible, but
                            the Margaret and Jessie had on board several cases with only the marks
                            of Rahming’s consignees. It hardly explains this to say that his Nassau
                            house was in the habit of selling their <hi rend="italic">empty boxes
                                for what they would bring</hi>, unless we are also to suppose that
                            when the same cases were afterwards found in the confederate steamship
                            they were empty!</p>
                        <p>In short, I am not sure that it was not to him a great favor that he was
                            discharged without a trial.</p>
                        <p>His complaints of harsh and inhuman treatment in prison, other than would
                            ordinarily attend secure imprisonment, are, I think, sufficiently met by
                            the evidence for the defense.</p>
                        <p>But I think that he was detained too long; that he was reasonably
                            entitled to either trial or discharge earlier.</p>

                        <p>Upon the question whether a claim can now be maintained before this

                            prosecuted from the judgment of such courts, there being nothing in the

                            appeal, I have reached a conclusion in the negative. The reasons which
                            have led me to this opinion I put in writing for the consideration of my
                            learned colleagues, with the remark that, if I am wrong, I shall gladly
                            yield whenever it is shown.</p>
                        <p>“Justice and equity" constitute the rule of our decision by the terms of
                            the treaty. This is the foundation of international law, and when that
                            law speaks upon a question, we must be guided by it; for both countries,
                            as well as the nations of Christendomr, ecognize its principles as
                            equitable and just; and we shall be wholly at sea with no guide, and
                            disappoint both governments, if we disregard it. If by the international
                            law there is no valid claim in such a case, then I know not how its
                            validity can be maintained. True, the treaty confers upon us <hi
                                rend="italic">jurisdiction</hi> of such claims, because it refers
                            them to this commission. The question in hand is not of <hi
                                rend="italic">jurisdiction</hi>, but it is whether the cases as
                            stated in the several memorials constitute claims which ought to be
                            allowed. I do not doubt the jurisdiction, but that does not determine
                            their <hi rend="italic">validity</hi>. It only makes it our duty to
                            decide whether they are valid or not; and that decision should be
                            according to the principles of international law.</p>

                            American, Her Britannic Majesty’s counsel cites only a single case,
                            which it is urged should outweigh all the text-writers. The case cited
                            (bark Jones—American and British commission under treaty of 1853, p.
                            83,) was not a prize of war. It was a capture of a supposed slave-trader
                            made under British statutes. The capture was made at St. Helena, where
                            there was a court of record having jurisdiction, but the vessel was
                            taken to Sierra Leon, a distance of one thousand miles, for
                            adjudication. She was acquitted of the charge, and it was adjudged that
                            there was <hi rend="italic">no probable cause for seizure</hi>. But the
                            court assessed her with costs for “resistance of the master to fair
                            inquiry"—a personal matter of which the court had no cognizance under
                            the statute. There was no appeal. These are the circumstances under
                            which Judge Upham was of opinion that the owner was not bound to take an
                            appeal. He seems to have deemed the judgment for costs <hi rend="italic"
                                >coram non judice</hi> and utterly void. It further appears that the
                            master did not know where to follow his vessel, and was deprived of all
                            means of following it, (p. 101.) He did not appear in court. How could
                            he if such were the facts? Judge Upham, the American commissioner, might
                            well hold that under <hi rend="italic">such circumstances</hi> an appeal
                                <hi rend="italic">was not</hi> necessary to perfect the right of the

                            unless it was that claimed by Judge Upham—that the court had no
                            jurisdiction under the statute to adjudge costs against the vessel for
                            the alleged personal misconduct of the master. He was willing to allow

                            rest upon the precedents of exceptional or hard cases. That there should
                            be some exceptions to the general rule as I deem it to be, I have no
                            doubt. For instance, if, as in the case of the Jones, an appeal was
                            rendered very difficult or impossible, or was embarrassed, by the act of
                            the captors; or if previous appeals in similar cases had shown that the
                            appellate tribunal of last resort did not govern itself by international
                            law, thus indicating that an appeal would have been useless, or if it
                            had been waived by the government of the captor, I would hesitate long
                            before holding that appeal was necessary to lay the foundation for an
                            international claim.</p>
                        <p>But it is suggested that the text-writers cited are considering only the
                            grounds of war or reprisals, and not the causes adequate to justify a
                            claim for indemnity by one nation against another. I can only say that I
                            think this is a mistake. Besides, their reasoning, if correct, is
                            absolutely conclusive against both. If, as Rutherford asserts, “natural
                            equity will not allow that the state should be answerable," or “if the
                            subjects of the neutral state have no right to appeal to their own state
                            for a remedy against the erroneous sentence;” or if, according to
                            Wheaton, “the neutral has no ground of complaint,” and what he suffers
                            is only “the inevitable result of the belligerent right of capture;” or
                            if, according to Wildman, a failure to appeal is “an acknowledgment of
                            the justice of the sentence;" or if, according to Lawrence, “no claim
                            can be made on the government of the captor,” then I know not upon what
                            ground it can be held that these claims can be sustained upon the facts
                            as alleged.</p>
                        <p>But reprisals are justified by the public law for refusal to repair an
                            injury, and when it is admitted that reprisals cannot be made, it is
                            thereby confessed that there is no just international demand.</p>
                        <p>Granted a just claim or injury recognized by the public law, then by that
                            law the state aggrieved is the exclusive judge of the mode of
                            redress.</p>
                        <p>The note of Mr. Seward of December 22, 1862, concerning the case of the
                            Will-o’-the-Wisp, (No. 378, p. 30,) has been referred to.’ Was this
                            either a waiver of appeal in that case, or the expression of an opinion
                            that an appeal was not necessary? That note does not stand alone. The
                            reply of Lord Lyons (pp. 30, 31) seems to recognize that as a matter of
                            right the United States might stand on the absence of an appeal; but it
                            makes an appeal to the magnanimity of the American Government in the
                            particular case. Mr. Seward’s answer thereto of April 2, 1863, gives
                            distinct notice that the appeal is not waived, and that it is deemed
                            necessary before the executive government can be called upon to consider
                            the subject.</p>

                                put out of the case. No such thing was ever, for a moment, pretended
                                by the United States. If, however it is intended to suggest the
                                inference that damages must be awarded for these captures because it
                                was adjudged that these vessels were in fact engaged in that <hi

                                The reason is a good one for discharging the vessel, but it has
                                little to do with the question whether damages should be given. That

                                (satisfactory to Lord Russell,) of the contemporaneous disavowals of

                                courts, there is no warrant for the assumption (p. 21) that “these
                                captures were intended to affect the trade between Great Britain and
                                Mexico."</item>

                            <item>The doctrine that this commission may, by its decisions, disregard
                                the law of nations, in deference to whatever undefined notions of
                                “equity and justice” the several members of the commission may
                                happen to entertain from time to time, is to me a very great
                                surprise. It brings to mind the remark of an eminent English law
                                judge, resisting the establishment of the jurisdiction of the courts
                                of equity in that country, to the effect that decisions in equity
                                depended upon the individual conscience of whosoever happened to be
                                chancellor, and were therefore as uncertain as the length of the
                                chancellor's arm or foot! From such equity as that he might well
                                have wished the deliverance of his country. The injustice of his
                                reproach is, however, seen in the fact that “equity follows the
                                law"—abides by it—not only obeys but maintains it, and administers
                                justice according to a system of known and established principles
                                sanctioned by precedent; that it does not depend upon the individual
                                conscience of the judge.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>What is the law of nations which it is insisted this commission may
                            disregard? All definitions of it are in accord, substantially, and none
                            of them better than Blackstone’s, “that which regulates the conduct and
                            mutual intercourse of independent states with each other by <hi
                                rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>
                            justice.” It is the natural law applied to nations in their relations
                            with each other, so far as they have consented that it shall be thus
                            applied. It is wanting in some of the essentials of strict law, however
                            5 it is not prescribed by a common superior, and its only sanction is
                            the public opinion of Christendom. Nor is it a complete code having an
                            established rule for all questions that may arise. It is <pb n="247"
                                xml:id="pg_247" facs="0303"/>yet in the period of its growth; but
                            whenever it does speak it utters the rule which the wisdom of the
                            nations has by common consent found to be most in consonance with reason
                            and natural justice. When it gives a rule for the government of a given
                            case, it furnishes the full measure of international obligation in that
                            case—is the only standard by which conduct in that case can be properly
                            tested. In other words, it ascertains what is “equity and justice”
                            between nations.</p>
                        <p>If seeking to pay a compliment to the eminent men who negotiated the
                            treaty, I think one would hardly choose to say, “they authorized the
                            mixed commission at will to substitute for the rules of right which have
                            been sanctioned by all Christian powers and the courts of both countries
                            the individual notions of the Commissioners thereafter to be
                            chosen.”</p>
                        <p>The application sought of the proposition alluded to is, in substance
                            that, though the facts before the prize-court fully justified its
                            judgments, according to the international law as even the British courts
                            would themselves declare it to-day, yet this commission may, upon some
                            imaginary ground of equity, be bound nevertheless to award damages!. I
                            can only say that no such result can occur here, except over the most
                            emphatic and decided dissent with which I can oppose it.</p>
                        <p>The Science (No. 391) was found at anchor in the roadstead outside the
                            mouth of the Rio Grande, within less than a marine league of the Texas
                            shore, which was blockaded. Her outward cargo, then discharged, had
                            consisted in part of confederate grey cloth, (290 bales.) She was, in
                            fact, consigned to Matamoras, and really had discharged her cargo there.
                            Matamoras was forty miles up the river. The Texas shore was accessible
                            and less than two and a half miles distant. Captured November 5, 1863;
                            had been there since August 12.</p>
                        <p>The Dashing Wave (No. 395) was found at anchor near the Science, but
                            further within American waters. No part of her cargo was war material.
                            There were, however, two boxes (£12,000) of gold coin, £7,000 of which
                            belonged to one Caldwell, whose nationality was unknown, but it is
                            evident he was not British. It appeared from papers on board that at his
                            request Lizardi &amp; Co., British merchants, shipped it as theirs, the
                            bill of lading (p. 193) containing the unusual recital that it was “all
                            British property.” She had discharged no part of her cargo. Caldwell had
                            requested this shipment to be made by Lizardi &amp; Co., as their
                            property, in their name, with £5,000 to be advanced by them to him, if
                            their consignee at Matamoras approved of proposed investments of it. He
                            had specially requested that it be insured,” including the war risk,"
                            (p. 200.) She was, in fact, bound for Matamoras.</p>
                        <p>Caldwell made no claim, but a claim was made on behalf of Lizardi &amp;
                            Co. for the whole £12,000, averring that "no other persons are
                            interested therein,” and sworn to by their attorney. Also, in the same
                            behalf and to the same broad extent, by Armando Brothers, to whom the
                            consignee had indorsed the bill of lading.</p>
                        <p>The Volant (No. 388) was captured in American waters, the same as the
                            Science and Dashing Wave, loaded by same brokers who loaded the Science,
                            and had confederate gray cloth, (15 bales,) being balance of invoice
                            sent by Science. The remainder of her cargo was blankets, shoes, and
                            woolen stockings, and brandy. She had not discharged her cargo. The
                            invoice on board described the cloth (p. 73) as four bales <hi

                            lights were on her at night.</p>
                        <p>A confederate officer, it was sworn, claimed to have received arms from
                            her, landed on the coast of Texas at night; and this was not
                            contradicted, though there was opportunity. There is other strong
                            inculpatory evidence, which is, however, contradicted; tending to show
                            both the inward and outward cargoes to have been confederate
                            property.</p>
                        <p>The question in all these cases Is, whether or not there was probable
                            cause for capture. The cargo of each of them was adapted to the Texan
                            market; and there is little doubt that it was expected ultimately to
                            find sale there, whether first to enter into the general stock of
                            Matamoras, or merely to observe the form of passing through that place
                            in transit to Texas.</p>
                        <p>It seems from the evidence that merchandise unladen at the mouth of the
                            Bio Grande for Matamoras was conveyed to the latter place either in
                            small steamers by the river, or in wagons by land. It seems, also, that
                            this land transportation by wagons was likewise practicable on the Texas
                            side from the coast at the mouth of the river.</p>
                        <p>It was a matter of notoriety that enormous supplies of military as well
                            as other goods for consumption in the confederacy had been introduced
                            through Texas <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>, until the blockade of that
                            coast was made effective, and afterwards through Matamoras. It was
                            equally notorious that there was in Texas a great demand for such goods
                            when these vessels were seized; and that it was the policy of the rebel
                            authorities to ship cotton abroad rather than sell it at home.</p>
                        <p>These considerations are mentioned to show the strong temptations which
                            existed to introduce goods, and especially arms and ammunition, (which
                            could not go through Matamoras,) into Texas direct. And if accomplished
                            it would avoid Mexican custom-house scrutiny, duties, charges and
                            detentions, and all the inconveniences which flow from circuitous and
                            indirect methods.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as watchful Federal cruisers were present almost constantly any
                            attempt by day to put goods upon the Texas shore would have been too
                            hazardous for probable success. If done at all, it must have been under
                            cover of darkness, and in small quantities at a time, and by the use of
                            small boats. This would consume time, and would be greatly facilitated
                            by nearness of the ship to the Texas shore.</p>
                        <p>“The Science.” The foregoing observations apply in all these cases. With
                            a burden of only 300 tons, the length of her visit (nearly three months)
                            was of itself remarkable. She had the strong temptation to violate the
                            blockade, and she had placed herself so near the Texas shore that she
                            had the opportunity to do it. These circumstances of suspicion she
                            created, and did not explain. If a ship may thus put herself so near a
                            blockaded shore for months, where, under cover of the night, she can
                            land her cargo upon it, and this without any peril or cause of
                            suspicion, then, indeed, the right of blockade is less valuable to a
                            belligerent than I believe it to be.</p>
                        <p>I am thus led to the conclusion, not merely that the judgment of the
                            Supreme Court in the case of the Science was not clearly wrong, but that
                            that judgment was clearly right.</p>
                        <p>“The Dashing Wave.” The foregoing remarks apply with equal force to the
                            case of the Dashing Wave, except that she had but recently arrived at
                            the place where she was seized; and in this case there is superadded <pb
                                n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0305"/>the facts concerning the coin
                            of Caldwell. A Mexican would have no occasion thus to conceal his
                            ownership. A Mexican would not have feared to make claim in the prize
                            court. He was either Mexican or confederate, for his country had
                            political troubles. The conclusion is difficult to avoid that he was an
                            enemy, and his property liable to capture, contaminating all that
                            belonged really to Lizardi &amp; Co.</p>
                        <p>I perceive no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court in this case,
                            except in its failure to condemn the coin as lawful prize.</p>
                        <p>“The Volant” is a case much like the Dashing Wave. There was no simulated
                            ownership of cargo, but there was an apparent effort to mislead by the
                            invoice, as to the cloth—to conceal the fact that it was confederate
                            gray.</p>
                        <p>I see no sufficient reason to hold in this that the judgment of the
                            Supreme Court was wrong.</p>
                        <p>“The Sir William Peel” differs from the other cases in the fact that she
                            was captured in Mexican waters, where she had a right to be; though it
                            seems from the evidence that she had previously been in Texan waters. In
                            all other respects the case is stronger against the ship than in either
                            of the others. It is only by giving her the benefit of doubts that I can
                            say she should not have been condemned. I am very clearly of opinion
                            that there was abundant reason for seizing her and sending her in for
                            adjudication.</p>
                        <p>That she was taken in Mexican waters was a violation of the sovereignty
                            of Mexico, but not of the rights of the ship and cargo, which could be
                            interposed for their protection except by Mexico, was the doctrine held
                            by the Supreme Court. I think the proposition is fully supported by
                            reason and the principles of justice; and that it is a sound principle
                            of international law, best in accord with the adjudged cases.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the assessment of damages in the case of the Sir
                            William Peel, Mr. Commissioner Frazer delivered the following dissenting
                            opinion:</p>
                        <p>Concerning the assessment of damages in the case of the Sir William Peel,
                            (the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States being deemed
                            erroneous by my colleagues,) I felt constrained to dissent upon an
                            important point.</p>
                        <p>The ship, and nearly all the cargo, having been restored, it was material
                            to ascertain the value of the property so restored at the date of
                            restitution. If it was then worth as much as when captured, the only
                            legitimate damages, it seemed to me, would beits use during the period
                            of detention, together with costs and expenses. The value, I thought,
                            should be taken at the time and place of restitution, and not at a
                            different time. It had been ascertained at that time by an appraisement
                            by the prize court, one of the appraisers being an agent of the
                            claimants. This appraisement was in round numbers, in gold, £67,500. But
                            the claimants chose, at very great expense, to take the property to
                            England, where they sold it, realizing only £39,600; from which has been
                            deducted all expenses of removal to England, insurance, and other
                            expenses of its preservation and care after restitution, (a very
                            considerable aggregate,) and these net proceeds, deducted from the value
                            at the time of capture, have been taken as a part of the damages
                            awarded. I could not resist the conclusion that the claimants had, after
                            restitution, sacrificed the property for but little more than half its
                            value; and I could not agree that the United States should suffer that
                            loss. It constitutes about three-fourths of the large sum awarded in the
                            case.</p>

                        <p>The only lawful object of a blockade is to injure the enemy. Hence there
                            cannot, consistently with public law, be a blockade of a port unless it
                            be an enemy’s port.</p>
                        <p>But I am not prepared say that the mere occupancy of a port, however
                            precarious and temporary, by the belligerent maintaining the blockade
                            thereof, is such a possession as makes the port no longer the enemy’s,
                            but that of the blockading belligerent, thereby terminating the
                            blockade. I know of no authority which goes to that extent. In such a
                            case I think the question must be regarded as one of first impression,
                            open to the just influence of every consideration which should affect
                            the decision of a new question.</p>
                        <p>But I do not think this question is necessarily involved in the decision
                            of the cases growing out of the capture and condemnation of the
                            Circassian, and therefore I do not discuss it.</p>
                        <p>There has been much criticism of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
                            case of the Circassian, (2 Wall., 135.) That judgment has been
                            questioned in quarters entitled to great respect; and it has, on such
                            occasions, uniformly, I believe, been assumed that at the date of the
                            capture of the vessel, (May 4, 1862,) the port of New Orleans was in the
                            possession of the United States, a possession which subsequent
                            events-proved to be (whatever may have been apprehended at the time)
                            permanent and uninterrupted. And it has been assumed that the Supreme
                            Court held that, under such circumstances, the blockade of the port was
                            not brought to an end, This is a grave misapprehension, not only of
                            historical facts but of the doctrine announced by the Supreme Court; and
                            yet so easy to fall into, that only by care can it be avoided. It is
                            undoubtedly a fact of history that for several days prior to the capture
                            at sea, of this ship, the military forces of the United States had
                            actual possession of the city of New Orleans, were not there immediately
                            menaced by any hostile force, and ever after held it. It is so natural
                            to confound the city with the port of New Orleans that the error is not
                            wonderful. And yet the distinction is very wide, and practically very
                            important.</p>
                        <p>The city of New Orleans, of which the United States held possession, was
                            a municipal corporation, possessing geographical boundaries defined by
                            the laws of the State of Louisiana, The boundaries included, at the
                            utmost, only so much of that larger territory called the parish of
                            Orleans as lies on the left bank of the Mississippi River. But the
                            National Government, having by the Constitution the control of commerce,
                            and consequently the power to define the geographical limits of the
                            ports of the United States, had, by act of Congress taking effect
                            September 16, 1850, declared “that the port of New Orleans shall be and
                            is hereby so extended as to embrace the whole parish of New Orleans, on
                            both sides of the Mississippi River.” (9 Stat, at L., 458.) It was not
                            the city merely, but the whole port which had been blockaded. And the
                            question before the Supreme Court was not whether the possession of a
                            port by a blockading belligerent puts an end to the blockade. It is a
                            disregard of the facts so to state it, and it is a misapprehension of
                            the decision of the court to suppose that it was reached by determining
                            that question in the negative. The real question was deemed by the
                            majority of the court to be whether possession of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >city</hi> by the United States terminated its blockade <pb n="251"
                                xml:id="pg_251" facs="0307"/>of the <hi rend="italic">port</hi> It
                            needs only a careful reading of the opinion of the Chief Justice to see
                            that he saw clearly the difference between the city and the port of New
                            Orleans; and an examination of the dissenting opinion of Judge Nelson
                            will also show that he entirely confounded the city with the port.</p>
                        <p>Is it possible to misunderstand the following language found in the
                            opinion of the Chief Justice?</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>It (the blockade) applied not to the city alone, but controlled the

                                blockade unnecessary, and would supersede it. But at the time of the
                                capture of the Circassian there was <hi rend="italic">no such
                                    possession</hi>. Only the <hi rend="italic">city</hi> was
                                occupied, <hi rend="italic">not the port.</hi></p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Nothing can be more certain than that the Chief Justice <hi rend="italic"
                                >thought</hi> there-was an important and very practical distinction
                            between the city and the port of New Orleans with reference to the
                            question of blockade. If not, then this language, marking so clearly the
                            difference between the two things, and dwelling upon the fact that
                            though the city was occupied by the Federal forces, a very large part of
                            the port was not so occupied, was idle verbiage, injected into the
                            opinion for no purpose unless it may have been to increase its
                            volume!</p>
                        <p>I think the Chief Justice was correct in supposing that the
                            difference-between the city and the port was of practical importance in
                            the case. A little consideration will make this quite apparent.</p>
                        <p>No rebel military force, it is true, occupied that part of the port (the
                            right bank of the river, many miles in length) which was not occupied by
                            the United States on the 4th May, 1862; but it was, <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi>, territory of the rebel belligerent, nevertheless. Trade
                            there was trade with the enemy, to prevent which is the lawful purpose
                            of blockade. It is not necessary to the lawful blockade of an enemy’s
                            port that the enemy should hold it by the presence of a military force.
                            Suppose, then, that on the 4th May, 1862, the Circassian had steamed
                            into the port with a view to discharge her cargo at any landing on the
                            right bank of the river, within the port, rebel merchants,
                            non-combatants, being ready to receive it there and transport it into
                            the interior, no portion of the goods being contraband, by what right,
                            save that of blockade, could the Federal fleet have interfered to
                            prevent it? The position and strength of that fleet, it is true, enabled
                            it to capture, without fail, every vessel which might have attemped such
                            a thing; but this physical ability to capture did not, <hi rend="italic"
                                >per se</hi>, confer the right to exercise it; nor did it, <hi
                                rend="italic">per se</hi>, end the blockade. It is said that a
                            municipal regulation might have been enacted prohibiting such
                            importations or controlling them; and in execution of such an enactment
                            the force at hand could have been employed; but this is no relief from
                            the dilemma. The right by municipal regulations to close rebel ports and
                            render trade-with them unlawful, was claimed by the United States very
                            early in the rebellion. It was proposed, but the right to do so was
                            denied by Great Britain and other neutral nations, and its exercise was
                            forborne-in deference to their protests. Even in the argument for the
                            claimant in these cases, the right of the United States to exercise
                            sovereign rights (and belligerent rights at the same time) against the
                            rebels to the prejudice of neutrals, is earnestly combatted by a
                            gentleman who, as a writer upon public law, stands deservedly high as an
                            authority, and who, in his published works, had before expressed the
                            same opinion. Whatever <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0308"/>maybe
                            true as to that, it is very certain that Great Britain, having
                            contributed more than any other nation to induce the United States to
                            forbear, by denying the right, cannot now fairly claim for her subjects
                            the benefit of a principle which, at the time, she so stoutly denied.
                            Municipal regulations prohibiting neutral import trade with any part of
                            the port of New Orleans not in Federal possession, would have been as
                            obnoxious to Great Britain as if a like attempt had been made at that
                            time concerning Mobile, Charleston, or Savannah. The principle which
                            would have justified it in the one case, would have maintained it in
                            all.</p>
                        <p>If the consideration of the case left it doubtful whether the judgment of
                            the Supreme Court was in accordance with public law, it would be our
                            plain duty, according to all authority, to disallow these claims. So
                            much deference in a case of doubt is due to a deliberate judgment of a
                            court whose independence, impartiality, and learning has given it a
                            character in Great Britain not less lofty than it possesses at home.</p>
                        <p>But I do not doubt. Comments and criticisms upon the judgment of the
                            court had fallen under my eye; trusting to which, I confess I had been
                            somewhat impressed with serious doubts (to say the least) of the
                            legality of the condemnation. But a very careful study of the case shows
                            that, in making such criticisms, no account has been taken of the
                            important fact that the possession of the United States forces at New
                            Orleans did not extend to the whole port when the ship was seized; no
                            such entire possession being anywhere directly asserted. That the error
                            is one of inference, resulting from the fact, doubtless, that the wider
                            area of the port, as contradistinguished from the city of the same name,
                            has usually escaped attention. It follows, therefore, that the principle
                            supposed to be violated by the court was really not violated at all, and
                            that the question was not that which has been sometimes supposed. It is
                            not, I may hope, improper to say that the best care and judgment which I
                            am able to bring to the consideration of the case has resulted in a
                            clear conviction that the condemnation of the Circassian was
                            correct.</p>

                        <p>The allowance of prospective earnings by vessels was denied by the

                            as I am aware, allowed by the municipal law of any civilized nation
                            anywhere. The reason is obvious and universally recognized among
                            jurists. It is not possible to ascertain such earnings with any
                            approximation to certainty. There are a thousand unknown contingencies,
                            the happening of any of which will render incorrect any estimate of
                            them, and hence result in injustice.</p>
                        <p>Who can say that the Monmouth would have reached Savannah at all? That
                            she could have procured a cargo of cotton at ¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.
                            per pound, the lowest freight in proof? Who can say that she would have
                            got better or as good rates as that? Why could she have done better?
                            There is no reason. Who can say that she could have been laden and
                            sailed before the blockade would have stopped her? The witnesses do <pb
                                n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0309"/>not say so, but only “if she
                            had met no detention or accident.” Can this commission say so? It is
                            palpable that we can only conjecture, and conjecture is no fit basis for
                            an award of damages. We should have had evidence more satisfactory from
                            the claimant, such as the prevailing rate of charter of such a vessel at
                            the time and place. Under such circumstances we are left to estimate the
                            value of the vessel for return-cargo upon very unsatisfactory evidence.
                            I base my estimate upon cotton-freight at ¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per
                            pound, because there is, in my judgment, a greater probability, in view
                            of all contingencies, that this is above rather than below a just
                            estimate.</p>
                        <p>These observations apply also to the case of the Boyne, heretofore
                            decided. I now doubt whether this is not too much. It assumes that each
                            contingency would have been avoided, the happening of any one of which
                            would have prevented this vessel from doing as well as some others; and
                            this assumption in favor of the claimant is quite as much as, in my
                            judgment, we may make, with due regard to public law, as declared at
                            Geneva, and to the principles of justice, as recognized everywhere.</p>
                        <p>The Monmouth, (No. 315.), The President, by proclamation of April 19,
                            1861, gave public notice of a purpose to blockade the ports of South
                            Carolina, Georgia, and of the States south thereof, announcing that a
                            “competent force <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be posted" for that
                            purpose. The proclamation announced further that any vessel approaching
                            or attempting to leave “either of said ports” with a view to violate
                            “such blockade,” would be warned by the commander of “one of the
                            blockading vessels,” who would indorse such warning and the date thereof
                            on her register, and any subsequent attempt of the same vessel to enter
                            or leave “<hi rend="italic">the blockaded port</hi>” (certainly meaning
                            every port covered by the warning) would result in capture. It cannot be
                            supposed that it was intended that this warning was to be repeated off
                            each port blockaded.</p>
                        <p>In these cases the warning was by a vessel blockading Charleston and off
                            that port <hi rend="italic">before</hi> there was any actual blockading
                            force off Savannah, and was indorsed thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Boarded, informed of the blockade, and warned off the coast of
                                    all the Southern States by the United States steamship Niagara,
                                    May 12, 1861.</p>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This warning was not, and is not, disavowed. It must, therefore, have the
                            same effect as if the officer giving it had been expressly instructed by
                            the highest authority to give it in that form. It must be regarded as
                            the act of the United States, and was notice to the vessel that all the
                            Southern ports embraced within the proclamation were then actually
                            blockaded, and that any subsequent attempt of the vessel warned to enter
                            any of such ports would result in capture.</p>
                        <p>A vessel bound for Savannah, thus warned, it is true, might have
                            disregarded the warning, and could lawfully have proceeded to Savannah
                            because there was not, in fact, any force blockading that port. If
                            captured she would, unquestionably, have been discharged with damages by
                            the prize court.</p>
                        <p>But must the neutral merchantman run the hazard of attempting to enter
                            Savannah? Had she found there an actual blockade and been captured, her
                            previous warning would have been good, and her condemnation as good
                            prize would have been certain. There is in the facts every element of a
                            strong obligation upon the United States, and in favor of a vessel
                            which, on the faith of the warning given, fully respected <pb n="254"
                                xml:id="pg_254" facs="0310"/>it, and by so doing suffered loss, to
                            make good that loss. The neutral vessel, ignorant as to the facts, had a
                            right to act upon the warning; and I am compelled to hold that, in doing
                            so, she acted with all prudence and propriety, and that, judging, as her
                            captors must at the time, any other course would have been rashness and
                            folly. A regard for the interests of his owners, as well as respect for
                            the United States, required that the master should abandon any purpose
                            to enter Savannah.</p>
                        <p>These observations apply also to Nos. 216 and 467.</p>

                                which I have received from Earl Granville, I have the honor to state
                                that her Majesty’s government deem it of importance to the good
                                relations which they are ever anxious should subsist and be
                                strengthened between the United States and Great Britain, that a
                                friendly and complete understanding should be come to between the
                                two governments as to the extent of the rights which belong to the
                                citizens of the United States and Her Majesty’s subjects,
                                respectively, with reference to the fisheries on the coasts of Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America, and as to any other
                                questions between them which affect the relations of the United
                                States toward those possessions.</p>
                            <p>As the consideration of these matters would, however, involve
                                investigations of a somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very
                                desirable that they should be thoroughly examined, I am directed by
                                Lord Granville to propose to the Government of the United States the
                                appointment of a joint high commission, which shall be composed of
                                members to be named by each government; shall hold its sessions at
                                Washington; and shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the
                                different questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well
                                as all those which affect the relations of the United States toward
                                Her Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I am confident that this proposal will be met by your Government in
                                the same cordial spirit of friendship which has induced Her
                                Majesty’s government to tender it, and I cannot doubt that in that
                                case the result will not fail to contribute to the maintenance of
                                the good relations between the two countries which I am convinced
                                the Government of the United States, as well as that of Her Majesty,
                                equally have at heart.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your

                                compliance with instructions from Earl Granville, that Her Majesty’s
                                government deem it of importance to the good relations which they
                                are ever anxious should subsist and be strengthened between the

                                the rights which belong to the citizens of the United States and Her
                                Majesty’s subjects, respectively, with reference to the fisheries on
                                the coast of Her Majesty’s possessions in North America, and as to
                                any other questions between them which affect the relations of the
                                United States toward those possessions; and, further, that as the
                                consideration of these questions would involve investigations of a
                                somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very desirable that they
                                should be thoroughly examined, you are directed by Lord Granville to
                                propose to the Government of the United States the appointment of a
                                joint high commission, which shall be composed of members to be
                                named by each government; shall hold its sessions at Washington; and
                                shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the different
                                questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well as all
                                those which affect the relations of the United States toward Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I have laid your note before the President, who instructs me to say
                                that he shares with Her Majesty’s government the appreciation of the
                                importance of a friendly and complete understanding between the two
                                governments with reference to the subjects specially suggested for
                                the consideration of the proposed joint high commission, and he
                                fully recognizes the friendly spirit which has prompted the
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>The President is, however, of the opinion that without the adjustment
                                of a class of questions not alluded to in your note, the proposed
                                high commission would fail to establish the permanent relations and
                                the sincere, substantial, and lasting friendship between the two
                                governments which, in common with Her Majesty’s government, he
                                desires should prevail.</p>
                            <p>He thinks that the removal of the differences which arose during the
                                rebellion in the United States, and which have existed since then,
                                growing out of the acts committed by the several vessels which have
                                given rise to the claims generically known as the “Alabama” claims,
                                will also be essential to the restoration of cordial and amicable
                                relations between the two governments. He directs me to say that,
                                should Her Majesty’s government accept this view of this matter, and
                                assent that this subject also may be treated of by the proposed high
                                commission, and may thus be put in the way of a final and amicable
                                settlement, this Government will, with much pleasure, appoint high
                                commissioners on the part of the United States, to meet those who
                                may be appointed on behalf of Her Majesty’s government, and will
                                spare no efforts to secure, at the earliest practicable moment, a
                                just and amicable arrangement of all the questions which now
                                unfortunately stand in the way of an entire and abiding friendship
                                between the two nations.</p>

                            <p>With reference to that part of it in which you state that the

                                during the rebellion in the United States, and which have existed

                                inform you that I have submitted to Earl Granville the opinion thus
                                expressed by the President of the United States, the friendliness of
                                which, I beg you to believe, I fully appreciate.</p>
                            <p>I am now authorized by his lordship to state that it would give Her
                                Majesty’s government great satisfaction if the claims commonly known
                                by the name of the “Alabama" claims were submitted to the
                                consideration of the same high commission by which Her Majesty’s
                                government have proposed that the questions relating to the British
                                possessions in North America should be discussed, provided that all

                                this country, are similarly referred to the same commission. The
                                expressions made use of in the name of the President in your
                                above-mentioned note with regard to the “Alabama” claims convince me
                                that the Government of the United States will consider it of
                                importance that these causes of dispute between the two countries
                                should also, and at the same time, be done away with, and that you
                                will enable me to convey to my government the assent of the
                                President to the addition which they thus propose to the duties of
                                the high commission, and which cannot fail to make it more certain
                                that its labors will lead to the removal of all differences between
                                the two countries.</p>

                                    to the United States; that I have not yielded a voluntary
                                    support to any pretended government, authority, power, or
                                    constitution, within the United States, hostile or inimical
                                    thereto. And I do further swear (or affirm) that, to the best of
                                    my knowledge and ability, I will support and defend the

                                    and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the
                                    same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental
                                    reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and
                                    faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am
                                    about to enter: so help me God.</p>

                            <p>It is hoped that this memorandum, which has been prepared in this
                                Department, may aid you by its references in the consideration of
                                the several questions on which it treats.</p>
                            <p>The President commits the discussion and treatment of the several
                                questions to the joint discretion of yourself and your
                                associates.</p>
                            <p>The sittings of the commission being in this city, you will have the
                                opportunity, of which he expects you to avail yourself, of
                                consulting with him from time to time, and upon any points in which
                                you may have serious doubts, and you can also cautiously and
                                confidentially ascertain the views and opinions of Senators, to
                                whom, in case your negotiations shall result in a treaty or
                                convention, that result must be submitted for their constitutional
                                advice and consent.</p>
                            <p>One point not referred to in the accompanying memorandum will,
                                probably be brought to the consideration of the Joint Commission,
                                viz: Some agreement between the two Governments defining their
                                respective rights and duties as neutrals in case the other
                                Government be engaged in war with a third power.</p>
                            <p>It is enough that the subject be indicated and your attention to it
                                asked as one of the important questions that may engage the
                                considerations of the commission.</p>

                            <p>The President hopes that whatever principles may be established or
                                recognized in connection with this subject shall be considered
                                equally applicable to the period covered by the late civil war in
                                this country and the future.</p>

                            <p>The convention of 1818, hereinafter referred to, gives to American
                                fishermen—</p>
                            <p>1. The right, in common with British fishermen, to <hi rend="italic"
                                    >fish</hi> within three marine miles of the land on all the
                                coasts marked red, blue, and yellow, respectively, on the annexed
                                map.</p>
                            <p>2. Prior to the negotiation of the treaty of 1818, France had secured
                                for her fishermen, by treaty with Great Britain, a similar right on
                                all the coasts marked red. Hence it follows that the American
                                fishermen, as to that portion of the coast, enjoy the right <hi
                                    rend="italic">to fish</hi> in common with the French as well as
                                the British fishermen.</p>
                            <p>3. The additional right as to the coast marked blue to <hi
                                    rend="italic">land, and dry, and cure</hi> fish, so long as the
                                coast is unsettled.</p>
                            <p>[As to this right, it is to be observed that it is said to be
                                important as to the cod-fisheries, but unimportant as to the
                                mackerel-fisheries. The cod are usually split and dried on shore;
                                the mackerel are cured on board.]</p>
                            <p>4. The “privilege” is also reserved to the American fishermen to
                                enter the British North American bays or harbors, not included
                                within the limits of coast so marked in colors, “for the purpose of
                                shelter and of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood, and of
                                obtaining water, and for no other purpose whatever.”</p>
                            <p>[The United States claim that this is a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >privilege</hi> to their fishing-vessels to go in and out of
                                those bays and harbors for the purposes named without the
                                custom-house formalities, and is not to be confounded with the <hi
                                    rend="italic">right</hi> which all vessels which bear the flag
                                of the United States have to enter the open British ports for the
                                purpose of trade, or any other purpose lawful under the customs of
                                nations.]</p>
                            <p>5. Except as above defined, the United States renounce forever the
                                liberty to take, dry, or cure fish within three marine miles of any
                                of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of the British dominions in
                                America.</p>

                                    fisheries.</hi></p>
                            <p>The fisheries are known as the <hi rend="italic">deep-sea</hi> and
                                the <hi rend="italic">in-shore</hi> fisheries.</p>
                            <p>The latter are principally for herring and mackerel; and are
                                understood to have been the principal cause of the trouble. The

                                American fishing-vessels engaged in the deep-sea fisheries off the
                                coasts of the British North American provinces is, as near as can be
                                estimated, about 1,400, with an aggregate tonnage of nearly 100,000
                                tons, employing about 17,000 men. They pursue the fisheries on the
                                banks of Newfoundland, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and on the
                                western banks. On the banks the fisheries are pursued for cod and
                                halibut, and in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence principally for mackerel.
                                The capital employed in these fisheries is estimated at between
                                eight and nine millions. The aggregate annual yield is about seven
                                millions of dollars. The deep-sea fisheries are exclusive of the <hi

                                by the abrogation of the reciprocity treaty. During the existence of

                            <p>Mr. E. H. Derby, of Boston, says: “The fisheries of the State of

                                about twelve millions of dollars, of which less than a sixth are
                                usually drawn from our fisheries in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.”

                                of peace that closed the war of 1812. The United States
                                commissioners claimed that the treaty of 1783 conferred no new
                                rights upon the United States; that it was an agreement as to a
                                division of property which took place on the division of the British
                                empire after the success of the American Revolution, and was not in
                                that respect abrogated by war. The British commissioners, on the
                                other hand, held that, while the treaty of 1783 recognized the <hi

                                they have not been renewed by stipulation in the present treaty, the
                                subjects of the United States can have no pretense to any right to

                                the 17th of September, shows that the only material change made, so
                                far as the present discussion is concerned, was in the exclusion of
                                the word “<hi rend="italic">bait</hi>.” It is represented that the
                                “bait” referred to in the treaty must have been bait for "<hi
                                    rend="italic">cod</hi>, which were caught in those waters, as
                                the mackerel-fisheries in those waters did not begin till several
                                years after that time. It was, therefore, within the letter and
                                spirit of the convention to deny to American fishermen the right to
                                    <hi rend="italic">catch</hi> that bait in those waters. The
                                favorite bait for the mackerel is said to be caught only off the
                                coast of Maine, and not to be found in Canadian waters. If this is
                                correct, it could not have been intended to deny to our fishermen
                                the right to <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi> that bait in British
                                ports.</p>

                                and instructed him to “immediately remonstrate against the illegal

                                waters “within three miles of a line drawn from headland to
                                headland, instead of from the indents of the shores of the
                                provinces.” 2. That the authorities of Nova Scotia had “put upon the
                                stipulations of the treaty [as to the entry to harbors, &amp;c.] a
                                construction directly in conflict with their object, and entirely
                                subversive of the rights and interests of the citizens of the United

                                said to be untenable, “that the Gut of Can so is a narrow strip of
                                water completely within and dividing several counties of the

                            <p>It resulted from this note that the law-officers of the Crown were
                                inquired of and gave their opinions: 1. Sustaining the colonial
                                “headland” doctrine, on the assumption that the word “headland” is
                                used in the convention. No such word is there found. 2. Giving an
                                answer as to the use of ports, which is immaterial in the present
                                aspect, but which was favorable to the American fishermen so far as
                                it went. 3. Say nothing about the objectionable clauses in the law.
                                4. Affirming the colonial doctrine about the Gut of Canso. (<hi

                                        precluded from entering the bays or harbors of the British

                                        damages, and obtaining wood and water. A bay, as is usually
                                        understood, is an arm or recess of the sea entering from the
                                        ocean between capes and headlands, and the term is applied
                                        equally to small and large tracts of water thus situated; it

                                        or recesses ought to be opened to American fishermen as
                                        freely as the sea itself to within three marine miles of the

                                        fish, on the shores and hays of Newfoundland, but they had
                                        that right on the <hi rend="italic">coasts, bays,
                                            harbors</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">creeks</hi> of Nova
                                        Scotia; and as they must land to care fish on the shores,
                                        bays, and creeks, they were evidently admitted to the shores
                                            <hi rend="italic">of the bays, &amp;c.</hi>. By the
                                        treaty of 1818 the same right is granted to cure fish on the
                                        coasts, bays, &amp;c., of Newfoundland, but the Americans
                                        relinquish that right <hi rend="italic">and the right to

                                            >coasts, bays, &amp;c., of Nova Scotia</hi>. Taking it
                                        for granted that the framers of the treaty intended that the
                                        words “bay or bays” should have the same meaning in all
                                        cases, and no mention being made of headlands, there appears
                                        no doubt that the Washington, in fishing ten miles from the
                                        shore, violated no stipulations of the treaty.</p>
                                    <p>It was urged, on behalf of the British government, that by
                                        coasts, bays, &amp;c., is understood an imaginary line,
                                        drawn along the coast from headland to headland, and that
                                        the jurisdiction of Her Majesty extends three marine miles
                                        outside of this line; thus closing all the bays on the coast
                                        or shore, and that great body of water called the Bay of
                                        Fundy, against Americans and others, making the latter a
                                        British bay. This doctrine of headlands is new, and has
                                        received a proper limit in the convention between France and
                                        Great Britain of 2d August, 1839, in which “it is agreed
                                        that the distance of three miles fixed as the general limit
                                        for the exclusive right of fishery upon the coasts of the
                                        two countries shall, with respect to bays, the mouths of
                                        which do not exceed ten miles in width, be measured from a
                                        straight line drawn from headland to headland.”</p>
                                    <p>The Bay of Fundy is from 65 to 75 miles wide and 130 to 140
                                        miles long; it has several bays on its coasts; thus the word
                                        bay, as applied to this great body of water, has the same
                                        meaning as that applied to the Bay of Biscay, the Bay of
                                        Bengal, over which no nation can have the right to assume
                                        the sovereignty. One of the headlands of the Bay of Fundy is
                                        in the United States, and ships bound to Passamaquoddy must
                                        sail through a large space of it. The islands of Grand Menan
                                        (British) and Little Menan (American) are situated nearly on
                                        a line from headland to headland. These islands, as
                                        represented in all geographies, are situate in the Atlantic
                                        Ocean. The conclusion is, therefore, in my mind irresistible
                                        that the Bay of Fundy is not a British bay, nor a bay within
                                        the meaning of the word, as used in the treaties of 1783 and
                                        1818. (<hi rend="italic">Report of Decisions of Commission,

                            <p>The President states in his Annual Message (December, 1870) that this
                                river constitutes a material outlet to the ocean for eight States,
                                with an aggregate population of about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and
                                with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367 tons upon the waters which
                                discharge into it.</p>
                            <p>During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay
                                demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States
                                to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the
                                congress of Vienna, in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all
                                nations, showed the judgment of European jurists and statesmen that
                                the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes
                                have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river to and
                                into the sea, even though passing through the territories of another
                                power. This right does not exclude the co-equal right of the
                                sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouches
                                into the sea to make such regulations relative to the police of the
                                navigation as may be reasonably necessary but those regulations
                                should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not
                                impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right of
                                transit. (6 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations, folio pages</hi>
                                757 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 777.)</p>
                            <p>If the claim made by Mr. Clay was just when the population of States
                                bordering on the shores of the lakes was only three million four
                                hundred thousand, it now derives greater force and equity from the
                                increased population, wealth, production, and tonnage of the States
                                on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in
                                behalf of our right, the principle for which he contended has been
                                frequently, and by various nations, recognized by law or by treaty,
                                and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty
                                concluded at Mayence, in 1831, the Rhine was declared free from the
                                point where it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention
                                between Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1835, the navigation of the
                                Douro, throughout its whole extent, was made free for the subjects
                                of both crowns. In 1853 the Argentine Confederation, by treaty,
                                threw open the free navigation of the Parana and the Uruguay to the
                                merchant-vessels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean war was closed
                                by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube. In
                                1858 Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon
                                and La Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of national law,
                                as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all
                                nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in
                                December,.1866, the Emperor of Brazil, by imperial decree, declared
                                the Amazon to be open, to the frontier of Brazil, to the
                                merchant-ships of all nations. Sir Robert Phillimore, the greatest
                                living British authority on this subject, while asserting the
                                abstract right of the British claim, says: “It seems difficult to
                                deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict <hi
                                    rend="italic">law;</hi> but it is equally difficult to deny,
                                first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard
                                law; secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of
                                the St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsistency with
                                her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On
                                the ground <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0348"/>that she
                                possesses a small domain, in which the Mississippi took its rise,
                                she insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its
                                waters. On the ground that she possesses both banks of the St.
                                Lawrence where it disembogues itself into the sea, she denies to the
                                United States the right of navigation, though about half the waters
                                of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake
                                Michigan, through which the river flows, are the property of the
                                United States.” (See Phillimore’s International Law, vol. 1, page
                                167 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>, where the authorities are

                            <p>The canals in aid of the lake and Saint Lawrence navigation are: 1.
                                The Sault Ste. Marie Canal, in the dominions of the United States.
                                Vessels between Lake Huron and Lake Superior must pass through this
                                canal. 2. The Saint Clair Canal, in the dominions of the United
                                States, which is a deepening of the channel to the depth of fourteen
                                feet. 3. The Well and Canal, in British dominions, from Lake Erie to
                                Lake Ontario. 4. Several canals between Lake Ontario and tidewater,
                                in the aggregate about forty miles in length. 5. The canal between
                                Lake Champlain and the river Saint Lawrence. Neither of the Canadian
                                canals have at present the capacity of the American canals.</p>
                            <p><seg type="margin">1870, July 12.</seg> A confidential memorandum was
                                submitted by Great Britain as the basis of proposed arrangements on
                                the subject of the navigation of the Saint Lawrence, and other
                                inland waters of British North America, &amp;c. This was in
                                substance as follows: That if a satisfactory reciprocity-treaty
                                could be made, the United States should be restored to the enjoyment
                                of the fisheries as under the old reciprocity-treaty; and also to
                                the navigation of the inland waters of Canada; provided, further,
                                that like permission in the United States should be granted to
                                Canada. Canada was also willing to further agree to enlarge and
                                improve the access to the ocean, provided she could have assurance
                                of the permanency of the arrangement for reciprocity. The proposal
                                further contemplated throwing open the coasting-trade to each party;
                                reciprocal patent and copyright laws; arrangements for a reciprocal
                                transit trade; extension of the provisions of the extradition
                                treaties, and a re-adjustment of the Canadian excise-duty.</p>

                                United States and other nations with the British provinces of Canada
                                and others north and east of the United States was burdened with a
                                system of differential duties which discriminated against foreign
                                importations in favor of British to such an extent as to prevent any
                                extensive importations into those provinces from the United
                                States.</p>

                                preceding the reciprocity-treaty, averaged about eleven millions of

                            <p>In 1845 the British government changed their colonial commercial
                                policy by authorizing the Canadian legislature to regulate their own
                                tariff. In 1846 the Canadian legislature removed the existing
                                differential duties, and admitted American manufactures and foreign

                                agricultural products has failed because they have generously,
                                without stipulations, conceded many commercial advantages which it
                                was in their power to bestow; and that their only mode of securing
                                desired privileges is to revoke concessions made. His attention had
                                been drawn to two resolutions which passed the Senate on the

                                differential duties from American productions; that had Canada at
                                that time stipulated that in return for her admission of American
                                manufactures, the duties should be removed from her products, it
                                would have been the interest of the United States to have agreed to
                                it. No such proposition, however, was made; and the very important
                                concession scarcely attracted attention in the United States.

                                of the 4th December, 1852, to Mr. Ingersoll, wrote that some
                                progress was made by Mr. Webster in preparations to negotiate with
                                Mr. Crampton on the fisheries and commercial reciprocity. President
                                still desirous that negotiation should proceed; and it would be
                                taken up as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>President Fillmore sent to Congress, on the 7th February, 1853, a
                                message, inclosing report from Secretary of State, giving the state
                                of the pending negotiation, which he, Mr. Everett, said had been
                                dilligently pursued; reported the willingness of British government
                                to arrange the fishery question. Refers to desire for reciprocal
                                free trade.</p>
                            <p>Refers also to a resolution on the subject which passed the House
                                some time previously, and to the attention paid to the subject by
                                Congress. Time necessarily to be consumed in the negotiation in
                                consequence of necessity of British minister referring to London for
                                instructions, would probably render impossible the conclusion of a
                                comprehensive arrangement that session. Meantime recommends that a
                                bill admitting provincial fish free, on condition that United States
                                fishermen are admitted to full participation of provincial
                                fisheries, be passed that session. (<hi rend="italic">Ho. Reps., Ex.

                                discussed with Mr. Crampton the questions involved in the proposed

                                from Mr. Marcy to Mr. Crampton, submitting a <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Says the third article is a new one, inserted to bring in northwest

                                restriction made to any part of United States coasts; therefore it
                                is but fair to open Pacific coast of British possessions to United
                                States fishermen. Has introduced in article 2 a clause excepting
                                coast of Florida, not on account of value of fisheries, but
                                apprehended interference with slave population by free blacks from
                                Bahamas, and partly also from apprehended interference with rights
                                of wreckers. Has excepted also shell-fish, to prevent
                                misapprehension. Has amended the expression in the first article of

                                    agree upon the name of such third person, they shall each name a
                                    person, and it shall be determined by lot which of the two
                                    persois so named shall be the arbitrator or umpire in cases of
                                    difference or disagreement between the commissioners. The person
                                    so to be chosen to be arbitrator or umpire shall, before
                                    proceeding to act as such in any case, make and subscribe a
                                    solemn declaration in a form similar to that which shall already
                                    have been made and subscribed by the commissioners, which shall
                                    be entered on the record of their proceedings. In the event of

                                    appointed or named as aforesaid to act as such commissioner,

                                    originally appointed or named as aforesaid, and shall make and
                                    subscribe such declaration as aforesaid.</p>
                                <p>Such commissioners shall proceed to examine the coasts of the
                                    North American provinces and of the United States, embraced
                                    within the provisions of the first and second articles of this
                                    treaty, and shall designate the places reserved by the said

                            <p>Seventeenth March, 1870, Sir E. Thornton wrote to Mr. Fish a private
                                and confidential letter. He had a reply to inquiries made at Mr.
                                Fish’s suggestion, whether the Canadian government would grant the
                                free navigation of the Welland Canal and Saint Lawrence, <pb n="302"
                                    xml:id="pg_302" facs="0360"/>and put the canal into a proper
                                state for navigation, in return for a considerable reduction in the
                                import duties in this country on lumber, salt, fish, and coal, or a
                                possible abolition of all duty on the first three articles. In
                                reply, Canadian government regrets absence from the proposal of
                                products of the most populous sections of Dominion. Of the four
                                articles named, without knowing how much the duty on coal could be
                                diminished, they consider that the free importation of fish would be
                                the only satisfactory part of the proposal. 1870, Mar. 17.</p>

                                subject to certain rates of duty.</p>
                            <p>Schedule No. 1 is a free list; No. 2 a list of articles to pay a
                                certain import duty in both countries. If they are adopted by United
                                States, or propose not unacceptable modifications, free navigation
                                of the Saint Lawrence and the use of the canals will be granted; and
                                he is authorized to declare that it is the policy of Canada to
                                maintain the greatest efficiency in canals. Asks early answer.</p>

                            <p>By the 1st article of the treaty between the United States and Great
                                Britain of the 15th of June, 1816, it was stipulated that the line
                                of boundary between the territories of the parties on the
                                forty-ninth parallel should stop in the middle of the channel which
                                separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island, and should proceed
                                thence southerly through the middle of that channel and of Fuca’s
                                Straits, to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                            <p>The point in dispute between the two governments is, as to which
                                channel was meant by the words referred to. On the part of the
                                United States it is contended that no other than the Haro, and on
                                the part of Great Britain that no other than the Rosario Channel
                                could have been in contemplation.</p>
                            <p>The United States also contend that the history of the negotiation
                                shows that, in abandoning a claim to have the boundary of the
                                forty-ninth parallel extended to the Pacific, and thereby
                                relinquishing the whole of Vancouver’s Island to Great Britain, they
                                were actuated by an expectation that all other islands south of that
                                parallel and east of the Haro Channel would fall to them. The United
                                States also contend that the parties could not have supposed that
                                any other channel was meant than the widest, the deepest, and the
                                shortest between the Straits of Fuca and the mouth of Fraser River,
                                which conditions are only fulfilled by the Haro Channel; that the
                                navigation to and from Fuca’s Straits by the Rosario Channel is
                                comparatively circuitous, and that if that channel were to be the
                                line, it would throw into the possession of Great Britain all the
                                islands below the forty-ninth parallel and east of Vancouver.</p>
                            <p>The objects and intentions of the parties in agreeing to the first
                                article of the treaty of the 15th June, 1846, seem to be well
                                illustrated by the following antecedents to that instrument:</p>
                            <p>By the third article of the treaty between the United States and
                                Great Britain of the 20th October, 1818, the parties agreed to a
                                joint occupation of the territory which they might respectively
                                claim on the northwest coast of America west of the Rocky
                                Mountains.</p>
                            <p>By their treaty with Spain of the 22d of February, 1819, the United
                                States acquired any title which the latter may have had in the same
                                territory north of the forty-second parallel of latitude.</p>
                            <p>By their treaty with Great Britain of the 6th of August, 1827, the
                                joint occupation of the territory referred to was indefinitely
                                extended, upon the condition that if, after the 20th of October,
                                1828, either party should give twelve months’ notice to the other,
                                the convention would be abrogated at the expiration of the said term
                                of notice.</p>
                            <p>The forty-second parallel of latitude was also made the southern
                                boundary of the United States wet of the Rocky Mountains, by their
                                treaty with Mexico of April, 1831.</p>
                            <p>In a letter to Mr. Upshur, Secretary of State, of the 14th of
                                November, <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0365"/>1813, Mr.
                                Everett, United States minister to London, gives an account of an
                                interview which he had had with Lord Aberdeen on the 6th of that
                                month. His lordship considered that the question as to the
                                northwestern boundary stood as it had been left by Mr. Gallatin in
                                his negotiation with Messrs. Huskisson and Addington, in 1827. Lord
                                Aberdeen assented to a remark of Mr. Everett, that the numerous
                                stations which the Hudson’s Bay Company had established south of the
                                49th degree, since 1818, though they would embarrass the British
                                government in reference to that company, and, through them, in
                                reference to public opinion, ought not to prejudice the claims of
                                the United States. Mr. Everett also remarked that, in offering the
                                line of 49°, we acted fairly and liberally; that the offer was based
                                on the natural principles of distribution, while they, in refusing
                                that offer and insisting on the Columbia River, disregarded such
                                principles, and simply insisted upon a boundary very favorable to
                                themselves. The United States offer was in accordance with the rules
                                of the English charters, of running northern and southern boundaries
                                from sea to sea. To an objection of Lord Aberdeen, that lines of
                                latitude were arbitrary, Mr. Everett answered, that they were as
                                likely to be in favor of Great Britain as of the United States, and,
                                besides, could readily be-ascertained by men of science; that the
                                part of the boundary on the 49th parallel was the only one
                                respecting which no controversy had arisen or was to be feared.
                                Finally, Mr. Everett said, that an equal partition of the territory
                                was an obvious and natural principle of division, and that the
                                forty-ninth parallel was nearly an equal division of the region
                                between 42° and 54°.40. Mr. Everett said to Lord Aberdeen, that when
                                the United States presented themselves before the tribunal of the
                                public opinion of the world, with a statement of the nature and
                                foundation of their claim to the whole territory, as the successors
                                of Spain, and that they had offered to England a partition as nearly
                                equal as could be made, reserving to themselves only the half to
                                what they had a better independent claim than England, founded on
                                prior discovery, occupation, and exploration, and to which they had
                                the fair claim of contiguity and natural extension, there could not
                                be a doubt but that the decision of that tribunal would be in their
                                favor.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Everett went on to remark that the main difficulty in the
                                adoption of the forty-ninth degree to the ocean was, that it had
                                already been thrice offered to Great Britain and always rejected. To
                                meet this difficulty, suggested Mr. Everett, it might deserve the
                                President’s consideration whether he would not agree to give up the
                                southern extremity of Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, (which the
                                forty-ninth degree would leave within the United States,) on
                                condition that the entrance of the Straits of Juan de Fuca should at
                                all times be left open and free to the United States, with a free
                                navigation between that island and the mainland, and a free outlet
                                to the north.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch of the 2d of December, Mr. Everett gives an account of
                                another interview with Lord Aberdeen on the 29th of November, 1843,
                                in the course of which his lordship stated that it would be
                                impossible for the ministry, for the time being, to accept what had
                                been rejected in 1824 and 1826; that they did not suppose that we,
                                any more than themselves, could now agree to terms which we had then
                                declined; and that, consequently, there must be concession on both
                                sides; that they were willing to act on this principle, and that we
                                must do the same.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Everett says that he regarded that observation, now made to him
                                for the first time, as very important. He told Lord Aberdeen that he
                                thought it would be very difficult for the United States to make any
                                    <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0366"/>modification of their
                                former proposal, except in one point, which he regarded as very
                                important to England. He thought the President might be induced so
                                far to depart from the forty-ninth parallel as to leave the whole of
                                Quadra and Vancouver’s Island to England, whereas that line of
                                latitude would give the United States the southern extremity of that
                                island, and consequently the command of the straits of Fuca. Mr.
                                Everett said that he was not authorized to say whether that would be
                                agreed to, but that he thought and wished it might be. He then
                                pointed out on a map the extent of the concession, which Lord
                                Aberdeen said he would take into consideration.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch of the 1st of April, 1844, Mr. Everett gives an account
                                of another interview which he had with Lord Aberdeen on the 16th of
                                March, in the course of which he remarked that, in proportion as his
                                lordship should be inclined to think that the offer formerly made by
                                the United States to continue the forty-ninth to the sea was an
                                equitable offer, he ought to be satisfied with but a moderate
                                departure from that proposal, particularly if such modification,
                                without involving a great sacrifice to the United States, were
                                eminently advantageous to Great Britain. In fact, such a
                                modification was the only one which the United States, in Mr.
                                Everett’s opinion, could be brought to agree to. A waiver by the
                                United States of their claim to the southern extremity of Quadra and
                                Vancouver’s Island, which would be cut off by the forty-ninth degree
                                of latitude, was precisely of that kind. Lord Aberdeen did not
                                commit himself as to whether such a proposition would be
                                accepted.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Calhoun, of the 28th of February, 1845, Mr.
                                Everett, referring to the proceedings in Congress in regard to the
                                establishment of a territorial government in Oregon, stated that he
                                had had several conversations with Lord Aberdeen. Mr. Everett
                                expressed an opinion founded on them, that England would never
                                accept the naked proposition of the forty-ninth degree; but that she
                                would accept that line with the modification to which he had
                                referred in previous dispatches, namely: the southern extremity of
                                Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, though Lord Aberdeen had never told
                                him that they would do this, and he was confident that this was the
                                best boundary which the United States could get by negotiation.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, of the 3d of March, 1846, Mr. McLane
                                referred to interviews which he had had with Lord Aberdeen, and
                                stated that he had little or no expectation that the British
                                government would offer or assent to a better partition than the
                                extension of a line on the 49th parallel to the Straits of Fuca, and
                                thence through the middle of those straits to the Pacific.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, of the 18th of May, 1846, Mr. McLane
                                remarked: "I have now to acquaint you that, after the receipt of
                                your dispatches on the 15th instant, by the Caledonia, I had a
                                lengthened conference with Lord Aberdeen, on which occasion the
                                resumption of the negotiation for an amicable settlement of the
                                Oregon question, and the nature of the proposition he contemplated
                                submitting for that purpose, formed the subject of a full and free
                                conversation. I have now to state that instructions will be
                                transmitted to Mr. Pakenham by the steamer of to-morrow, to submit a
                                new and further proposition on the part of this government for a
                                partition of the territory in dispute.”</p>
                            <p>The proposition, most probably, will offer substantially: "First. To
                                divide the territory by the extension of the line on the parallel of
                                forty-nine to the sea; that is to say, to the arm of the sea called
                                Birch’s Bay; thence by the Canal de Arro and Straits of Fuca to the
                                ocean, and confirming to the United State’s what, indeed they would
                                possess <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0367"/>without any special
                                confirmation, the right freely to use and navigate the straits
                                throughout its extent."</p>
                            <p>June 29, 1846, in the House of Commons, Sir Robert Peel, in tendering
                                the resignation of the ministry, said, in reference to the
                                termination of the existing convention for the joint occupation of
                                Oregon by Great Britain and the United States: “It appeared to us
                                that the addition of that conciliatory declaration—the expression of
                                a hope that the termination of the convention might the more
                                strongly impress upon the two countries the necessity of amicable
                                adjustment—removed any barrier which diplomatic punctilios might
                                have raised to a renewal by this country of the attempt to settle
                                our differences with the United States. We did not hesitate,
                                therefore, within two days after the receipt of that intelligence—we
                                did not hesitate, although the offer of arbitration made by us had
                                been rejected—to do that which, in the present state of the
                                protracted dispute, it became essential to do, namely, not to
                                propose renewed and lengthened negotiations, but to specify frankly
                                and without reserve what were the terms on which we could consent to
                                a partition of the country of the Oregon. Sir, the President of the
                                United States met us in corresponding spirit. Whatever might have
                                been the expressions heretofore used by him, however strongly he
                                might have been personally committed to the adoption of a different
                                course, he most wisely and patriotically determined at once to refer
                                our proposals to the Senate, that authority of the United States
                                whose consent is requisite for the conclusion of any negotiation of
                                this kind, and the Senate, acting also in the same pacific spirit,
                                has, I have the heartfelt satisfaction to state, at once advised
                                acquiescence in the terms we offered. From the importance of the
                                subject, and considering that this is the last day I shall have to
                                address the house as a minister of the Crown, I may, perhaps, be
                                allowed to state what are the proposals we made to the United States
                                for the final settlement of the Oregon question. In order to prevent
                                the necessity for renewed diplomatic negotiations, we prepared and
                                sent out the form of a convention, which we trusted the United
                                States would accept."</p>
                            <p>Here Sir Robert Peel quoted the language of the first article of the
                                treaty, and, in explanation thereof, continued: “Those who remember
                                the local conformation of that country will understand that that
                                which we proposed is the continuation of the forty-ninth parallel of
                                latitude till it strikes the Straits of Fuca; that that parallel
                                should not be continued as a boundary across Vancouver’s Island,
                                thus depriving us of a part of Vancouver’s Island; but that the
                                middle of the channel shall be the future boundary, thus leaving us
                                in possession of the whole of Vancouver’s Island, with equal right
                                to navigation of the straits. Sir, the second article of the
                                convention we sent for the acceptance of the United States was to
                                this effect.”</p>
                            <p>Here Sir Robert Peel quoted the second article of the treaty,
                                relating to the navigation of the Columbia River.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, he said: “Sir, I will not occupy the attention of the
                                House with mere details. I have read the important articles.”</p>
                            <p>Sir Robert further quoted an official letter from Mr. Pakenham,
                                intimating the acceptance of the British proposals, and giving
                                assurance of the immediate termination of differences with the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Pakenham wrote, under date of June 13, that “the President sent a

                                votes to twelve, adopted yesterday evening a resolution advising the
                                President to accept the terms proposed by Her Majesty’s government.
                                President Buchanan accordingly sent for me this morning, and
                                informed me that the conditions offered by Her Majesty’s government
                                were accepted by the Government of the United States, without the
                                addition or alteration of a single word. Thus, sir, the governments
                                of two great nations, impelled, I believe, by the public opinion of
                                each country in favor of peace, have by moderation, by mutual
                                compromise, averted the dreadful calamity of a war between two
                                nations of kindred origin and common language.” (<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Mr. J. McHenry Boyd, chargé d’affaires of the United States at
                                London, in a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, Secretary of State, of the
                                19th of October, 1846, represents that British subjects contemplated
                                settling on Whitby’s Island, one of those within the Straits of
                                Fuca, south of the forty-ninth parallel; that the British government
                                had consequently been thrown into some doubt whether, according to
                                the boundary in the Oregon treaty, that island would fall within
                                American or British jurisdiction. Mr. Boyd accordingly suggested
                                that if the Department was not already in possession of evidence
                                clearly defining the line, measures should be taken toward obtaining
                                it, for the purpose of meeting the question when it should
                                arise.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan of the 3d of November, 1846, Mr.
                                Bancroft, then United States minister at London, requested a copy of
                                Wilkes’s chart of the Straits of Haro, it having been intimated to
                                him that questions might arise with regard to the islands east of
                                that strait. Mr. Bancroft requested authority to meet any such claim
                                at the threshold, by the assertion of the central channel of Straits
                                of Haro as the main channel intended by the recent treaty of
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Buchanan complied with Mr. Bancroft’s request by an instruction
                                of the 28th of December, 1846. The instruction remarks that it was
                                not probable that the British government would seriously claim any
                                island east of the Canal of Haro. That no doubt that was the channel
                                which Lord Aberdeen had in view when, in conversation with Mr.
                                McLane, about the middle of May, 1846, he explained the character of
                                the proposition he intended to submit through Mr. Pakenham, the
                                British minister at Washington. This was, first, to divide the
                                territory by the extension of the line on the parallel of 49° to the
                                sea; that is to say, to the arm of the sea called Birch’s Bay,
                                thence by the Canal de Haro and Straits of Fuca to the ocean.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan of the 29th of March, 1847, Mr.
                                Bancroft adverts to supposed wishes of the Hudson’s Bay Company to
                                get some of the islands on our side of the line in the Straits of
                                Fuca, and says that he would not be surprised if a formal
                                proposition should soon be made by the British government to run the
                                line. The proposition <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0369"/>would
                                in itself be proper if there should be no ulterior motive to raise
                                unnecessary doubts and to claim islands, that are properly ours. He
                                expressed his belief that the ministry had no such design. Some of
                                its members would be the first to frown on it.</p>
                            <p>In a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan, of the 4th of August, 1848, Mr.
                                Bancroft says that he had been told by Lord Palmerston that he had
                                made a proposition at Washington for marking the boundary and for
                                ascertaining the division line in the channel by noting the bearings
                                of certain objects. “I observed that the water in the channel of
                                Haro did not require to be divided, though, of course, the islands
                                east of the center channel of Haro were ours. He spoke of the
                                propriety of settling definitively the ownership of the several
                                islands, in order that settlements might not be begun by one party
                                on what properly belonged to the other.”</p>
                            <p>In a note to Mr. Buchanan, of the 13th of January, 1848, Mr. Crampton
                                stated that he had been instructed to propose that the two
                                governments should proceed to mark the boundary defined in the
                                treaty. After remarking upon other parts of the line, he goes on to
                                say: “But between the Gulf of Georgia and the Straits of Fuca the
                                line is less distinctly and accurately defined by the verbal
                                description of the treaty by which it is established, and local
                                circumstances render it probable that if this part of the line were
                                not to be precisely determined, the uncertainty as to its course
                                might give rise to disputes between British subjects and citizens of
                                the United States.” Mr. Crampton also said, in substance, that as
                                the point in the center of the channel between Vancouver's Island
                                and the continent could not, probably, be marked out by any object
                                to be permanently fixed on the spot, it should be ascertained by the
                                intersection of cross-bearings of natural and artificial
                                landmarks.</p>
                            <p>He goes on in the following words: “But in regard to this portion of
                                the boundary-line, a preliminary question arises, which turns upon
                                the interpretation of the treaty rather than upon the result of
                                local observation and survey. The convention of the 15th of June,
                                1846, declares that the line shall be drawn through the middle of
                                the <hi rend="italic">channel</hi> which separates the continent
                                from Vancouver’s Island. And upon this it may be asked what the word
                                ‘channel’ intended to mean. Generally speaking, the word ‘channel,’
                                when employed in treaties, means a deep and navigable channel. In
                                the present case it is believed that only one channel, that, namely,
                                which was laid down by Vancouver in his chart, has, in this part of
                                the Gulf, been hitherto surveyed and used, and it seems natural to
                                suppose that the negotiators of the Oregon convention, in employing
                                the word ‘ channel,’ had that particular channel in view.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Crampton’s note was accompanied by a draught of instructions to
                                the commissioners for marking the boundary.</p>
                            <p>The receipt of the communication, however, does not appear to have
                                been acknowledged.</p>
                            <p>With a note to Lord Palmerston of the 31st of July, 1848, Mr.
                                Bancroft sent a copy of Wilkes’s chart of the Straits of Juan de
                                Fuca; but remarked that, though it did not extend to the parallel of
                                49°, it contained the wide entrance into the Straits of Haro, the
                                channel through the middle of which the boundary was to be
                                continued.</p>
                            <p>With a dispatch to Mr. Buchanan of the 19th of October, 1848, Mr.
                                Bancroft sent a copy of the map of Vancouver’s Island, by Wyld,
                                geographer to the Queen. It purports to mark, by a dotted line, the
                                boundary between the United States and Great Britain. “You will see
                                that this map suggests an encroachment on our rights by adopting a
                                line far to the east of the Straits of Haro.”</p>

                            <p>With a note to Lord Palmerston of the 3d of November, 1848, Mr.
                                Bancroft sent him a copy of the United States surveys of the waters
                                of Puget Sound and those dividing Vancouver’s Island from our
                                territory. Mr. Bancroft remarked, “Your lordship will readily trace
                                the whole course of the Channel of Haro, through the middle of which
                                our boundary-line passes.”</p>
                            <p>In a note to Mr. Bancroft of the 7th of November Lord Palmerston
                                thanked him for the surveys.</p>
                            <p>An act of the Congress of the United States was passed on the 11th of
                                August, 1856, providing for the demarkation of the boundary on our
                                part. Mr. Archibald Campbell was appointed commissioner. The
                                instructions of Mr. Marcy, Secretary of State, addressed to him in
                                that character, bear date the 25th of February, 1857. They do not
                                advert to any particulars in regard to the water-boundary. The
                                following is a paragraph of the instructions: <quote

                            <p>Captain James C. Prevost, of Her Britannic Majesty’s ship Satellite,
                                was the commissioner on the part of Great Britain. After divers
                                conferences with Mr. Campbell on the subject of the water-boundary,
                                he addressed a letter to him under date the 28th of October, 1857,
                                setting forth his objections to the adoption of the line of the Haro
                                Channel. These are, in substance, that when the line from the
                                initial point in the Gulf of Georgia proceeds in a southerly
                                direction as far as 48° 45′ of north latitude, it meets a group of
                                islands through which there are two passages. One of these, called
                                Rosario Strait, is near the continent, and the other, called Haro
                                Channel, is nearer Vancouver’s Island. He asserts that the only
                                navigable channel separating the continent from Vancouver’s Island
                                is Rosario Strait.</p>
                            <p>He claims that the channel contemplated by the treaty should possess
                                three characteristics: 1st. It should separate the continent from
                                Vancouver’s Island; 2d. It should admit of the boundary-line being
                                carried through the middle of it in a southerly direction; 3d, It
                                should be a navigable channel. To these conditions the Rosario
                                Strait most entirely answers. He goes on to admit that the Haro
                                Channel is also navigable, but on account of the currents and the
                                want of anchorage-grounds, not so easily so. He asserts that that
                                channel does not separate the continent from Vancouver’s Island, and
                                that the line to reach that channel must proceed for some distance
                                in a westerly direction.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Campbell replied on the 2d of November, 1857, that as the Haro
                                Channel was pre-eminent in width, depth, and volume of water, this
                                must have been the one contemplated by the treaty. It was known
                                under its name since the first discovery, and was the only one
                                usually designated by name on the maps in use at the time the treaty
                                was under consideration, while the other channels only separate the
                                islands in the group from each other; the Haro Channel for a
                                considerable distance north of the Straits of Fuca, and where their
                                waters unite, washes the shore of Vancouver’s Island, and is
                                therefore the only one which, according to the language of the
                                treaty, separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island.</p>
                            <p>The term southerly used in the treaty would not admit of the
                                demarkation of the line in a due south direction through any
                                channel. It <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0371"/>was
                                consequently to be presumed that the genera<gap quantity="1"
                                    unit="characters"/> direction only was to be toward the
                                south.</p>
                            <p>Rosaria Straits do not separate the continent from Vancouver’s
                                Island, but some islands from others; although the relative merits
                                of the navigability for sailing-vessels of the Haro Channel and
                                Rosario Straits was not to be regarded as having any bearing on the
                                determination of the question. Captain Alden, however, of the United
                                States Navy, who, in the years 1853 and 1855, had made surveys of
                                those waters, had officially reported the Haro Channel as the
                                widest, deepest, and best. Reference is then made to the dispatch of
                                Mr. McLane to Mr. Buchanan of the 18th of May, 1846, in which he
                                reported that the line of the Haro Channel was to be proposed by the
                                British government. Mr. Campbell thence infers that the object of
                                the framers of the treaty was to run the line so as to avoid cutting
                                off the southern cape of Vancouver’s Island by adopting the line
                                through the Haro Channel. The speech of Mr. Benton in the Senate
                                relative to the treaty shows the same understanding in regard to
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Captain Prevost replied, under date of the 9th of November, that in
                                his opinion the Rosario Channel was the only one that conformed to
                                the language of the treaty, by separating the continent from
                                Vancouver’s Island. The Haro Channel separates Vancouver’s Island
                                from the continent. The usual terms of expression appear to be
                                designedly reversed in the treaty, for the lesser is not separated
                                from the greater, but the greater from the lesser. There is no
                                navigable channel between the continent and the islands on the east
                                of Rosario Straits, and, therefore, no such channel as the treaty
                                calls for. From the Gulf of Georgia to the Straits of Fuca the line
                                can be carried through Rosario Straits in a southerly, whereas
                                through the Haro Channel it must take a westerly direction.</p>
                            <p>The information given by Mr. McLane was as to a probable proposition.
                                The one adopted in the treaty was different.</p>
                            <p>He then refers to Preuss’s map of Oregon, printed by order of the
                                Senate, in which the line is carried through Rosario Channel.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Campbell rejoined, under date of the 18th November, 1857, that in
                                his judgment no change in the position of the words used in the
                                treaty could make any difference in their meaning. Captain Prevost’s
                                admission that the Haro Channel is undoubtedly the navigable channel
                                which, at its position, separates Vancouver’s Island from the
                                continent, might be regarded as tantamount to a settlement of the
                                question. Although Mr. McLane and Mr. Benton were not the signers of
                                the treaty, they had such an official connection with the
                                negotiations that their evidence should have equal weight with that
                                of the signers themselves. Immediately upon the receipt of Mr.
                                McLane’s dispatch of the 18th of May, Mr. Pakenham submitted to Mr.
                                Buchanan the draught of a convention. This draught was laid before
                                the Senate, with all the correspondence upon the subject, and was
                                approved by that body. The draught referred to is the same, word for
                                word, with the treaty as signed. Mr. Campbell shows that Captain
                                Prevost’s comment upon Mr. McLane’s dispatch, to the effect that
                                supposing the original proposition to have been as reported by that
                                gentleman it was designedly altered after discussion, to be without
                                foundation. No such discussion could have taken place between Mr.
                                McLane and Lord Aberdeen without being reported by the former; and
                                none could have taken place between Mr. Pakenham and Mr. Buchanan,
                                as the former was not authorized to enter into any. Preuss’s map had
                                no official authority.</p>
                            <p>Captain Prevost replied, under date of the 24th of November, 1858,
                                that <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0372"/>the continent as well
                                as the island must be regarded according to its natural
                                signification and according to its natural position; and that when
                                two channels exist between a continent and a particular island, the
                                argument appeared irresistible that the channel contiguous to the
                                continent was the channel separating the continent from the island,
                                while the channel contiguous to the island is the channel separating
                                the island from the continent. The inference that the Haro Channel
                                was proposed by the British government because that-happened to be
                                mentioned in Mr. McLane’s dispatch, was unwarrantable. He would be
                                surprised if Captain Alden should not agree with him that Rosario
                                Straits are preferable to Haro Channel for sailing-vessels. The
                                treaty in the matter of the channel separating the continent from
                                Vancouver’s Island was clear, and he could not admit any evidence on
                                this subject to weigh with him that would lead to an interpretation
                                that the precise terms of the treaty would not admit. Although he
                                was firm in the conviction that Rosario Straits and not Haro Channel
                                was the one contemplated by the treaty, he was willing to regard the
                                Gulf of Georgia as one channel, and agree to a line passing through
                                the middle of it, so far as the islands would permit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Campbell rejoined, under date of the 28th of November, 1858, that
                                the proposed instructions to the commissioners which accompanied Mr.
                                Crampton’s note to Mr. Buchanan, of the 13th of January, 1848,
                                contained the following sentence: “From that point you will carry on
                                the line of boundary along the forty-ninth parallel of latitude to
                                the middle of the channel between Vancouver’s Island and the
                                continent.”</p>
                            <p>This, Mr. Campbell contends, shows the view of the British government
                                within two years after the conclusion of the treaty. He adds that,
                                in 1848, Rosario Straits was not claimed on the ground that there
                                was anything peculiar in the wording of the treaty; nor was there
                                any claim founded upon the supposition of a “designed alteration” of
                                the original draught of the treaty by omitting the Haro Channel and
                                substituting its present language. In opposition to Captain
                                Prevost’s opinion that the words of the treaty were so peculiarly
                                precise and clear as to point out unmistakably Rosario Straits as
                                the channel, Mr. Crampton, speaking on the part of his government,
                                says: “But between the Gulf of Georgia and the Straits of Fuca the
                                line is less distinctly and accurately defined by the verbal
                                description of the treaty.” In regard to this, Mr. Campbell quotes
                                the following passage from Vattel: “If he who can and ought to have
                                explained himself clearly and plainly has not done it, it is the
                                worse for him. He cannot be allowed to introduce subsequent
                                restrictions which he has not expressed.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Campbell declined accepting Captain Provost’s proposition, and
                                expressed the opinion that there was not the slightest probability
                                that the British government, Captain Prevost, or any other person,
                                would ever be called upon for a renewal of it.</p>
                            <p>Captain Prevost replied, under date of the 1st of December, 1857,
                                that if the treaty was intended by the United States Government to
                                accord with the correspondence of Mr. McLane and the speech of Mr.
                                Benton, the general maxim which Mr. Campbell had quoted from Vattel
                                would be more applicable to the United States than to the British
                                government; for, if the former intended that the line should run
                                through the Haro Channel, they should have taken care that it was so
                                expressed “clearly and plainly “in the treaty. In conclusion, he
                                proposed a conference, in order that it might be formally recorded
                                that the commissioners were unable to agree; that Mr. Campbell had
                                declined to accede to his proposition for a compromise, and,
                                therefore, that the whole matter might be referred to their
                                respective governments.</p>
                            <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0373"/>
                            <p>Mr. Campbell replied on the 2d of December, recapitulating his
                                previous arguments, and concluding with the remark that he thought
                                any proposition, with a view to concession on the part of United
                                States, was hardly justifiable under the circumstances.</p>
                            <p>In a report to General Cass, Secretary of State, of the 25th of
                                September, 1858, Mr. Campbell represents that the settlement of the
                                question of the channel involves the sovereignty of the group of
                                islands called the Haro Archipelago, between the Haro Channel and
                                Rosario Straits, embraced in a space of about four hundred square
                                miles. He then proceeds to show the importance of these islands, in
                                a military and naval point of view, quoting official opinions of
                                officers.</p>
                            <p>In a letter to Mr. Campbell of the 15th of June, 1858, Mr. Bancroft
                                states that he was in Mr. Polk’s cabinet when the Oregon treaty was
                                concluded, and that the general understanding, both in England and
                                in the United States, was, that the British boundary was to extend
                                to the middle of the Haro Channel.</p>
                            <p>In a full and elaborate report to General Cass of the 20th of
                                January, 1859, Mr. Campbell reviewed his proceedings as
                                commissioner, and commented on the respective claims of the parties
                                to the channel mentioned in the treaty. In the course of his letter
                                Mr. Campbell expresses an opinion that the compromise line offered
                                by Captain Prevost would not be a suitable channel for a boundary,
                                with such channels as Haro and Rosario in its vicinity. In support
                                of this opinion, he states the maximum and minimum width of the
                                several channels, and refers to other important circumstances.</p>
                            <p>With a letter to the Department of the 21st of June, 1859, Mr.
                                Campbell transmitted a copy of the Coast Survey chart of the space
                                between the continent and Vancouver’s Island, corrected by the
                                results of a survey of the same space by Captain Richards, of the

                                December, 1856, and express the opinion that the Rosario Channel was
                                the boundary contemplated by the treaty. They use the following
                                language: “If, however, the commissioner of the United States will
                                not adopt the line along Rosario Straits, and if, on a detailed and
                                accurate survey, and on weighing the evidence on both sides of the
                                question, you should be of opinion that the claims of her Majesty’s
                                government to consider Rosario Straits as the channel indicated by
                                the words of the treaty cannot be substantiated, you would be at
                                liberty to adopt any other intermediate channel which you may
                                discover on which the United States commissioner and yourself may
                                agree, as substantially in accordance with the description of the
                                treaty.”</p>
                            <p>A copy of these instructions having been communicated to Mr.
                                Campbell, he remarks, in a letter to the Department of the 4th of
                                August, 1859, that they show that Captain Prevost was by them
                                virtually, if not positively, prohibited from adopting the Haro
                                Channel as the boundary channel intended by the treaty.</p>

                                Campbell communicated information of the landing of a company of
                                United States troops, under command of Captain Pickett, on the
                                island of San Juan, on the 26th of July. He also communicated a copy
                                of the protest of Governor Douglas, of Vancouver’s Island, against
                                the military occupation of that island by any other than a British
                                force.</p>

                                Island by a military force is not approved.</p>
                            <p>In a letter of Mr. Drinkard to General Scott, of the 16th of
                                September, 1859, the wish of the President was referred to that he
                                should take command of the military forces on the Pacific coast, and
                                he was instructed that until the title to the island of San Juan
                                could be adjusted it would be desirable for him to arrange for a
                                joint occupation of that island.</p>
                            <p>This General Scott did, in a letter of the 25th of October, 1859, to
                                Governor Douglas, of Vancouver’s Island. The proposition was at
                                first declined, but was afterward practically acceded to by the
                                landing of a body of British marines at the north end of the island.
                                The joint military occupation has ever since continued.</p>
                            <p>Under date the 12th of May, 1859, Lord Lyons addressed a note to
                                General Cass relative to attempts of citizens of the United States
                                to establish themselves on the island of San Juan, and stated that
                                his government trusted that the United States Government would, so
                                far as it could, restrain them from attempting to settle, by
                                unauthorized acts of violence, a question which there would probably
                                be little difficulty in arranging by amicable communication between
                                the two governments.</p>
                            <p>In an instruction to Lord Lyons of the 24th of August, 1859, Lord
                                Russell referred to the disagreement between the American and
                                British commissioners in regard to the demarkation of the water
                                boundary, expressed regret that no map was annexed to the treaty of
                                1846, but stated that his government fully concurred with their
                                commissioner that the line should run through Rosario Straits. He
                                then proceeded to review the arguments on both sides, and concluded
                                by proposing the same compromise line as that offered to Mr.
                                Campbell by Captain Prevost, and by declaring that his government
                                must, under any circumstances, maintain its right to the island of
                                San Juan.</p>
                            <p>This paper was fully replied to by General Cass in an instruction to
                                Mr. Dallas of the 20th of October, 1859. After adverting to
                                circumstances <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0375"/>leading to
                                the treaty of 1846, and stating that the object of the United States
                                in accepting that instrument was to allow to Great Britain the whole
                                of Vancouver’s Island, but to exclude her from any other territory
                                south of the parallel of 49°, the instruction goes on to remark that
                                the friendly sentiments expressed in Lord Russell’s paper do not
                                harmonize with the declaration which it contained that the British
                                government would, under any circumstances, maintain its right to the
                                island of San Juan. If this declaration should be insisted on, said
                                General Cass, it must terminate the negotiation at its threshold.
                                The proposition for compromise assumes that the disagreement in
                                respect to the treaty is irreconcilable. The failure of the
                                commissioners to agree was in part, at least, imputable to the
                                peculiar character of the instructions to the British commissioner.
                                At the time of the negotiation of the treaty, all that the British
                                government claimed was that the line should deflect from the
                                forty-ninth parallel so far as to assign to them the whole of
                                Vancouver’s Island. This was all that the American Government
                                conceded. Mr. Buchanan had instructed Mr. McLane that, except for
                                this, purpose, the President would never consent to bring the
                                British boundary a single inch below the parallel of 49°, and no
                                other purpose than this was anywhere’ avowed. The Haro is the only
                                channel which would not leave something more to Great Britain south
                                of the forty-ninth parallel than the southern cape of Vancouver’s
                                Island. Whether the Haro was or was not the true channel in the
                                opinion of the British negotiators, it was quite certain, from
                                current testimony of both the American and British negotiators, that
                                the Rosario Channel was not. The Douglas Channel, which was
                                suggested by Lord Russel, is admitted to be an inferior one,
                                scarcely capable of navigation, except by steamers, and was supposed
                                to be recommended because it would leave the island of San Juan to
                                Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>In an instruction to Lord Lyons, of the 16th of December, 1859, Lord
                                Russell replied that his government could not concur in the
                                conclusions to which General Cass had arrived. What Lord Aberdeen
                                meant by King George’s Sound, down which the line was to run, might
                                be clearly inferred from a letter addressed to him at the time of
                                the conclusion of the treaty, by Sir John Pelly, then the governor
                                of the Hudson’s Bay Company, of which letter the following is an
                                extract: “With respect to the other islands, the water demarkation
                                line should be from the center of the water in the Gulf of Georgia,
                                in the forty-ninth degree, along the line colored red as navigable
                                in the chart made by Vancouver until it reaches a line drawn through
                                the center of the Straits of Juan de Fuca. The only objection to
                                this is giving to the United States the valuable island of Whidbey.”
                                However the British government might be disposed to rely on the
                                instructions of Lord Aberdeen and the letter of Sir John Pelly, and
                                the United States on the statements of Mr. McLane and Mr. Benton, it
                                must be confessed on both sides that the interpretation of one
                                party, without the expressed assent of the other, goes but very
                                little way to remove the difficulty. Lord Russel concludes his paper
                                with a direction to renew the offer of compromise.</p>
                            <p>General Cass, in an instruction to Mr. Dallas, of the 4th of
                                February, 1860, after adverting to other points in the instruction
                                of Lord Russell to Lord Lyons of the 16th of December, 1859, states
                                that, as Lord Russell repeats his original declaration that no
                                settlement of the question would be accepted by the British
                                government which did not provide for the reservation of the island
                                of San Juan to the British Crown, the President had directed him to
                                state that the United States would, under all circumstances,
                                maintain their right to the island in controversy until <pb n="318"
                                    xml:id="pg_318" facs="0376"/>the question of title to it should
                                be determined by some amicable arrangement between the parties.</p>
                            <p>In an instruction to Lord Lyons of the 9th of March, 1860, Lord
                                Russell refers to his declaration contained in his dispatch of the
                                21th of August, to which exception was taken by General Cass, and
                                was put forward as a ground for declining to continue the
                                discussion. Lord Russell expresses disappointment that the
                                explanation which Lord Lyons was authorized to offer was not
                                accepted as satisfactory, “Her Majesty’s government maintain that
                                either the Canal de Rosario or the Douglas Channel might be held to
                                be the boundary contemplated by the treaty; but that the Canal de
                                Haro neither fulfills the intention of the British negotiators of
                                the treaty, nor is consistent with the words of the treaty
                                itself.”</p>
                            <p>In an instruction to Mr. Dallas of the 23d of April, 1860, General
                                Cass remarked that, as Lord Russell had acknowledged that the
                                expression objected to in his dispatch of the 24th of August, 1859,
                                was not intended to convey the meaning which this Government had
                                attached to it, the subject was now free from the embarrassment
                                occasioned thereby. General Cass also referred to the speech of Sir
                                Robert Peel on the treaty in the House of Commons on the 29th of
                                June, 1846, as showing that the deflection in the line from the
                                parallel of 49° had not left Great Britain in the possession of any
                                other island than that of Vancouver. “While the President,
                                therefore, feels himself obliged to decline to adopt the Douglas
                                Channel as the boundary of the two countries between Vancouver’s
                                Island and the continent, and to maintain the Canal de Haro as the
                                true boundary in that quarter, which was intended by the treaty, he
                                is glad to believe that no serious injury can be inflicted on
                                British interests by the adoption of the American line.”</p>

                                proposed that the question of the water boundary should be referred
                                to the arbitration of a reigning prince or sovereign state.</p>

                                        same shall have ceased, have further deemed it advisable to
                                        set on foot a blockade of the ports within the States
                                        aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United States and
                                        of the law of nations in such cases provided. For this
                                        purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent
                                        entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If,
                                        therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel
                                        shall approach, or shall attempt to leave either of the said
                                        ports, she will be duly warned by the commander of one of
                                        the blockading vessels, who will indorse on her register the
                                        fact and date of such warning, and if the same vessel shall
                                        again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port, she will
                                        be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port, for
                                        such proceedings against her and her cargo as prize as may
                                        be deemed advisable.</p>
                                    <p>And I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under
                                        the pretended authority of the said States, or under any
                                        other pretense, shall molest a vessel of the United States,
                                        or the persons or cargo on board of her, such persons will
                                        be held amenable to the laws of the United States for the
                                        prevention and punishment of piracy.</p>

                                    <p>An insurrection against the Government of the United States
                                        has broken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia,
                                        Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the
                                        law of the United States cannot be executed effectually
                                        therein conformably to that provision of the Constitution
                                        which requires duties to be uniform throughout the United
                                        States. And further, a combination of persons engaged in
                                        such insurrection have threatened to grant pretended letters
                                        of marque to authorize the bearers thereof to commit
                                        assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good
                                        citizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the
                                        high seas, and in the waters of the United States; and
                                        whereas an Executive proclamation has already been issued
                                        requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly
                                        proceedings to desist, and therefor calling out the militia
                                        force for the purpose of repressing the same, and convening
                                        Congress in extraordinary session to deliberate and
                                        determine thereon; the President, with a view to the same
                                        purposes before mentioned, and to the protection of the
                                        public peace, and the lives and property of its orderly
                                        citizens pursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress
                                        shall have assembled and deliberated on said unlawful
                                        proceedings, or until the same shall have ceased, has
                                        further deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the
                                        ports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws
                                        of the United States <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0379"

                                        purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent
                                        the entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid.
                                        If, therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, any
                                        vessel shall attempt to leave any of the said ports, she
                                        will be duly warned by the commander of one of said blocking
                                        vessels, who will indorse on her register the fact and date
                                        of such warning, and if the same vessel shall again attempt
                                        to enter or leave a blockade port, she will be captured and
                                        sent to the nearest convenient port, for such proceedings
                                        against her and her cargo as may be deemed advisable.</p>

                                        Ewart asked Lord Russell whether the government intended to
                                        place the British naval force in the Gulf of Mexico on
                                        sufficient footing, and if privateers sailing under flag of
                                        recognized power would be treated as pirates.</p>
                                    <p>Lord Russell replied that "Her Majesty’s government heard the
                                        other day that the Confederate States have issued letters of
                                        marque, and to-day we have heard that it is intended there
                                        shall be a blockade of all the ports of the Southern
                                        States;" and after stating that some of the questions had
                                        been submitted to the law-officers of the Crown, he said:
                                        “We have not been involved in any way in that contest, by
                                        any act or giving any advice in the matter, and, for God’s

                                        following question: “3d. The Government of the United States
                                        having refused to relinquish the belligerent right of
                                        issuing letters of marque, the seven Southern confederated
                                        and sovereign States having become to the United States a
                                        separate and independent and foreign power, whether Her
                                        Majesty’s government recognize the right of the president of
                                        the southern confederacy to issue letters of marque; and if
                                        so, whether our minister at Washington has been notified to
                                        that effect?” (<hi rend="italic">Vol. IV, p</hi>. 482.)</p>
                                    <p>Lord Russell, in reply, stated that, with respect to
                                        belligerent rights in the case of certain portions of a
                                        State being in insurrection, there was a precedent which
                                        seems applicable to this purpose in the year 1825. The
                                        British government at that time allowed the belligerent
                                        rights of the provisional government of Greece, and, in
                                        consequence of that allowanc, the Turkish government made a
                                        remonstrance. I may state the nature of that remonstrance
                                        and the reply of Mr. Canning. “The Turkish government
                                        complained that the British government allowed to the Greeks
                                        a belligerent character, and observed that it appeared to
                                        forget that to subjects in rebellion no national character
                                        could properly belong.” But the British government informed
                                        Mr. Stratford Canning <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322"
                                            facs="0380"/>that the “character of belligerency was not
                                        so much a principle as a fact; that a certain degree of
                                        force and consistency acquired by any mass of population
                                        engaged in war entitled that population to be treated as a
                                        belligerent, and even if their title were questionable,
                                        rendered it the interest, well understood, of all civilized
                                        nations so to treat them. For what was the alternative? A
                                        power or a community (call it which you will) which was at
                                        war with another, and which covered the sea with its
                                        cruisers, must either be acknowledged as a belligerent or
                                        dealt with as a pirate;” which latter character, as applied
                                        to the Greeks, was loudly disclaimed. In a separate dispatch
                                        of the same date, (12th of October, 1825,) Sir Stratford
                                        Canning was reminded that when the British government
                                        acknowledged the right of either belligerent to visit and
                                        detain British merchant-vessels having enemy’s property on
                                        board, and to confiscate such property, it was necessarily
                                        implied, as a condition of such acknowledgment, that the
                                        detention was for the purpose of bringing the vessels
                                        detained before an established court of prize, and that
                                        confiscation did not take place until after condemnation by
                                        such competent tribunal. The question has been under the
                                        consideration of the government. They have consulted the
                                        law-officers of the Crown. The attorney and
                                        solicitor-general and the Queen’s advocate, and the
                                        government have come to the opinion that the southern
                                        confederacy of America, according to those principles, which
                                        seem to them to be just principles, must be treated as a
                                        belligerent.” (<hi rend="italic">Vol. IV, p</hi>. 483.)</p>

                                        introduction. Viscount Palmers-ton, in reply, stated that
                                        “the house will bear in mind that my noble friend (Lord John
                                        Russell) stated last evening that this question of
                                        international rights, as connected with belligerent rights
                                        at sea, is of grave and complicated character; that it is
                                        under the consideration of the government, and until the
                                        government shall be in a condition, after consulting its
                                        legal advisers, to make some distinct communication upon the
                                        subject, it would be inexpedient, and indeed impossible, for
                                        them to enter into any discussion upon the matter.” (<hi

                                    <p>I understand that a proclamation is about to be issued by Her
                                        Majesty’s government on the subject of privateering and of
                                        belligerent rights. I hope that in that proclamation, or in
                                        some other way, a most distinct and emphatic warning will be
                                        given to all seamen in the service of Her Majesty as to the
                                        conditions upon which they will engage—if they choose to
                                        enter upon such hazardous enterprise—in the system of
                                        privateering. There should be no doubt left on their minds,
                                        but the fullest and plainest intimation should be publicly
                                        made to them, whether, if they do engage in such a service,
                                        they will or will not in extremity be entitled to expect any
                                        protection or interference on the part of this country. I
                                        hope my noble friend will state to your lordships whether
                                        the government have come to any conclusion upon this
                                        question; and if so, whether they are prepared forthwith to
                                        issue a public and emphatic notification of the course they
                                        intend to pursue, and the consequences likely to result to
                                        British seamen from a disregard of their warning.</p>
                                    <p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi>. The noble earl, by
                                        the manner in which he has approached the subject, has
                                        evinced a becoming appreciation of the difficulties which
                                        may arise to ourselves from the unfortunate state of things
                                        in the United State. With respect, however, to the question
                                        of the belligerent rights of the parties now engaged in that
                                        unhappy contest, the noble earl has not asked for any
                                        expression of opinion on the part of the government, and
                                        therefore I am absolved from entering into a discussion of
                                        that most important, difficult, and delicate subject. But
                                        the noble earl has inquired whether <pb n="323"
                                            xml:id="pg_323" facs="0381"/>it is our intention to
                                        issue a proclamation, warning the subjects of Her Majesty
                                        against in any manner departing from that neutrality which
                                        Her Majesty herself is so desirous to observe. To that
                                        question, as the noble earl has stated, an answer has
                                        already been given in “another place,” namely, that it is
                                        the intention of the government, according to precedent, to
                                        issue a proclamation, giving such warning to all the
                                        subjects of Her Majesty. The precise wording of the
                                        proclamation is a matter of considerable importance and
                                        difficulty requiring some deliberation, and we have thought
                                        it right to obtain the best advice in framing it; but I may
                                        state that the government are anxious to make it as plain
                                        and emphatic as possible. (<hi rend="italic">Vol. IV,

                                    <p>I must be permitted to express the great regret I had felt on
                                        learning the decision to issue the Queen’s proclamation,
                                        which at once raised the insurgents to the level of a
                                        belligerent state, and still more the language used in
                                        regard to it by Her Majesty’s ministers in both houses of
                                        Parliament before and since. Whatever might be the design,
                                        there could be no shadow of doubt that the effect of these
                                        events had been to encourage the friends of the disaffected
                                        here. The tone of the press and of private opinion indicated
                                        it strongly. I then alluded more especially to the brief
                                        report of the lord chancellor’s speech on Thursday last, in
                                        which he had characterized the rebellious portion of my
                                        country as a belligerent state, and the war that was going
                                        on as <hi rend="italic">justum bellum.</hi></p>
                                    <p>To this his lordship replied that he thought more stress was
                                        laid upon these events, than they deserved. The fact was
                                        that a necessity seemed to exist to define the course of the
                                        government in regard to the participation of the subjects of
                                        Great Britain in the impending conflict. To that end, the
                                        legal questions involved had been referred to those officers
                                        most conversant with them, and their advice had been taken
                                        in shaping the result. Their conclusion had been that, as a
                                        question merely of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, a war
                                        existed. A considerable number of the States, at least
                                        seven, occupying a wide extent of country, were in open
                                        resistance, while one or more of the others” were
                                        associating themselves in the same struggle, and as yet
                                        there were no indications of any other result than a contest
                                        of arms more or less severe. In many preceding cases much
                                        less formidable demonstrations had been recognized. Under
                                        such circumstances it seemed scarcely possible to avoid
                                        speaking of this in the technical sense as <hi rend="italic"
                                            >justum bellum</hi>, that is, a war of two sides,
                                        without in any way applying an opinion of its justice, as,
                                        well as to withhold an endeavor, so far as possible, to
                                        bring the management of it within the rules of modern
                                        civilized warfare. This was all that was contemplated by the
                                        Queen’s proclamation, it was designed to show the purport of
                                        existing laws, and to explain to British subjects their
                                        liabilities in case they should engage in the war. And
                                        however strongly the people of the United States might feel
                                        against their enemies, it was hardly to be supposed that in
                                        practice they would now vary from their uniformly humane
                                        policy heretofore in endeavoring to assuage and mitigate the
                                        horrors of war.</p>
                                    <p>To all which I answered that under other circumstances I
                                        should be very ready to give my cheerful assent to this view
                                        of his lords-hip’s; but I must be permitted frankly to
                                        remark that the action taken seemed, at least to my mind, a

                                        occasion. It might be recollected that the new
                                        administration had scarcely had sixty days to develop its
                                        policy; that the extent to which <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324"

                                        understood here, at least in part; that the very
                                        organization upon which any future action was to be
                                        predicated was to be renovated and purified before a hope
                                        could be entertained of energetic and effective labor. The
                                        consequence had been that it was but just emerging from its
                                        difficulties, and beginning to develop the power of the
                                        country to cope with this rebellion, when the British
                                        government took the initiative, and decided practically that
                                        it is a struggle of two sides; and, furthermore, it
                                        pronounced the insurgents to be a belligerent state before
                                        they had ever shown their capacity to maintain any kind of
                                        warfare whatever, except within one of their own harbors and
                                        under every possible advantage. It considered them a marine
                                        power before they had ever exhibited a single privateer on
                                        the ocean. I said that I was not aware that a single armed
                                        vessel had yet been issued from any port under the control
                                        of these people. (Vol. I, p. 183.)</p>

                                        approbation. At the same time it is the purpose of this
                                        Government, if possible, consistently with the national
                                        welfare and honor, to have no serious controversy with Great
                                        Britain at all; and if this shall ultimately prove
                                        impossible, then to have both the defensive position and the
                                        clear right on our side. With this view, this Government, as
                                        you are made aware by my dispatch No. 10, has determined to
                                        pass over without official complaint the publications of the
                                        British press, manifestations of adverse individual opinion
                                        in social life, and the speeches of British statesmen, and
                                        even those of Her Majesty’s ministers in Parliament, so long
                                        as they are not authoritatively adopted by Her Majesty’s
                                        government. We honor and respect the freedom of debate and
                                        the freedom of the press. We indulge no apprehensions of

                                        Sure as we are that the transaction now going on in our

                                        and equally sure that our attitude in it is right, and no

                                Secretary of State, dated Borne, April 20, 1870, directs attention
                                to some of the more important parts of the correspondence contained
                                in the volumes entitled “Claims against Great Britain,” and to some
                                important correspondence not contained in that compilation. This
                                letter was written after the receipt of the second volume, which
                                fact explains some apparent mistakes of the writer: <quote

                                        printed. The Secretary may be aware that I gave a winter’s

                                        annotations in the manuscript volumes of the archives, to
                                        facilitate future reference to documents and parts of

                                        recognition of confederate independence than had been done
                                        on the 6th of May. It is for this reason that I have already
                                        ventured in my former letter to press upon the Secretary’s
                                        attention the importance of these papers, and my earnest
                                        hope, if no scruple of delicacy toward Mr. Trescot exists on
                                        the part of the Government, and no fear of their exciting
                                        national hostilities, that they may be given to the world. I
                                        would add, in respect to these papers, that Mr. Trescot
                                        accompanied them with Southern newspaper-cuttings, showing
                                        the republication in those journals, in the summer of 1862,
                                        of the British parliamentary documents of May 6, 1861,
                                        &amp;c., which cuttings I hope will make a part of the
                                        compilation publication, if such publication of them is ever
                                        to be made; and that Mr. Trescot speaks, in his record
                                        memorandum of the mission, of a long “<hi rend="italic"
                                            >private</hi>” letter of Lord Lyons to Bunch, which, if
                                        procurable, would probably be worth more than all the other
                                        documents put together. I am not certain, however, that Mr.
                                        Trescot did not orally inform Mr. Sanford, through whose
                                        patriotic exertions these valuable documents were secured to
                                        the United States Government, that he had returned this

                                        it may perhaps be worth mentioning to the honorable
                                        Secretary, that Mr. Seward thought his lordship’s quotation
                                        of Canning’s dispatch of the 12th of October, 1825, (toward
                                        the close of the speech)—that in which he speaks of its
                                        being a condition-precedent to any such belligerent
                                        recognition, “that the detention by the searching vessel is
                                        for the purpose of bringing the vessels detained before an

                                        to v, underneath the general title “<hi rend="italic"
                                            >Recognition of Rebel Belligerency;</hi> why the general
                                        title itself is not resumed again on page iv; how the “<hi

                                        with the main subject; the same of the “<hi rend="italic"
                                            >Revocation of Bunch’s Exequatur</hi>;” what is meant by

                                        xxxiii-xxxvii; and how “<hi rend="italic">Propositions for

                                        from the current general title “<hi rend="italic"
                                            >Recognition of Rebel Belligerency</hi>.” Nor do I
                                        understand exactly why, in the text and body of the volume
                                        from page 517 to the end, the main title of the volume and
                                        the heading of the page “<hi rend="italic">Claims against
                                            Great Britain</hi>" is dropped, and “<hi rend="italic"
                                            >Enforcement of Neutrality</hi>” is made to occupy the
                                        heading of the left-hand page, with “<hi rend="italic"
                                            >Amendment of Laws”</hi> &amp;c., on the right-hand
                                        side. The Compilation for most purposes would be far more
                                        satisfactory, I am “constrained to think, without any
                                        divisions at all, and with a mere chronological
                                        juxtaposition of documentary pieces, than with such a
                                        confusing and misguiding series of captions and titles. In
                                        saying, this I am well aware that some of these divisions
                                        were of my own suggestion; but with the mechanical
                                        arrangement, or rather <hi rend="italic"
                                        >mis</hi>-arrangement, of printing, and still more in the
                                        absence of an explanatory preface, I find that all such
                                        arrangement and distribution of my own has only led to
                                        complicated disorder.</p>
                                    <p>But to hasten on with my imperfect catalogue of omissions and
                                        misarrangements under the head of “Recognition of Rebel
                                        Belligerency,” to which I have devoted a more especial
                                        attention, I find one of the five or six <hi rend="italic"

                                        in the Compilation, (vol. 1, pp. 279, &amp;c.,) but neither
                                        Mr. Seward’s instruction nor Mr. Adams’s communication of
                                        the instruction which led to the refusal. A portion is of
                                        Mr. Seward’s letter,<note n="§" xml:id="d29fn13">Given in

                                        the instruction is contained, is indeed given at page 676
                                        under “<hi rend="italic">Amendment of laws</hi>,” but not
                                        the extract on pagers 41, 42, (of United States Dip. Cor.,)
                                        relating to belligerent recognition, which seems to have
                                        been overlooked by the compiler. It is true that both
                                        Messrs. Seward’s and Adams’s entire dispatches’ of October
                                        24 and November 23 are given in vol. 2, of the Compilation,
                                        under “<hi rend="italic">Rebel operations from Canada</hi>,”
                                        (pp. 20–36,) but the two portions of the <hi rend="italic"
                                            >Belligerent-Recognition</hi> correspondence ought not
                                        obviously to be given thus dislocated and dissevered.
                                        Especially, as it seems to me, was it desirable to bring our
                                        demand into juxtaposition with Lord Russell’s <hi

                                        the rebel secretary of state, (elsewhere commented on,)
                                        justly characterized as a gratuitous and extraordinary
                                        offensive insult to the Government of the United States.</p>
                                    <p>I find that I have omitted to notice in their chronological
                                        order two other important dispatches, or extracts of
                                        dispatches, of the year’1862, relating to the same head of
                                        Rebel Belligerency, which ought to have been repeated, or
                                        else differently arranged, in vol. 1 of the Compilation. The
                                        first is <hi rend="italic">Seward to Adams, No</hi>. 260,

                                        dispatch in which Mr. Seward invoked the element of slavery
                                        for the first time, as a ground for revocation of
                                        belligerency, and which dispatch both Messrs. Seward and
                                        Adams regarded as of the highest importance; and the second,

                                    <p>But to recur to the latter period of 1865; again I find the
                                        important dispatch of <hi rend="italic">Seward to

                                        245,) omitted from both vols. 1 and 2, This is a dispatch in
                                        which Mr. Seward makes the diminution and destruction of
                                        American commerce a specific ground of <hi rend="italic"
                                            >national</hi> claim against Great Britain, connected
                                        with the outfit in British ports of rebel cruisers, and
                                        which assumes more consequence by reason of Mr. Reverdy
                                        Johnson’s recent unfounded admissions in that respect. I
                                        ought to notice, perhaps, in reference to the compilation,
                                        that Mr. Adams’s fulfillment of Mr. Seward’s instruction, by
                                        way of communicating this dispatch, is given at page 290 of
                                        vol. 1 of the Compilation, though somewhat varied in terms
                                        and recast as to its connection. Another dispatch of <hi

                                    <p>Some or all of these are certainly necessary to tell the
                                        story of the reluctant recall by England of rebel
                                        recognition, and how easily and fairly the same measures (of
                                        merely withholding hospitality from rebel cruisers, and of
                                        according it as usual to United States ships of war) might
                                        have been practiced upon by that government from 1862
                                        downward.</p>

                            <p>This branch of the case may be appropriately closed by printing
                                entire the instructions of Mr. Fish to Mr. Motley, of the 25th of
                                September, 1869, and the unsigned “notes" upon that dispatch, which
                                were handed to Mr. Fish by Mr. Thornton on the 6th day of November,

                            <p>Although an official character to the latter document was disavowed
                                by Lord Clarendon, and it, therefore, does not form a part of the
                                official record of the case, the fact that it was reputed to have
                                been prepared by Lord Tenderden (then Mr. Abbott) will give it an
                                interest in the eyes of the American commissioners.</p>

                                the moment was thought not to be the most hopeful to enter upon
                                renewed discussion or negotiation with the government of Great
                                Britain on the subject of the claims of this Government against that
                                of Her Majesty, and you were instructed to convey to Lord Clarendon
                                the opinion of the President that a suspension of the discussion for
                                a short period might allow the subsidence of any excitement or
                                irritation growing out of events then recent, and might enable the
                                two governments to approach more readily to a solution of their
                                differences.</p>
                            <p>You have informed me that Lord Clarendon saw no objection to this
                                course, and agreed with you that it would be well to give time for
                                emotions which had been excited of late to subside. The President is
                                inclined to believe that sufficient time may have now elapsed to
                                allow subsidence of those emotions, and that thus it may be <pb
                                    n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0388"/>opportune and convenient at
                                the present conjuncture to place in your hands, for appropriate use,
                                a dispassionate exposition of the just causes of complaint of the
                                Government of the United States against that of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>In order to do this in a satisfactory manner, it is necessary to go
                                back to the very beginning of the acts and events which have in
                                their progress and consummation so much disturbed the otherwise
                                amicable relations of the two governments.</p>
                            <p>When, in the winter of 1860 and 1861, certain States of the American
                                Union undertook by ordinances of secession to separate themselves
                                from the others, and to constitute of their own volition, and by
                                force, a new and independent republic, under the name of the
                                Confederates States of America, there existed as between Great
                                Britain and the United States a condition of profound peace; their
                                political relations were professedly and apparently of the most
                                friendly character, and their commercial and financial relations
                                were as close and intimate in fact as they seemed to be cordial in
                                spirit, such as became the two great, liberal, progressive, and
                                maritime and commercial powers of the world, associated as they were
                                by strong ties of common interest, language, and tradition.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States had no reason to presume that the
                                amicable sentiments of the British government would be diminished,
                                or otherwise prejudicially affected, by the occurrence of domestic
                                insurrection within the United States, any more than those of the
                                latter had been impaired by the occurrence of insurrection in
                                British India, or might be impaired by such occurrence elsewhere in
                                the dominions of Great Britain. Least of all could the Government of
                                the United States anticipate hostility toward it, and special
                                friendship for the insurgents of the seceding States, in view of the
                                inducements and objects of that insurrection, which avowedly, and as
                                every statesman, whether in Europe or America, well knew, and as the
                                very earliest mention of the insurrection in the House of Commons
                                indicated, were the secure establishment of a perpetual and
                                exclusive slave-holding republic. In such a contest the Government
                                of the United States was entitled to expect the earnest good-will,
                                sympathy, and moral support of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>It was with painful astonishment, therefore, that the United States
                                Government received information of the decision of Her Majesty’s
                                government, which had already been made on the 6th day of May, 1861,
                                and was announced on that day, in the House of Commons, by her
                                ministers, and was followed by the issue, on the 13th of May, 1861,
                                of a proclamation, which in effect recognized the insurgents as a
                                belligerent power, and raised them to the same level of neutral
                                right with the United States.</p>
                            <p>The President does not deny, on the contrary he maintains, that every
                                sovereign power decides for itself, on its responsibility, the
                                question whether or not it will, at a given time, accord the status
                                of belligerency to the insurgent subjects of another power, as also
                                the larger question of the independence of such subjects, and their
                                accession to the family of sovereign states.</p>
                            <p>But the rightfulness of such an act depends on the occasion and the
                                circumstances., and it is an act, like the sovereign act of war,
                                which the morality of the public law, and practice requires should
                                be deliberate, seasonable, and just in reference to surrounding
                                facts; national belligerency, indeed, like national independence,
                                being but an existing fact, officially recognized as such; without
                                which such a declaration is only the indirect manifestation of a
                                particular line of policy.</p>
                            <p>The precipitancy of the declaration of the Queen’s government, or, as
                                Mr. Bright characterized it, “the remarkable celerity, undue and
                                unfriendly haste” with which it was made, appears in its having been
                                determined on the 6th of May, four days prior to the arrival in
                                London of any official knowledge of the President’s proclamation,
                                (of April 19, 1861,) by reference to which the Queen’s proclamation
                                has since been defended, and that it was actually signed on the 13th
                                of May, the very day of the arrival of Mr. Adams, the new American
                                minister, as if in the particular aim of forestalling and preventing
                                explanations on the part of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The prematureness of the measure is further shown by the very tenor
                                of the proclamation, which sets forth its own reasons, namely,
                                “Whereas hostilities have unhappily commenced between the Government
                                of the United States of America and certain States styling
                                themselves the Confederate States of America.” Moreover it is not
                                pretended by the proclamation that war exists, but only a “contest,”
                                in reference to which it is not unimportant to note that the
                                language used is such as would fitly apply to parties wholly
                                independent one of the other, so as thus to negative, or to
                                suppress, at least, the critical circumstance, that this bare
                                commencement of hostilities, this incipient contest, was a mere
                                domestic act of insurrection within the United States.</p>
                            <p>But that which conclusively shows the unseasonable precipitancy of
                                the measure is the fact that on that day, May 13, 1861, and indeed
                                until long afterward, not a battle had been fought between the
                                insurgents and the United States, nor a combat even, save the
                                solitary and isolated attack on Fort Sumter. Did such a bare
                                commencement of hostilities constitute belligerency? Plainly
                                not.</p>
                            <p>There was at that time no such thing as a population elevated into
                                force, and by the prosecution of war, which Mr. Canning points out
                                as the test of belligerent condition. <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331"
                                    facs="0389"/>The assumed belligerency of the insurgents was a
                                fiction, a war on paper only, not in the field, like a paper
                                blockade; the. anticipation of supposed belligerency to come, but
                                which might never have come if not thus anticipated and encouraged
                                by the Queen’s government.</p>
                            <p>Indeed, as forcibly put by Mr. Adams, the Queen’s declaration had the
                                effect of creating posterior belligerency, instead of merely
                                acknowledging an actual fact; and that belligerency, so far as it
                                was maritime, proceeding from the ports of Great Britain and her
                                dependencies alone, with aid and co-operation of subjects of Great
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States, that of Great Britain, and other
                                European powers, had repeatedly had occasion to consider this
                                question in all its bearings.</p>
                            <p>It was perceived that the recognition of belligerency on the part of
                                    <hi rend="italic">insurgents</hi>, although not so serious an
                                act as the recognition of independence, yet might well be
                                prejudicial to the legitimate government, and therefore be regarded
                                by it as an act of unfriendliness. It was a step, therefore, to be
                                taken with thoughtfulness, and with due regard to exigent
                                circumstances. Governments had waited months, sometimes years, in
                                the face of actual hostilities, without taking this step. But
                                circumstances might arise to call for it. A ship of the insurgents
                                might appear in the port of the neutral, or a collision might occur
                                at sea, imposing on the neutral the necessity to act; or actual
                                hostilities might have continued to rage in the theater of insurgent
                                war, combat after combat might have been fought for such a period of
                                time, a mass of men may have engaged in actual war until they should
                                have acquired the consistency of military power, to repeat the idea
                                of Mr. Canning, so as evidently to constitute the fact of
                                belligerency, and to justify the recognition by the neutral; or the
                                nearness of the seat of hostilities to the neutral may compel the
                                latter to act. In either of these contingencies the neutral would
                                have a right to act; it might be his sovereign duty to act, however
                                inconvenient such action should be to the legitimate government.
                                There” was no such fact of necessity, no such fact of continued and
                                flagrant existing hostilities, to justify the action of Great
                                Britain in the present case. Hence the United States felt
                                constrained at the time to regard this proclamation as the sign of a
                                purpose of unfriendliness to them, and of friendliness to the
                                insurgents, which purpose could not fail to aggravate all the evils
                                of the pending contest, to strengthen the insurgents, and to
                                embarrass the legitimate government. And so it proved, for as time
                                went on, as the insurrection from political came at length to be
                                military, as the sectional controversy in the United States
                                proceeded to exhibit itself in the organization of great armies and
                                fleets, and in the prosecution of hostilities on a scale of gigantic
                                magnitude, then it was that the spirit of the Queen’s proclamation
                                showed itself in the event; seeing that in virtue of the
                                proclamation maritime enterprises in the ports of Great Britain,
                                which would otherwise have been piratical, were rendered lawful, and
                                thus Great Britain became, and to the end continued to be, the
                                arsenal, the navy-yard, and the treasury of the insurgent
                                confederacy.</p>
                            <p>A spectacle was thus presented without precedent or parallel in the
                                history of civilized nations. Great Britain, although the professed
                                friend of the United States, yet, in time of avowed international
                                peace, permitted armed cruisers to be fitted out and harbored and
                                equipped in her ports, to cruise against the merchant-ships of the
                                United States and to burn and destroy them, until our maritime
                                commerce was swept from the ocean. Our merchant-vessels were
                                destroyed piratically by captors who had no ports of their own in
                                which to refit or to condemn prizes, and whose only nationality was
                                the quarter-deck of their ships, built, dispatched to sea, and not
                                seldom in name, still, professedly owned in Great Gritain. Earl
                                Russell truly said, “It so happens that in this conflict the
                                confederates have no ports, except those of the Mersey and the
                                Clyde, from which they send out ships to cruise against the
                                Federals.” The number of our ships thus directly destroyed amounts
                                to nearly two hundred, and the value of property destroyed to many
                                millions. Indirectly the effect was to increase the rate of
                                insurance in the United States, to diminish exports and imports, and
                                otherwise obstruct domestic industry and production, and to take
                                away from the United States its immense foreign commerce, and to
                                transfer this to the merchant-vessels of Great Britain, so that
                                while in the year 1860 the foreign merchant tonnage of the United
                                States amounted to 2,546,237 tons, in 1866 it had sunk to 1,492,923
                                tons. This depreciation is represented by a corresponding increase
                                in the tonnage of Great Britain during the same period, to the
                                amount of 1,120,650 tons. And the amount of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >commerce</hi> abstracted from the United States and transferred
                                to Great Britain during the same period is in still greater
                                proportion. Thus, in effect, <hi rend="italic">war against the
                                    United States</hi> was carried on from the ports of Great
                                Britain by British subjects in the name of ‘the confederates. Mr.
                                Cobden, in the House of Commons, characterized by these very words
                                the acts permitted or suffered by the British government: “You have
                                been carrying on war from these shores against the United States,”
                                he said, “and have been inflicting an amount of damage on that
                                country greater than would have been produced by many ordinary
                                wars.”</p>
                            <p>The gravity of these facts may be appreciated by considering what had
                                happened at other periods. In the latter period of the war of the
                                French revolution, Great Britain <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                                    facs="0390"/>was compelled to strain every nerve to maintain
                                “herself against the power of Napoleon. In such straits, by a sort
                                of war in disguise, she, trespassed on the rights of neutrals, with
                                special prejudice to the United States, to the result, at length, of
                                solemn war between the two nations. But neither in the events which
                                preceded that war, nor in the events of the war itself, did the
                                United States suffer more at the hands of Great Britain than we did
                                during the late rebellion, by the aid, direct or indirect, which she
                                afforded to the confederated insurgent States; for while on the
                                ocean our merchant marine was destroyed by cruisers sent, out from
                                Great Britain, and our military marine was mainly occupied in
                                watching and counter-working blockade-runners fitted out in Great
                                Britain by official agents of the insurgents, on the land it was in
                                like manner the munitions of war and the wealth drawn by the
                                insurgents from Great Britain which enabled them to withstand, year
                                after year, the arms of the United States. In the midst of all this,
                                remonstrances of the Government of the United States were prompt,
                                earnest, and persistent. Our minister in London appealed to the
                                international amity of the British government; he called on it to
                                discharge its obligations of neutrality; he invoked the aid of the
                                municipal laws of Great Britain. Ample proofs of the wrongs
                                committed were submitted to the Queen’s government. Indeed, these
                                wrongs were open, notorious—perpetrated in the face of day—the
                                subject of debate and of boast, even, in the House of Commons.</p>
                            <p>The Queen’s ministers excused themselves by alleged defects in the
                                municipal law of the country. Learned counsel either advised that
                                the wrongs committed did not constitute violations of the municipal
                                law, or else gave sanction to artful devices of deceit, to cover up
                                such violations of law. And, strange to say, the courts of England
                                or of Scotland, up to the very highest, were occupied month after
                                month with judicial niceties and technicalities of statute
                                construction, in this respect, while the Queen’s government itself,
                                including the omnipotent Parliament, which might have settled these
                                questions in an hour by appropriate legislation, sat with folded
                                arms, as if unmindful of its international obligations, and suffered
                                ship after ship to be constructed in its ports to wage war on the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>We hold that the international duty of the Queen’s government in this
                                respect was above and independent of the municipal laws of England.
                                It was a sovereign duty attaching to Great Britain as a sovereign
                                power. The municipal law was but a means of repressing or punishing
                                individual wrong-doers. The law of nations was the true and proper
                                rule of duty for the government. If the municipal laws were
                                defective, that was a domestic inconvenience, of concern only to the
                                local government, and for it to remedy or not by suitable
                                legislation, as it pleased. But no sovereign power can rightfully
                                plead the defects of its own domestic penal statutes as
                                justification or extenuation of an international wrong to another
                                sovereign power. When the defects of the existing laws of Parliament
                                had become apparent, the Government of the United States earnestly
                                entreated the Queen’s minister to provide the required remedy, as it
                                would have been easy to do by a proper act of Parliament; but this
                                the Queen's government refused.</p>
                            <p>The United States, at an early day in their history, had set the
                                example of repressing violations of neutrality to the prejudice of
                                Great Britain by their own authority, and in the discharge of their
                                own national duty, without waiting for the assistance of municipal
                                statute. They afterward enacted such statutes for their own
                                convenience, and as attestation of their good faith toward other
                                nations. And on special occasions, when defects were perceived in
                                such laws, we enacted new ones to meet the case, not; deeming that
                                such legislation was derogatory to our public dignity; but, on the
                                contrary, conceiving that in so doing we best consulted the highest
                                dictates of national dignity, self-respect, and public honor. And if
                                Great Britain had so understood her national duty on this occasion,
                                she would have done much to save the two countries from the present
                                controversy and all its possible consequences.</p>
                            <p>Once before, in its intercourse with the United States, the Queen’s
                                government had fallen into the error of assuming that municipal laws
                                constitute the measure of international rights and obligations; that
                                is to say, when official agents of the British government attempted
                                to enlist military recruits in the neutral countries of Prussia, the
                                United States, and elsewhere, for service against Russia, on the
                                hypothesis that, if the prohibitions of municipal law could be
                                evaded, that would suffice, overlooking the paramount consideration
                                of the respect due to the sovereign rights of the neutral power.</p>
                            <p>So, on the present occasion, the Queen’s ministers seem to have
                                committed the error of assuming that they needed not to look beyond
                                their own local law, enacted for their own domestic convenience, and
                                might, under cover of the deficiencies of that law, disregard their
                                sovereign duties toward another sovereign power. Nor was it, in our
                                judgment, any adequate excuse for the Queen’s ministers to profess
                                extreme tenderness of private rights, or apprehension of actions for
                                damages, in case of any attempt to arrest the many ships which,
                                either in England or Scotland, were with ostentatious publicity
                                being constructed to cruise against the United States.</p>
                            <p>Surely, that was an imaginary difficulty; or if a real one, it
                                presented the election <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0391"
                                />between a serious complication of relations with the United States
                                and the hazard of a legal conflict with John Laird and Charles Kuhn
                                Prioleau.</p>
                            <p>But the Government of the United States has never been able to see
                                the force of this alleged difficulty. The common law of England is
                                the common law of the United States. In both countries, and
                                certainly in England, revenue seizures are made daily, and ships
                                prevented from going to sea on much Jess cause of suspicion than
                                attached to the suspected ships of the confederates.</p>
                            <p>In both countries, and not least in England, the previous order of
                                the government, or its subsequent approval, covers the acts of the
                                subordinate officers. In both countries, or if not in England
                                assuredly in the United States, under municipal laws in this behalf
                                substantially the same, the Government finds no difficulty in
                                arresting ships charged with actual or intended violation of the
                                sovereign rights or neutral duties of the States.</p>
                            <p>Signal examples of this occur in the history of the United Stages.
                                Thus, during the late war between Great Britain and Russia, on
                                complaints with affidavits being filed by the British consul at New
                                York, charging that the bark Maury was being equipped there as a
                                belligerent cruiser, and this on far less evidence than that which
                                the American consul at Liverpool exhibited against the Alabama, the
                                bark Maury was arrested within an hour by telegraphic order from
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>Other examples of the same decision and promptitude, in maintenance
                                of the sovereign rights and discharge of the neutral duties of the
                                United States, have occurred, as is well known, under both the last
                                and present administrations.</p>
                            <p>Nay, at every period of our history, the Government of the United
                                States has not, been “content, with preventing the-departure of
                                ships fitted out in violation of neutrality, and of putting a stop
                                to military recruitments and expeditions of the same nature, but has
                                further manifested its good faith and its respect for its own
                                sovereignty and laws by prosecuting criminally the guilty parties.
                                Examples of this occur in the early stages of the war of the French
                                revolution, on occasions of the insurrection of the Spanish-American
                                continental provinces and of revolutionary movements in the
                                Spanish-American republics, and on various other occasions,
                                including the existing insurrection in Cuba.</p>
                            <p>But although such acts of violation of law were frequent in Great
                                Britain, and susceptible of complete technical proof, notorious,
                                flaunted directly in the face of the world, varnished over, if at
                                all, with the shallowest pretext of deception, yet no efficient step
                                appears to have been taken by the British government to enforce the
                                execution of its municipal laws or to vindicate the majesty of its
                                outraged sovereign power.</p>
                            <p>And the Government of the United States cannot believe—it would
                                conceive itself wanting in respect for Great Britain to impute—that
                                the Queen’s ministers are so much hampered by judicial difficulties
                                that the local administration is thus reduced to such a state of
                                legal impotency as to deprive the government of capacity to uphold
                                its sovereignty against local wrong-doers, or its neutrality as
                                regards other sovereign powers.</p>
                            <p>If, indeed, it were so, the causes of reclamation on the part of the
                                United States would only be the more positive and sure; for the law
                                of nations assumes that each government is capable of discharging
                                its international obligations; and, perchance, if it be not, then
                                the absence of such capability is itself a specific ground of
                                responsibility for consequences.</p>
                            <p>But the Queen’s government would not be content to admit, nor will
                                the Government of the United States presume to impute to it, such
                                political organization of the British empire as to imply any want of
                                legal ability on its part to discharge, in the amplest manner, all
                                its duties of sovereignty and amity toward other powers.</p>
                            <p>It remains only in this relation to refer to one other point, namely,
                                the question of <hi rend="italic">negligence;</hi> neglect on the
                                part of officers of the British government, whether superior or
                                subordinate, to detain confederate cruisers, and especially the
                                Alabama, the most successful of the depredators on the commerce of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>On this point the President conceives that little needs now to be
                                said, for various cogent reasons.</p>
                            <p>First, the matter has been exhaustively discussed already by this
                                Department, or by the successive American ministers.</p>
                            <p>Then, if the question of negligence be discussed with frankness, it
                                must be treated in this instance as a ease of extreme negligence,
                                which Sir William Jones has taught us to regard as equivalent or
                                approximate to evil intention. The question of negligence,
                                therefore, cannot be presented without danger of thought or language
                                disrespectful toward the Queen’s ministers, and the President, while
                                purposing, of course, as his sense of duty requires, to sustain the
                                rights of the United States in all their utmost amplitude, yet
                                intends to speak and act in relation to Great Britain in the same
                                spirit of international respect which he expects of her in relation
                                to the United States, and he is sincerely desirous that all
                                discussions between the governments may be so conducted as not only
                                to prevent any aggravation of existing differences, but to tend to
                                such reasonable and amicable determination as best becomes two great
                                nations of common origin and conscious dignity and strength.</p>
                            <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0392"/>
                            <p>I assume, therefore, pretermitting detailed discussion in this
                                respect, that the negligence of the officers of the British
                                government in the matter of the Alabama, at least, was gross and
                                inexcusable, and such as indisputably to devolve on that government
                                full responsibility for all the depredations committed by her.
                                Indeed, this conclusion seems in effect to be conceded in Great
                                Britain. At all events, the United States conceive that the proofs
                                of responsible negligence in this matter are so clear that no room
                                remains for debate on that point, and it should be taken for granted
                                in all future negotiations with Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>It is impossible not to compare and contrast the conduct of the
                                States General, as regards Great Britain on occasion of the revolt
                                of the British colonies, with that of Great Britain as regards the
                                insurrection in the Southern States. No fleets were fitted out by
                                America in the ports of the Netherlands to prey on the commerce of
                                Great Britain. Only in a single instance did American cruisers have
                                temporary harborage in the Texel. Year after year the exports of
                                munitions of war for the Netherlands were forbidden by the States
                                General, the more completely to fulfill their duty of amity and
                                neutrality toward Great Britain; but, nevertheless, Great Britain
                                treated a declaration of neutrality by the States General, and the
                                observance of that declaration, as a sufficient cause of war against
                                the Netherlands; prior to which the British government continually
                                complained of the occasional supplies derived by the colonies from
                                the island of St. Eustatius. How light, in this respect, would have
                                been the burdens of the United States during the late insurrection
                                if British aid had been confined to a contraband commerce between
                                the insurgents and the port of Nassau.</p>
                            <p>Not such is the complaint of the United States against Great Britain.
                                We complain that the insurrection in the Southern States, if it did
                                not exist, was continued, and obtained its enduring vitality, by
                                means of the resources it drew from Great Britain. We complain that
                                by reason of the imperfect discharge of its neutral duties on the
                                part of the Queen’s government, Great Britain became the military,
                                naval, and financial basis of insurgent warfare against the United
                                States. We complain of the destruction of our merchant-marine by
                                British ships manned by British seamen, armed with British guns,
                                dispatched from British dock-yards, sheltered and harbored in
                                British ports. We complain that, by reason of the policy and the
                                acts of the Queen’s ministers, injury incalculable was inflicted on
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the United States manfully and resolvedly encountered
                                all the great perils and difficulties of the situation, foreign and
                                domestic, and overcame them. We endured, with proud patience, the
                                manifestation of hostility there, where we had expected friendship,
                                in England, the protagonist of the abolition of negro servitude, in
                                order to perpetuate which the Southern States had seceded from the
                                Union. We entered on a great war, involving sea and land; we marched
                                to the field hundreds of thousands of soldiers and expended
                                thousands of millions of treasure for their support; we lavished the
                                blood of our bravest and best in battle, as if it were but water; we
                                submitted to all privations without a murmur; we staked our lives,
                                our fortunes, and our honor on the issue of the combat; and, by the
                                blessing of God, we came out of the deadly struggle victorious, and
                                with courage proved, strength unimpaired, power augmented, and our
                                place fixed among the nations second to none, we may without
                                presumption say, in the civilized world. Providence had smiled On
                                our sacrifices and our exertions; and in the hour of supreme triumph
                                we felt that, while mindful of goodwill shown us by friendly powers
                                in the hour of trial, we could afford to account in moderation with
                                others, which, like Great Britain, had, as we thought, speculated
                                improvidently, and to their own discomfiture, on the expected
                                dismemberment and downfall of the great American republic.</p>
                            <p>As to Great Britain, we had special and peculiar causes of grief. She
                                had prematurely, as we deemed it, and without adequate reason,
                                awarded the status of belligerency to our insurgents. But this act
                                of itself, and by its inherent nature, was of neutral color, and an
                                act which, howsoever we might condemn it in the particular case, we
                                could not deny to be of the competency of a sovereign state. Other
                                European governments also recognized the belligerency of the
                                insurgent s; but Great Britain alone had translated a measure
                                indefinite of itself into one of definite wrong to the United
                                States; as evinced by the constant and efficient aid in ships and
                                munitions of war which she furnished the confederates, and in the
                                permission or negligence which enabled confederate cruisers from her
                                ports to prey on the commerce of the United States. Great Britain
                                alone had founded on that recognition a systematic maritime war
                                against the United States. And this, to effect the establishment of
                                a slave government; as to which Mr. Bright might well say, “We
                                supply the ships; we supply the arms, the munitions of war; we give
                                aid and comfort to the foulest of crimes; <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Englishmen only</hi> do it.” Thus, what in France, in Spain, as
                                their subsequent conduct showed, had been but an untimely and
                                ill-judged act of political manifestation, had in England, as her
                                subsequent conduct showed, been a virtual act of war. We reflected
                                that the confederates had no ships, no means of building ships, no
                                mechanical appliances, no marine, no legal <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status</hi> on the sea, no open sea-ports, no possible courts
                                of prize, no domestic command of the instruments and agencies of
                                modern maritime warfare. We asked ourselves what would the Queen’s
                                government <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0393"/>have said if the
                                United-States had awarded the rights of belligerency to insurgents
                                in India, or in Ireland, in the same circumstances, that is, on the
                                occurrence of a single act of rebel hostility, and had bestowed upon
                                them their only means of maritime as well as territorial warfare
                                against Great Britain?</p>
                            <p>In truth, while, in the hour of their great triumph, the United
                                States were thankfully inclined to sentiments of moderation, both at
                                home and abroad—for at home no man has suffered death for political
                                causes—were the more inclined to moderation, especially, as regards
                                Great Britain, in view of the very enormity of the wrongs we had
                                sustained, and the consequent difficulty of measuring the reparation
                                due, even if sincerely proffered by the Queen’s government—we
                                desired no war with England; we shrank from the thought of another
                                lustrum of fratricidal carnage, like that through which we had just
                                passed, with no change in the conditions of war but the
                                substitution, on one side, of misguided Englishmen in the place of
                                misguided Americans. “We preferred, if possible, to find some
                                satisfaction of our great grievances by peaceful means, consistent
                                alike with the honor of Great Britain and of the United States. The
                                influence of this condition of mind is apparent in all the
                                discussions of the subject by or under the instruction of this
                                Department during preceding administrations of the Government. It
                                resulted in earnest efforts on our part to determine the controversy
                                by arbitration in the interest of peace and of international
                                good-will, which efforts, if promptly met by the Queen’s ministers
                                in the spirit in which they were made, would long since have removed
                                the present controversy from the fields of diplomacy, and
                                effectually harmonized the relations of the United States with Great
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>But the amicable advances of the United States to dispose of the
                                question by arbitration were at the start, and persistently long
                                afterward, met by Lord Russell, in the name of the Queen’s
                                government, with subtleties of reservation and exception, the effect
                                of which would have been, instead of closing up the controversy, to
                                leave us in a condition worse than before, and more perilous to the
                                cause of peace.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States has never been able to appreciate
                                the force of the reasons alleged in support of such reservations and
                                exceptions. When one power demands of another the redress of alleged
                                wrongs, and the latter entertains the idea of arbitration as the
                                means of settling the question, it seems irrational to insist that
                                the arbitration shall be a qualified and limited one, through
                                apprehensions lest, peradventure, there might thus be implication
                                that such wrongs had been committed by intention, and that such
                                implication would be injurious to the honor of the wrong-doing
                                government. On these premises arbitration may be the means of
                                adjusting immaterial international wrongs, but not of material ones;
                                that is to say, if the grievances be serious, the two nations must
                                of necessity go to war, while-neither desires it, which would be an
                                absurd conclusion.</p>
                            <p>Lord Stanley and Lord Clarendon appear to have seen this, and
                                therefore to have regarded the particular question with more correct
                                estimation of its incidents than Lord Russell, and thereupon to have
                                admitted as theory comprehensive arbitration concerning all
                                questions between the governments.</p>
                            <p>But the convention, which in this view was negotiated by the Earl of
                                Clarendon and Mr. Reverdy Johnson, did not prove satisfactory to the
                                Senate of the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is well known to the government of Great Britain that the
                                President and the Senate of the United States aro distinct powers of
                                the Government, associated in the conclusion of treaties and in the
                                appointment of public officers, but not dependent one on the other,
                                nor of necessity entertaining the same opinion on public questions.
                                Each acts on appropriate convictions of duty and of right, and the
                                Senate has the same absolute power to reject a treaty as the
                                President has to negotiate one.</p>
                            <p>Of course it is not necessarily incumbent on the President to express
                                approval or disapproval of an act of the Senate.</p>
                            <p>But the President deems it due to the Senate, to himself, and to the
                                subject, to declare that he concurs with the Senate in disapproving
                                of that convention. His own particular reasons for his conclusion
                                are sufficiently apparent in this dispatch. In addition to these
                                general reasons, he thinks the provisions of the convention were
                                inadequate to provide reparation for the United States in the manner
                                and to the degree to which he considers the United States entitled
                                to redress. Other and special reasons for the same conclusions have
                                been explained in a previous dispatch—such, namely, as the time and
                                circumstances of the negotiation, the complex character of the
                                proposed arbitration, its chance, agency, and results, and its
                                failure to determine any principle, or otherwise to fix on a stable
                                foundation the relations of the two governments.</p>
                            <p>The President is not yet prepared to pronounce on the question of the
                                indemnities which he thinks due by Great Britain to individual
                                citizens of the United States, for the destruction of their property
                                by rebel cruisers fitted out in the ports of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>Nor is he now prepared to speak of the reparation which he thinks due
                                by the British government for the larger account of the vast <hi
                                    rend="italic">national</hi> injuries it has inflicted on the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>Nor does he attempt now to measure the relative effect of the various
                                causes of injury, as whether by untimely recognition of
                                belligerency, by suffering the fitting out of rebel <pb n="336"
                                    xml:id="pg_336" facs="0394"/>cruisers, or by the supply of
                                ships, arms, and munitions of war to the confederates, or otherwise,
                                in whatsoever manner.</p>
                            <p>Nor does it fall within the scope of this dispatch to discuss the
                                important changes in the rules of public law, the desirableness of
                                which has been demonstrated by the incidents of the last few years
                                now under consideration, and which, in view of the maritime
                                prominence of Great Britain and the United States, it would befit
                                them to mature, and propose to the other states of Christendom.</p>
                            <p>All these are subjects of future consideration; which, when the time
                                for action shall arrive, the President will consider with sincere
                                and earnest desire that all differences between the two nations may
                                be adjusted amicably and compatibly with the honor of each, and to
                                the promotion of future concord between them; to which end ‘he will
                                spare no effort within the range of his supreme duty to the rights
                                and interest of the United States.</p>
                            <p>At the present stage of the controversy, the sole object of the
                                President is to state the position and maintain the attitude of the
                                United States in the various relations and aspects of this grave
                                controversy with Great Britain. It is the object of this paper
                                (which you are at liberty to read to Lord Clarendon) to state calmly
                                and dispassionately, with a more unreserved freedom than might be
                                used in one addressed directly to the Queen’s government, what this
                                Government seriously considers the injuries she has suffered. It is
                                not written in the nature of a claim, for the United States now make
                                no demand against her Majesty’s government on account of the
                                injuries they feel that they have sustained.</p>
                            <p>Although the United States are anxious for a settlement on a liberal
                                and comprehensive basis of all the questions which now interfere
                                with the entirely cordial relations which they desire to exist
                                between the two governments, they do not now propose or desire to
                                set any time for this settlement. On the contrary, they prefer to
                                leave that question, and also the more important question of the
                                means and method of removing the causes of complaint, of restoring
                                the much desired relations of perfect cordiality, and the preventing
                                of the probability of like questions in the future, to the
                                consideration of her Majesty’s government. They will, however, be
                                ready, whenever her Majesty’s government shall think the proper time
                                has come for a renewed negotiation, to entertain any proposition
                                which that government shall think proper to present, and to apply to
                                such propositions their earnest and sincere wishes and endeavors for
                                a solution honorable and satisfactory to both countries.</p>

                                    Seward as to the “precipitate recognition “of belligerent
                                    rights, which, he says, “appears in its having been determined
                                    on the 6th of May, four days prior to the arrival in London of
                                    any official knowledge of the President’s proclamation of the
                                    19th of April, 1861.” * * * * and “signed on the 13th of May—the
                                    very day of the arrival of Mr. Adams, the new American minister,
                                    as if in the particular aim of forestalling and preventing
                                    explanations on the part of the United States.”</p>
                                <p>The facts are—</p>
                                <p>The President’s proclamation of blockade was published April 19.
                                    Intelligence of its issue was received by telegraph (see the
                                    Times) on the 2d of May.</p>
                                <p>It was published in the Daily News and other papers on the 3d of
                                    May. Mr. Seward, in his dispatch to Mr. Adams of the 12th of
                                    January, 1867, says, “it reached London on the 3d of May.”</p>
                                <p>A copy was received officially from her Majesty’s consul at New
                                    York on the 5th; another copy, from Lord Lyons, on the 10th.</p>
                                <p>It was communicated officially by Mr. Dallas to Lord Russell on
                                    the 11th, with a copy of a circular from Mr. Seward to the
                                    United States ministers abroad, dated the 20th of April, calling
                                    attention to it, and stating the probability that attempts would
                                    be made to “fit out privateers in the ports of England for the
                                    purpose of aggression on the commerce of the United States.”</p>
                                <p>The reason of the delay in receiving the copy from Washington was
                                    in itself a proof of the existence of civil war, arising, as it
                                    did, from the communication between <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"

                                <p>The prematureness of the measure is further shown by the very
                                    tenor of the proclamation: “Whereas hostilities have unhappily
                                    commenced between the Government of the United States of America
                                    and certain States styling themselves the Confederate States of
                                    America.” Exception is also taken to the use of the word
                                    “contest” as distinct from “war.”</p>
                                <p>It will be seen, on referring to the report of the royal
                                    commission for inquiring into the neutrality laws, (Appendix,)
                                    that the form of words used is taken from previous
                                    proclamations: “Whereas hostilities at this time exist,” (June
                                    6, 1823;) “engaged in a contest,” (September 30, 1825, Turkey
                                    and Greece;) “Whereas hostilities have unhappily commenced,”
                                    (May 13, 1859, Austria, France, and Italy.) The same form was
                                    used in the case of Spain and Chili, (February 6, 1866,) and
                                    Spain and Peru, (March 13, 1866.) “Hostilities have unhappily
                                    commenced,” (Austria, Prussia. Italy, Germany, June 27,
                                    1866.)</p>
                                <p>The order prohibiting prizes from being brought into British
                                    ports, for which the United States Government thanked the
                                    British government, as being likely to give a death-blow to
                                    privateering, speaks of “observing the strictest neutrality in
                                    the contest which appears to be imminent,” (June 1, 1861.)</p>
                                <p>It is remarkable that in the case of Turkey and Greece, British
                                    subjects were warned to respect “the exercise of belligerent
                                    rights.” This is omitted in the United States case, the
                                    belligerents being spoken of as “the contending parties.”</p>
                                <p>The expression, “States styling themselves the Confederate States
                                    of America,” was purposely adopted to avoid the recognition of
                                    their existence as independent States, and gave them great
                                    offense.</p>
                                <p>The French proclamation of the 10th of June has “la lutte engagée
                                    entre le Gouvernement de l'Union et les Etats prétendent former
                                    une Confédération particulière.”</p>
                                <p>The Spanish proclamation, which the United States minister at
                                    Madrid (see Diplomatic Correspondence laid before Congress,
                                    1861, p. 224) informed the Spanish government “the President had
                                    read with the greatest satisfaction,” issued on the 17th of
                                    June, 1861, has “Confederate States of the South,” and uses the
                                    term “belligerent” three times over.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Fish’s dispatch states that the “assumed belligerency” was a
                                    “fiction,” the “anticipation of supposed belligerency to come,
                                    but which might never have come if not thus anticipated and
                                    encouraged by the Queen’s government.”</p>
                                <p>What are the facts? A large group of States, containing a
                                    population of several millions, and comprising a compact
                                    geographical area, enabling them to act readily in concert, had
                                    established a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government, with a
                                    president, congress, constitution, courts of justice, army, and
                                    all the machinery of military and civil power. They possessed
                                    the ports along upward of 2,000 miles of coast; with the
                                    exception of Forts Pickens and Monroe, all the Federal posts and
                                    forts had been evacuated, including Harper’s Ferry, the arsenal
                                    of the Potomac Valley. Fort Sumter, the only one which had
                                    offered resistance, had fallen a month previously, April 13. The
                                    confederate troops were in occupation of the Shenandoah lines,
                                    and threatening Washington. The confederate president had
                                    declared war, and called for a levy of 32,000 troops, to which
                                    all the seceded States had responded promptly. On the other
                                    hand, the Federal President had called for 75,000 volunteers on
                                    the 15th of April, and for 42,000 more on the 3d of May; and as
                                    fast as the regiments could be armed they were hurrying to the
                                    defense of Washington. The contending armies were, indeed, face
                                    to face.</p>
                                <p>So much for the hostilities on land. The operations at sea, in
                                    which British interests were more directly affected, had been
                                    carried on with equal vigor. On the 17th of April the
                                    confederate president issued his proclamation offering to grant
                                    letters of marque, which was followed, two days afterward, by
                                    the Federal proclamation of blockade. At the date of the Queen’s
                                    proclamation of neutrality both these had been carried, or were
                                    being carried, into effect. The Federal Government had
                                    instituted the blockade of Virginia and North Carolina, which
                                    was declared to be effective on the 30th of April, and were
                                    rapidly dispatching all the merchant-vessels which they could
                                    procure, and which they were able to convert into ships-of-war,
                                    to the blockade of the other ports. The General Parkhill, of
                                    Liverpool, was captured by the United States ship Niagara while
                                    attempting to run the blockade of Charleston, on the 12th of
                                    May; and the British vessels Hilja and Monmouth warned off on
                                    the same day. Confederate privateers were already at sea. One
                                    was captured at the mouth of the Chesapeake River on the 8th of
                                    May by the United States ship Harriet Lane. On the 15th the
                                    Federal bark Ocean Eagle, of Rockhead, Maine, was taken by the
                                    confederate privateer Calhoun off New Orleans. At the same port
                                    Captain Semmes had already received his commission, and was
                                    engaged in the outfit of the Sumter.</p>
                                <p>Could any explanations which Mr. Adams might have had to offer
                                    alter such a state of things as this? Can any other name be
                                    given to it than that of civil war?</p>
                                <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0396"/>
                                <p>It is stated that there was no fact of continued and flagrant
                                    “hostilities" to justify the action of Great Britain in issuing
                                    a proclamation of neutrality. Mr. Seward writing at the time,
                                    and previously to the Queen’s proclamation, (May 4,)
                                    characterized the proceedings of the confederates as “open,
                                    flagrant, deadly war,” and as “civil war,” (Congress Papers,
                                    1861, page 165;) and in a communication to M. de Tassara, the
                                    Spanish minister, referred to the operations of the Federal
                                    blockade as belligerent operations which would be carried on
                                    with due respect to the rights of neutrals.</p>
                                <p>Judge Betts, in the cases of the Hiawatha, &amp;c., said: “I
                                    consider that the outbreak in particular States, as also in the
                                    confederated States, was an open and flagrant civil war.”</p>
                                <p>It is also judicially decided by the Supreme Court of the United
                                    States, in the ease of the Amy Warwick and other prizes, that
                                    “the proclamation of blockade is itself official and conclusive
                                    evidence that a state of war existed which demanded and
                                    authorized such a measure.” Moreover, the joint resolution of
                                    Congress, in July, 1861, approving and confirming the acts of
                                    the President, (North America, No. 1, 1862,” page 57,)
                                    commences: “Whereas, since the adjournment of Congress on the
                                    4th of March last, a formidable insurrection in certain States
                                    of this Union has arrayed itself in armed hostility;” and a
                                    resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d of July,
                                    1861, speaks of the “present deplorable civil war” and of "this
                                    war.”</p>
                                <p>The date at which the civil war actively commenced has,
                                    therefore, been fixed by the published dispatches of the
                                    Secretary of State, by proceedings in Congress, by the formal
                                    judgment of the United States prize-courts, as well as by the
                                    universal assent of all the neutral powers concerned; but it is
                                    urged that, nevertheless, there was no necessity for Great
                                    Britain to take notice of it, as no ship of the insurgents had
                                    appeared in British ports, no collision occurred at sea, nor did
                                    the nearness of Great Britain to the seat of hostilities compel
                                    her to act.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the latter point, it is difficult to see how one
                                    nation can be much nearer to another than England to the United
                                    States, seeing that the British dominions, touch the United
                                    States on two sides, while the British islands of New
                                    Providence, &amp;c., lie immediately in front. As to a collision
                                    at sea, it was apparent that British commerce must be interfered
                                    with the moment the blockade came into operation, as indeed was
                                    the case, several British vessels having been captured before
                                    there was time for the intelligence of the proclamation of
                                    neutrality to reach America. As to the arrival of confederate
                                    ships in British ports, such ships were afloat and might at any
                                    time be expected. As Mr. Dana, in the notes to the eighth
                                    edition of Wheaton, expresses it, (p. 35,) “it is not fit that
                                    cases should be left to be decided as they may arise, by private
                                    citizens, or naval or judicial officers, at home or abroad, by
                                    sea or land.”</p>
                                <p>The British government were compelled to take action of some
                                    sort. Was that action really unfriendly; was it intended to be
                                    unfriendly?</p>
                                <p>No one who recollects what actually passed, or will consult
                                    “Hansard,” can suppose that the proclamation was intended to be
                                    unfriendly. On the contrary, as was stated by Mr. Forster in his
                                    speech at Bradford, it was absolutely pressed upon the
                                    government by the friends of the Northern States, who were
                                    afraid lest confederate privateers, should be fitted out in
                                    British ports.</p>
                                <p>Nor was its immediate result injurious to the Federal States. Far
                                    from being so, it legitimatized the captures of the blockading
                                    squadron, and, in the language of the prize-court, “estopped”
                                    the British merchants, whose vessels were seized, from making
                                    reclamation.</p>
                                <p>While the intelligence of the issue of the Queen’s proclamation
                                    was still fresh, and almost immediately after hearing of the
                                    French and Spanish proclamations of neutrality, the President,
                                    in his message of the 4th of July, 1861, stated that he was
                                    “happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the United

                                    general sympathy with the country is manifested.’ throughout the
                                    world.”</p>
                                <p>Does any one really believe that the Queen’s proclamation in the
                                    very least influenced the movements of the confederate armies?
                                    All the preparations for war had been made long before,
                                    munitions collected, troops levied, and generals appointed. The
                                    proclamation reached America at the end of May, by which time
                                    the confederates had taken up their position on the Upper
                                    Potomac, and the Federals had occupied Alexandria, in Virginia,
                                    with a force of thirteen thousand men, May 24.</p>
                                <p>The armies on both sides were in motion; skirmishes were daily
                                    occurring; engagements took place at Little Bethel on the 10th
                                    of June, at Carthage, Missouri, on the 6th of July, and at
                                    Centreville on the 18th, followed by the great battle of
                                    Manassas Junction on the 21st. Can any one suppose that if the
                                    proclamation had not been issued that battle would not have been
                                    fought?</p>
                                <p>The charge of premature recognition, on examination, reduces
                                    itself to this, that the proclamation ought not to have been
                                    issued until Mr. Adams arrived, or until some event called for
                                    it. Against this is to be set the fact that the proclamation was
                                    considered by some friends of the Northern States as a step
                                    taken in their interests and <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
                                        facs="0397"/>that It was further pressed upon the government
                                    by Mr. Dallas’s communication of Mr. Seward’s circular.
                                    Moreover, confederate privateers were at sea, and British
                                    vessels being made prizes by the Federal blockading fleet.</p>
                                <p>Besides the assertion of the premature recognition of belligerent
                                    rights, the dispatch states that maritime enterprises in the
                                    ports of Great Britain which would otherwise have been piratical
                                    were, “by virtue of the proclamation,” rendered lawful, “and
                                    thus Great Britain became, and to the end continued to be, the
                                    arsenal, the navy-yard, and the treasury of the insurgent
                                    confederacy.”</p>
                                <p>Mr. Fish, in a preceding passage, admits that national
                                    belligerency is “an existing fact,” and he might Lave added that
                                    it exists independently of any official proclamations of neutral
                                    powers, as is shown by the records of the American prize-courts,
                                    which continually recognize the belligerency of the South
                                    American States; although, as Mr. Seward stated in one of his
                                    dispatches, the United States have never issued a proclamation
                                    of neutrality except in the case of France and England, in 1793.
                                    This was proved in the civil war by the reception at Curaçoa of
                                    the confederate vessel Sumter as a belligerent cruiser, though
                                    the Netherlands had issued no proclamation of neutrality. It was
                                    this recognition of the Sumter, after her departure from New
                                    Orleans, (July 6, 1861,) at Curaçoa, and at Cienfuegos, which
                                    first practically accorded maritime belligerent rights to the
                                    confederates, a fact which is overlooked when it is alleged that
                                    confederate “belligerency, so far as it was maritime,” proceeded
                                    "from the ports of Great Britain and her dependencies
                                    alone.”</p>
                                <p>Indeed, it is not going too far to say that the confederates
                                    derived no direct benefit from the proclamation. Their
                                    belligerency depended upon the fact (a fact which, when we are
                                    told that the civil war left behind it two millions and a half
                                    of dead and maimed, is unfortunately indisputable) that they
                                    were waging civil war. If there had been no proclamation, the
                                    fact would have remained the same, and belligerency would have
                                    had to be recognized either on behalf of the Northern States by
                                    admitting the validity of captures on the high seas for the
                                    carriage of contraband or breach of blockade, or on the arrival
                                    of the Sumter, or some similar vessel, in a British port.</p>
                                <p>In no case can it be really supposed that the recognition of
                                    belligerency, which, unless neutral nations abandoned their
                                    neutrality and took an active part in the contest, was
                                    inevitable, materially influenced the fortunes of such a fearful
                                    and protracted civil war.</p>
                                <p>At all events, if it did, the confederates never acknowledged it;
                                    the recognition of belligerency they regarded (as indeed was the
                                    case) as a right which could not be denied to them. What they
                                    sought was not the mere technical title of “belligerents,” but a
                                    recognition of independence; and when they found that it was
                                    hopeless to expect England to accord it, they cut off all
                                    intercourse with this country, expelled her Majesty’s consuls
                                    from their towns, and did everything in their power to show the
                                    sense which they entertained of the injury which they believed
                                    had been inflicted upon them. The result being that, while one
                                    side has blamed us for doing too much, the other side has blamed
                                    us for doing too little; and thus an assumption of neutrality
                                    has been regarded both by North and South as an attitude of
                                    hostility.</p>
                                <p>As to the Queen’s proclamation, rendering lawful the dispatch of
                                    the Alabama, Shenandoah, and Georgia, from British ports, to
                                    which it is to be presumed the expression “maritime enterprise”
                                    refers, it is to be remarked that it is exactly against such
                                    enterprises that the proclamation reciting the terms of the
                                    foreign enlistment act was intended to warn British subjects.
                                    Instead of rendering them lawful, it rendered them additionally
                                    unlawful, by giving notice of their illegality.</p>
                                <p>There would be no difficulty in showiug by precedents from
                                    American prize-courts that no proclamation of neutrality is
                                    required to confer belligerent rights on vessels commissioned by
                                    a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government.</p>
                                <p>It is admitted that at the time these “enterprises” were
                                    undertaken “hostilities” in America were being prosecuted “on a
                                    scale of gigantic magnitude.” After, therefore, the Alabama
                                    escaped on the 29th of July, 1862, she became, by virtue of her
                                    confederate commission, undoubtedly a belligerent cruiser,
                                    irrespective of any acknowledgment of belligerency by Great
                                    Britain, and was received accordingly by the French authorities
                                    at Martinique, where she first touched after leaving
                                    Liverpool.</p>
                                <p>A pirate is <hi rend="italic">hostis humani generis</hi>, one
                                    owing obedience to no authority. If the Alabama had been really
                                    a pirate depredating on American commerce, it would have been
                                    the duty of the French to seize her and execute justice on her
                                    commander and crew, a pirate being triable wheresoever
                                    found.</p>
                                <p>Judge Nelson, in the case of the confederate privateer Savannah,
                                    ruled that though confederate privateers were pirates <hi
                                        rend="italic">quoad</hi> American jurisdiction, they were
                                    not pirates <hi rend="italic">jure gentium;</hi> and, in the
                                    case of the Golden Rocket, in which the owner brought an action
                                    in an American court against an insurance company for the
                                    capture of his ship by the Florida, he being insured against
                                    piracy, but not against war risk, it was decided that captures
                                    by confederate cruisers were not “piracy” within the usual
                                    meaning of the word, and that the company was not liable.</p>
                                <p>The American courts having thus conclusively dealt with the
                                    matter, it is unnecessary <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340"
                                        facs="0398"/>to pursue the subject further. What is probably
                                    meant is that, if the confederates had not possessed a <hi
                                        rend="italic">de facto</hi> government, and had not been
                                    belligerents in the sense of waging public war, vessels under
                                    their commission would have been mere roving adventurers,
                                    pursuing merchantmen for the sake of private plunder; in short,
                                    pirates; but by the admission that “hostilities” (the very word
                                    to which exception is taken in the neutrality proclamation) were
                                    being prosecuted on a great scale, the only ground on which such
                                    a supposition could rest is cut away.</p>

                                <p>The Florida was detained at Nassau on suspicion, but discharged
                                    by the local admiralty court, there being no evidence of her
                                    being anything but a blockade-runner. She was fitted out as a
                                    ship of war at Mobile.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, the British government prevented the outfit of
                                    the Rappahannock, prosecuted and detained the Alexandria, seized
                                    the Liverpool rams, and stopped the Pampero, besides
                                    investigating carefully every case of suspected outfit brought
                                    forward by Mr. Adams, and he complained of nineteen, as well as
                                    every case which could be discovered independently. Among other
                                    things, taking charge of Captain Osborne’s Anglo-Chinese
                                    flotillia, which it was apprehended might fall into the hands of
                                    the confederates, at a cost to this country of £100,000.</p>
                                <p>That any sea-going steamer can be converted into a cruiser by
                                    strengthening her bulk-heads and arming her, which can be done
                                    at sea as well as on shore, is proved by the fact that the most
                                    efficient blockading vessels in the Federal Navy were converted
                                    blockade-runners.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">The Alabama.</hi>—Mr. Fish speaks of the
                                    neglect of the officers of the British government to detain
                                    confederate cruisers, and especially the Alabama.</p>
                                <p>There was no neglect to detain the Shenandoah or Georgia, for the
                                    reason that neither the government nor its officers knew they
                                    were being intended for the confederate service. Indeed, it has
                                    never been proved that the persons who sold those vessels knew
                                    it. Probably they did, but a case might very readily arise in
                                    which the vendors might be really ignorant. The American
                                    government could not have expected the English revenue officers
                                    to prevent every large steamer leaving England in ballast.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the Alabama, it is assumed “that the negligence of
                                    the officers of the British government was gross and
                                    inexcusable, and such as to indisputably to devolve on that
                                    government full responsibility for all the depredations
                                    committed by her. Indeed, this conclusion seems in effect to be
                                    conceded in Great Britain. At all events, the United States
                                    conceive that the proofs of responsible negligence in this
                                    matter are so clear that no room remains for debate on that
                                    point; and it <hi rend="italic">should be taken for granted in
                                        all future negotiations with Great Britain.”</hi></p>
                                <p>By a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi>, the whole argument
                                    is thus assumed to be in favor of the United States.</p>
                                <p>There is no doubt that the Alabama might, if she had not escaped
                                    at the moment when the case against her appeared to be legally
                                    established, have been seized and tried under the foreign
                                    enlistment act, though the result, looking to what occurred in
                                    the case of the Alexandra, might have been doubtful.</p>
                                <p>This, however, is a very different thing from admitting that her
                                    sale to the confederates was a violation of British neutrality
                                    for which the nation is responsible. This <pb n="341"
                                        xml:id="pg_341" facs="0399"/>was the first instance which
                                    occurred of the sale of a ship under such circumstances, and the
                                    British government had, in fact, no suspicion of what was going
                                    to be done in the matter, no information having been received of
                                    an intention to take out her arms and crew in a separate
                                    vessel.</p>
                                <p>Judge Story, in the well-known case “Santissima Trinidad and
                                    Santander,” laid it down as indisputable that” there is nothing
                                    in our laws, or in the law of nations, that forbids our citizens
                                    from sending armed vessels, as well as munitions of war, to
                                    foreign ports for sale. It is a commercial venture which no
                                    nation is bound to prohibit, and which only exposes the persons
                                    engaged in it to the penalty of confiscation.”</p>
                                <p>But it must be remembered that when Mr. Fish claims compensation
                                    for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> her depredations, he should not
                                    overlook the fact of the negligence shown by the Federal Navy in
                                    twice letting her escape from them. First, when Mr. Adams urged
                                    the captain of the Federal ship, which at his instance had gone
                                    to Holyhead to look after her, to pursue her, when the captain
                                    refused and went off to his station at Gibraltar instead—a
                                    proceeding at which Mr. Adams expressed the greatest
                                    indignation; (see Congress Papers, 1862, p. 159;) and secondly,
                                    when the United States ship “San Jacinto “blockaded her in the
                                    French port of St. Pierre, Martinque, and then suffered her to
                                    slip away at night from under her bows.</p>
                                <p rend="center">

                                <p>Mr. Fish states that the confederates had no ships, no mechanical
                                    appliances, no open sea-ports, &amp;c., and implies that the
                                    maritime force of the confederates was entirely derived from
                                    England.</p>
                                <p>The Sumter, Nashville, and Florida, however, all sailed from
                                    confederate ports in which they were armed and fitted out,
                                    besides a variety of small coasting privateers, such as the
                                    Tallahassee, whose captures form a considerable item in the list
                                    of Federal maritime losses lately presented to Congress.</p>
                                <p>"On the land it was in like manner the munitions of war and the
                                    wealth drawn by the insurgents from Great Britain which enabled
                                    them to withstand, year after year, the arms of the United
                                    States.”</p>
                                <p>If, as Mr. Fish states, the confederates had no open sea-ports,
                                    how did these munitions and arms reach them?</p>
                                <p>Either the blockade was inefficient, in which case it was
                                    illegal, and neutral nations were not bound to respect it, or it
                                    was efficient, as it was recognized by Great Britain to be, and
                                    the supply of arms, &amp;c., was hazardous and uncertain.</p>
                                <p>There is no doctrine more clearly settled than that neutral
                                    nations are not responsible for the supplies of contraband sent
                                    through a blockade by their subjects. Indeed, the very existence
                                    of a blockade implies this, for, if it were the duty of neutrals
                                    to prevent the shipment of supplies to belligerents, why should
                                    there be a blockade at all? Each side would claim compensation
                                    for the assistance rendered to the other, and neutrality would
                                    become impossible.</p>
                                <p>If once it be conceded that blockade-running is an offense
                                    against neutrality in a civil war, the precedent would not fail
                                    to be invoked in all wars by whichever belligerent considered
                                    himself most aggrieved. Instead of establishing a principle in
                                    the interests of future peace, this would lead to endless
                                    complications and claims and counter-claims, which would make
                                    the end of one war the sure beginning of another.</p>
                                <p>The question of the action of the Dutch in the war of
                                    independence cannot be dealt with without a review of the
                                    history of the period, for which this memorandum does not afford
                                    space. An account of the proceedings at Saint Eustache, and
                                    subsequent discussions with the Dutch government, will be found

                                <p>As to the supplies sent through the blockade having been
                                    organized by confederate agents in England, the example was set
                                    them by the bureau established by Franklin at Paris for the
                                    assistance of the American provinces.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, it is notorious that the Federal troops were
                                    plentifully provided with arms and munitions from this

                                <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0400"/>
                                <p>This allegation of national, indirect or constructive, claims was
                                    first brought forward officially by Mr. Reverdy Johnson in his
                                    attempt to renew negotiations on the claims convention in March
                                    last. (North America, No. 1, 1869, page 46.)</p>
                                <p>Mr. Thornton has shown the difficulty there would be in computing
                                    the amount of claim even if it were acknowledged, (North
                                    America, No. 1, 1869, page 53,) in a dispatch I in which he
                                    mentions the continual decrease of American tonnage.</p>
                                <p>This is partly, no doubt, to be ascribed to the disturbance of
                                    commercial relations, consequent on a long war, partly to the
                                    fact that many vessels were nominally transferred to British
                                    owners during the war to escape capture. Sir E. Hornby, in a
                                    recent report, states that this was a constant practice in
                                    China.</p>
                                <p>Is not, however, a good deal of it to be attributed to the high
                                    American tariff, which makes the construction of vessels in
                                    American ports more expensive than ship-building in England, and
                                    has thereby thrown so large a proportion of the carrying trade
                                    into English hands?</p>
                                <p>There must be some such cause for it, or otherwise American
                                    shipping would have recovered its position since the war,
                                    instead of continuing to fall off.</p>

                                    in the events of the war itself, did the United States suffer
                                    more,” &amp;c.</p>
                                <p>No one can now wish to recall to recollection the particular
                                    events of that war; it would be much better for the two nations
                                    to congratulate themselves that one of the principal causes of
                                    it, the nationality dispute, has, it is to be hoped, been set at
                                    rest finally by Lord Stanley’s protocol.</p>
                                <p>V. The dispatch, in conclusion, refers “to important changes in
                                    the rules of public law,” the desirableness of which has been
                                    demonstrated, but does not say what are the changes to which it
                                    alludes.</p>
                                <p>This is in the spirit of the proposal made by Her Majesty’s
                                    government in December 1865, (North America, No. 1, 1866, page
                                    164:)</p>
                                <p>“I, however, asked Mr. Adams whether it would not be both useful
                                    and practical to let bygones be bygones, to forget the past, and
                                    turn the lessons of experience to account for the future.
                                    England and the United States, I said, had each become aware of
                                    the defects that existed in international law, and I thought it
                                    would greatly redound to the honor of the two principal maritime
                                    nations of the world to attempt the improvements in that code
                                    which had been proved to be necessary. It was possible, I added,
                                    that the wounds inflicted by the war were still too recent, and
                                    that the ill-will toward England was still too rife, to render
                                    such an undertaking practicable at the present moment; but it
                                    was one which ought to be borne in mind, and that was earnestly
                                    desired by Her Majesty’s government, as a means of promoting
                                    peace and abating the horrors of war; and a work, therefore,
                                    which would be worthy of the civilization of our age, and which
                                    would entitle the governments which achieved it to the gratitude
                                    of mankind.”</p>
                                <p>It is not necessary in this memorandum to dwell on the alleged
                                    efficiency of the American as compared to the English foreign
                                    enlistment act. The failure of the American act in the
                                    Portuguese cases, in the repeated filibustering expeditions of
                                    Walker against Central America, and the acquittal under it of
                                    Lopez, the invader of Cuba, are proofs that its action cannot
                                    always be relied upon; and this is further corroborated by the
                                    difficulties now being experienced in dealing with the Hornet at
                                    Wilmington. Although, as Mr. Fish says, there have been
                                    prosecutions under it, it is believed that from the trial of
                                    Gideon Henfield in 1793 to the present day there has never been
                                    a criminal conviction. The only result of the proceedings <hi
                                        rend="italic">in rem</hi> has been to restore prizes, never
                                    to punish privateering; and the effect of the bonds which the
                                    act provides may be taken that the <hi rend="italic">owners</hi>
                                    of a vessel shall not <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> employ
                                    her in a belligerent service, and which has, it is believed,
                                    never been practically enforced, is, as Mr. Bemis, of Boston,
                                    points out in his volume on American neutrality, to add so much
                                    to the price of the vessel.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the claims for “vast national injuries,” it may be
                                    as well to observe that Professor Woolsey, the eminent American
                                    jurist, has repudiated them as untenable, while the strongest
                                    arguments in favor of the recognition of confederate
                                    belligerency are to be found in the notes to Mr. Dana’s eighth
                                    edition of Wheaton; and Mr. Lawrence, (the editor of the second
                                    annotated edition of Wheaton,) in a recent speech at Bristol,
                                    stated that “as far as respects the complaint founded on the
                                    recognition of the belligerent rights of the confederates, I
                                    cannot use too strong language in pronouncing its utter baseless
                                    character. No tyro in international law is ignorant that
                                    belligerency is a simple question of fact. With the late Sir
                                    Cornewall Lewis, we may ask, if the array of a million of men on
                                    each side does not constitute belligerency, what is
                                    belligerency? But what was the proclamation of the President,
                                    followed up by the condemnation of your ships and cargoes for a
                                    violation of the blockade which is established, but the
                                    recognition of a state of war? At this moment the United States,
                                    in claiming the property of the late confederate government,
                                    place before your tribunals their title on the fact of their
                                    being the successors of a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                                    government. I repeat that, however valid our claims may be
                                    against you on other grounds there is not the slightest <pb

                                    against you based on the public admission of a notorious fact,

                                    of the Federal Government.”</p>
                                <p>The course pursued by Great Britain in toe contest between
                                    Hungary and Austria in 1848–'49 may be cited as being in
                                    striking contrast with the course pursued toward the United
                                    States in 1861.</p>
                                <p>After the suppression of the insurrection at Vienna (October 29,
                                    1848) the Austrian generals determined to march against Hungary.
                                    At this time the combined Austrian armies consisted of about
                                    135,000 men. The Hungarians, on the other hand, with about
                                    125,000 men, occupied their entire territory, including their
                                    capital and all their fortresses. The fortress of Komorn,
                                    perhaps the strongest in Europe, appears to have been held by
                                    the Hungarians until the end of the revolution. On the 13th of
                                    December, 1848, the Austrians seemed to have gained no
                                    victories. The capture of Raab, the first of a number of
                                    successes which they obtained prior to their complete defeat in
                                    March, 1849, did not occur until December 20, 1848; meanwhile
                                    the Hungarians had been organizing for nearly a year for the
                                    purpose of making war against Austria.</p>

                                <p>On the 11th of December, 1848, an envoy of the Hungarian
                                    executive government addressed a note to Viscount Palmerston,
                                    offering to furnish him with precise information of the actual
                                    state of the kingdom of Hungary, and asking an interview for
                                    that purpose.</p>

                                    the engine-room stores were put on board while she lay in the

                                    ordered to be buried under the coal by Mr. Rumble, the chief
                                    inspector of machinery afloat at Sheerness, and Mr. Ramsey, the

                                    743,) and agreed with them as to wages. Similar services were
                                    rendered by the petty officers of the government yard. Mr.

                                    Mr. Rumble, engaged boiler-makers to go to Calais, in which

                                    also participated as paymaster to the families of the men. (<hi

                                    which her former ownership, proximity to the yard while being

                                <p>The equipment proceeded up to the 24th of November. On that day
                                    the parties interested in her appear to have received
                                    intelligence which changed their plans, (<hi rend="italic">Vol.

                                    but returned in the tug. Bedding, blankets, and remaining part

                                    by Messrs. Jones &amp; Co., of Liverpool. These certificates

                                    of men for service on her. On the 16th, (<hi rend="italic">Vol.

                                <p>In 1867 the British government appointed a commission to inquire
                                    into and consider the character, working, and effect of the

                                    Great Britain was at peace. In 1868 this commission made a
                                    report, containing, among other things in the appendix, a
                                    memorandum by Mr. Abbott (now Lord Tenterden) of the various
                                    foreign enlistment acts of Great Britain and other countries,
                                    including the United States. This memorandum is to be found in
                                    the fourth volume of Claims against Great Britain, page 93 <hi

                                <p>It resulted from this report that the comprehensive enlistment

                                        >“Foreign Relations for 1870,” page 158</ref>, was
                                    passed.</p>
                                <p>It is not supposed that the liability of Great Britain to
                                    indemnify individual losses occasioned by the several cruisers
                                    will be seriously disputed, if it be first established that the
                                    cruisers were constructed, equipped, armed, or reinforced in her
                                    ports, in violation of her international obligations to the
                                    United States. But to make that point sure, the following
                                    correspondence (not contained in Mr. Abbott’s memorandum)
                                    between Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State, and Mr. Hammond,
                                    British minister at Washington, is introduced. This
                                    correspondence grew out of the illegal acts committed by French
                                    cruisers, alluded to in Mr. Abbott’s memorandum. It is to be
                                    observed that this correspondence took place before any statute
                                    or municipal law had been enacted by the United States, and the
                                    duty of the United States in that respect is placed upon its
                                    international obligations to Great Britain; and also that the
                                    action of the United States was taken without any information
                                    furnished by any agent or representative of the British

                                            <item>That all military equipments within the ports of
                                                the United States are forbidden to the vessels of
                                                the belligerent powers, even where they have been
                                                constituted vessels of war before their arrival in
                                                our ports; and where such equipments have been made
                                                before detection, they, are ordered to be suppressed
                                                when detected, and the vessel reduced to her

                                                altogether, depart and make prizes, the Executive
                                                has not undertaken to restore the prizes.</item>

                                    <p>With due care it can scarcely happen that military equipments
                                        of any magnitude shall escape discovery; those which are
                                        small may sometimes, perhaps, escape, but to pursue these so
                                        far as to decide that the smallest circumstances of military
                                        equipment to a vessel in our ports shall invalidate her
                                        prizes through all time, would be a measure of incalculable
                                        consequences. And since our interference must be governed by
                                        some general rule, and between great and small equipments no
                                        practicable line of distinction can be drawn, it will be
                                        attended with less evil on the whole to rely on the
                                        efficiency of the means of prevention, that they will reach
                                        with certainty equipments of any magnitude, and the great
                                        mass of those of smaller importance also; and if some should
                                        in the event escape all our vigilance, to consider these as
                                        of the number of cases which will at times baffle the
                                        restraints of the wisest and best-guarded rules which human
                                        foresight can devise. And I think we may safely rely that
                                        since the regulations which got into a course of execution
                                        about the middle of August last, it is scarcely possible
                                        that equipments of any importance should escape
                                        discovery.</p>
                                    <p>These principles showing that no demand of restitution lies
                                        on the ground of a mere military alteration, or an
                                        argumentation of force, I will consider your letter only as
                                        a complaint that the orders of the President prohibiting
                                        these have not had their effect in the case of the Industry,
                                        and inquire whether, if this be so, it has happened either
                                        from neglect or connivance in those charged with the
                                        execution of these orders. For this we must resort to facts,
                                        which shall be taken from the evidence furnished by yourself
                                        and the British vice-consul at Baltimore, and from that
                                        which shall accompany this letter.</p>
                                    <p>About the beginning of August the Industry is said to have
                                        arrived at Baltimore with the French fleet from San Domingo.
                                        The particular state of her armament on her arrival is
                                        lately questioned, but it is not questioned that she was an
                                        armed vessel of some degree. The Executive having received
                                        an intimation that two vessels were equipping themselves at
                                        Baltimore for a cruise, a letter was, on the 6th of August,
                                        addressed by the Secretary of War to the governor of
                                        Maryland, desiring an inquiry into the fact. In his absence,
                                        the executive council of Maryland charged one of their own
                                        body, the Hon. Mr. Kilty, with the inquiry. He proceeded to
                                        Baltimore, and, after two days’ examination, found no vessel
                                        answering the description of those which were the object of
                                        his inquiry. He then engaged the British vice-consul in the
                                        search, who was not able, any more than himself, to discover
                                        any such vessels. Captain Kilty, however, observing a
                                        schooner, which appeared to have been making some equipments
                                        for a cruise, to have added to her guns, and made some
                                        alteration to her waist, thought these circumstances merited
                                        examination, though the rules of August had not yet
                                        appeared. Finding that his inquiries excited suspicion, and
                                        fearing the vessel might be withdrawn, he had her seized,
                                        and proceeded in the investigation. He found that she was
                                        the schooner Industry, Captain Carvin, from San Domingo;
                                        that she had been an armed vessel for three years before her
                                        coming here, and as late as April last had mounted sixteen
                                        guns; that she now mounted only twelve, and he could not
                                        learn that she had procured any of these or done anything
                                        else, essential to her as a privateer, at Baltimore. He
                                        therefore discharged her, and on the 23d of August the
                                        executive Council made the report to the Secretary of War,
                                        of which I inclose you a copy.</p>
                                    <p>About a fortnight after this (September 6) you added to a
                                        letter on other business a short paragraph, saying that you
                                        had lately received information that a vessel named the
                                        Industry had, within the last five or six weeks, been armed,
                                        manned, and equipped in the port of Baltimore. The
                                        proceedings before mentioned, having been in another
                                        Department, were not then known to me. I therefore could
                                        only communicate this paragraph to the proper Department.
                                        The separation of the Executive within a week after
                                        prevented any explanations on the subject, and without them
                                        it was not in my power either to controvert or admit the
                                        information you had received. Under these circumstances I
                                        think you must be sensible, sir, that your conclusions from
                                        my silence, that I regarded the fact as proved, was not a
                                        very necessary one.</p>
                                    <p>New inquiries at that time could not have prevented the
                                        departure of the privateer or the capture of the Roehampton,
                                        for the privateer had then been out for some time, the
                                        Roehampton was already taken, and was arriving at Baltimore;
                                        which she did <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0415"/>about
                                        the day of the date of your letter. After her arrival new
                                        witnesses have come forward to prove that the Industry had
                                        made some military equipments at Baltimore before her
                                        cruise. The affidavits taken by the British vice-consul are
                                        dated about nine or ten days after the date of your letter
                                        and arrival of the Roehampton; and we have only to lament
                                        that those witnesses had not given their information to the
                                        vice-consul when Mr. Kilty engaged his aid in the inquiries
                                        he was making, and when it would have had the effect of our
                                        detaining the privateer till she should have reduced herself
                                        to the condition in which she was when she arrived in our
                                        ports, if she had really added anything to her then force.
                                        But supposing the testimony just and full, (though taken <hi
                                            rend="italic">ex parte</hi>, and not under the legal
                                        sanction of an oath,) yet the governor’s refusal to restore
                                        the prize was perfectly proper, for, as has been before
                                        observed, restitution has never been made by the Executive,
                                        nor can be made, on a mere clandestine alteration or
                                        augmentation of military equipment, which was all that the
                                        new testimony tended to prove.</p>
                                    <p>Notwithstanding, however, that the President thought the
                                        information obtained on the former occasion had cleared this
                                        privateer from any well-grounded cause of arrest, yet that
                                        which you have now offered opens a possibility that the
                                        former was defective. He has, therefore, desired new inquiry
                                        to be made before a magistrate legally authorized to
                                        administer an oath and indifferent to both parties; and
                                        should the result be that the vessel did really make any
                                        military equipments in our ports, instructions will be given
                                        to reduce her to her original condition whenever she shall
                                        again come into our ports.</p>
                                    <p>On the whole, sir, I hope you will perceive that, on the
                                        first intimation, through their own channels, and without
                                        waiting for information on your part, that a vessel was
                                        making military equipments at Baltimore, the Executive took
                                        the best measures for inquiring into the fact, in order to
                                        prevent or suppress such equipments; that an officer of high
                                        respectability was charged with the inquiry; that he made it
                                        with great diligence himself, and engaged similar inquiries
                                        on the part of your vice-consul; that neither of them could
                                        find that this privateer had made such equipments, or, of
                                        course, that there was any ground for reducing or detaining
                                        her; that at the date of your letter of September 6 (the
                                        first intimation received from you) the privateer was
                                        departed, had taken her prize, and that prize was arriving
                                        in port; that the new evidence, taken ten days after that
                                        arrival, can produce no other effect than the institution of
                                        a new inquiry, and a reduction of the force of the
                                        privateer, should she appear to have made any military
                                        alterations or augmentation, on her return into our ports;
                                        and that in no part of this procedure is there the smallest
                                        ground for imputing either negligence or connivance to any
                                        of the officers who have acted in it.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your communications of the 6th instant
                                arrived in the absence of Governor Lee, who is gone to the Virginia
                                Springs. They were, of course, taken into consideration by the
                                council, whose assistance the governor, for reasons stated to you in
                                his letter of the 6th June last, has constantly required in matters
                                of this kind. We immediately adopted the expedient of deputing a
                                member to Baltimore, furnished with all the authority we could
                                confer, to carry the views of the President into effect. Captain
                                Kilty, who accepted this mission, has returned, and reports as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>That on his arrival in Baltimore he began and for two days pursued a
                                diligent inquiry respecting, the two vessels said to be fitting out
                                as privateers, without receiving any satisfactory account. That he
                                then determined to interest the British vice-consul (Mr. Edward
                                    Thornton<note n="*" xml:id="d31fn1">Mr. Thornton was the father
                                    of the present distinguished representative of H. B. M. at
                                    Washington.</note>) in the search; accordingly he opened his
                                busines to that gentleman, who he believes used every endeavor to
                                discover the privateers in question, but without effect. That he
                                (Captain Kilty) then took an actual observation, in the public
                                barge, of all the vessels in the harbor, and remained at length
                                convinced that either those described by the Secretary of War were
                                not there, or that they were not in such a state of preparation for
                                cruising as to make it possible to discover their intention. That he
                                had, however, observed at a wharf on Fell’s Point a schooner
                                mounting twelve guns. Although this vessel, as well from her size as
                                her having come in with the fleet from San Domingo, could not be the
                                Virginia pilot-boat mentioned in the Secretary of War’s letter, yet
                                as she seemed to have been making some equipments, and was evidently
                                intended for a cruise, Captain Kilty thought it proper to make some
                                    <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0416"/>inquiries respecting
                                her. He did so, as far as was consistent with his resolution not to
                                alarm those concerned in her, until he should have put himself in a
                                condition to seize her, if he should find it necessary. The cautious
                                manner in which this consideration obliged him to proceed rendered
                                his intelligence very incomplete. On the whole, however, it appeared
                                that she had added to her number of guns and made some alteration to
                                her waist since her arrival with the fleet, but where the additional
                                cannon were procured he could not learn. Although the regulations on
                                this subject had not then appeared, it occurred to him that military
                                equipments (although partial ones) were not permitted in our ports,
                                and while he was considering whether the circumstances he had
                                discovered would justify him in detaining the vessel, ad had
                                returned to Fell’s Point to make a final observation and inquiry, he
                                learned that an intimation of his design was on its way to her
                                commander. Apprehending, therefore, that she would draw off into the
                                stream, and make a visit to her difficult, if not impracticable, he
                                resolved to get possession while it was in his power, and
                                accordingly desired Mr. Gray-bill, the deputy marshal, to meet him
                                at an appointed hour with a few gentlemen who could be confided in.
                                This being done Captain Kilty went on board and inquired for the
                                captain and other officers, but none of them were there. He then
                                gave the vessel in charge to Mr. Graybill, desiring him to do
                                whatever was necessary to disable her from moving off. He then
                                inquired without reserve respecting the equipments she had made in
                                Baltimore, but could not learn that she had procured guns or done
                                anything that was essential to her as a privateer. That having left
                                the vessel, he was about to return to the town for the purpose of
                                finding the captain, who was said to be there, but was surprised
                                with the appearance of a considerable body of Frenchmen, with a
                                leader and a drum at their head, marching hastily toward the
                                schooner; that being persuaded they intended to retake her, he
                                opposed their progress, and some circumstances of tumult ensued,
                                which at length subsided by these people protesting their ignorance
                                of her having been taken by authority.</p>
                            <p>That the next morning Captain Kilty received a visit from the
                                captain, Jean Baptiste Carvin, who is likewise owner of the
                                schooner, and who with great temper asked the reasons of his vessel
                                having been seized. That, on being informed that the principal
                                ground of the measure was his having enlarged his number of guns, he
                                produced papers signed by the proper officers at San Domingo, by
                                which it appeared that his vessel, called the “Industry/’ has
                                carried guns these three years past, and that on the 11th of April
                                last she mounted sixteen, and had a crew sufficient for
                                privateering. He produced likewise a commission or license for
                                cruising, by which, as he explained it, the prizes went to the
                                government, and the captors received a reasonable gratification.
                                After exhibiting these papers, he asserted that he had procured no
                                guns, or anything of a military nature, except a few spare rammers
                                in Baltimore, but that the guns he appeared to have mounted since
                                his arrival were brought in his hold. He acknowledged the purchase
                                of some cordage and the cleaning the bottom of the vessel, with
                                other things of an indifferent nature, and concluded with demanding
                                if the armed vessels in general in the harbor were not equally
                                liable to detention with his.</p>
                            <p>That, without thinking himself obliged to give entire credit to all
                                these declarations, Captain Kilty still found it impossible to
                                disprove any of them, and, therefore, being satisfied that no
                                representation he should be able to make would induce or authorize
                                the Federal Executive to continue the restriction he had laid on the
                                vessel, but that, on the contrary, heavy damages would be incurred
                                by the public for her detention, he resolved, after he should
                                previously inquire of the French vice-consul respecting the
                                authenticity of the documents exhibited by the captain, to release
                                the vessel. Accordingly, he waited on that officer, who, with great
                                readiness, said much more than was required, and, this ceremony
                                being finished, Captain Kilty directed Mr. Graybill to release the
                                vessel.</p>

                                        vessels, in direct opposition to the laws of neutrality.
                                        Immediately upon this representation the American Government
                                        held that such a fitting out was contrary to the laws of
                                        neutrality, and orders were issued prohibiting the arming of
                                        any French vessels in American ports. At New York a French
                                        vessel fitting out was seized, delivered over to the
                                        tribunals, and condemned. Upon that occasion the American

                                        vessels, was incompatible with the sovereignty of the United

                                vessels left Plymouth ostensibly for Brazil, with six hundred and
                                fifty-two officers and men. The British government of that day,
                                believing that it was destined for Portugal, dispatched a fleet to
                                Terceira, (which, it may be observed, was the place to which the
                                Alabama first went after her departure from England,) with orders,
                                if the expedition appeared, to give them warning against hovering
                                about or making any effort to effect a landing; and, in case of
                                their persistence against the warning, to drive them away from that
                                neighborhood, and to keep sight of them until convinced that they
                                had no intention of returning to the Western Islands or proceeding
                                to Maderia. It became necessary in carrying out these orders to fire
                                upon the expedition. One man was killed, some were wounded, and the
                                expedition was broken up. This act gave rise to an extended debate
                                in Parliament, and the conduct of the government was approved. (<hi

                                affidavits submitted to him, gave his opinion in regard to the
                                Alabama, that it was difficult to make out a stronger case of
                                infringement of the foreign-enlistment act, which, if not enforced
                                on that occasion, was little better than a dead letter; and that it
                                well deserved consideration whether, if the vessel were allowed to
                                escape, the Federal Government would not have a serious ground of
                                remonstrance. (3 <hi rend="italic">Claims, p</hi>. 29.)</p>
                            <p>This opinion was communicated officially to Earl Russell by Mr.

                                solicitor-general in the same administration, in the place of Sir

                                discussed in the House of Commons. In the course of debate the
                                attorney-general said that “the honor and dignity of the Crown are
                                compromised when the subjects of the Queen take part in hostilities
                                against an ally.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Vernon Harcourt said that “no one would differ from Lord
                                Russell’s dictum, that the case of the Alabama was a scandal to the
                                laws of that country, and that those concerned in that disastrous
                                fraud committed one of the most unpatriotic acts of which an
                                Englishman had ever been guilty.” And Sir Roundel Palmer said that
                                    “<hi rend="italic">it was the duty of the state to repress any
                                    attempt on the part of the private citizen to oppose the public

                                arose under the new foreign-enlistment act. In rendering the

                            <p>We have been informed with reference to the demand for
                                indemnification which England makes against Tuscany for the alleged
                                damages which English subjects had suffered in Leghorn, in
                                consequence of the suppression of the revolt which took place in
                                that city in May of 1849. Such a claim, from all points of view, is
                                worthy the attention of the imperial government. In fact, the
                                injuries which gave room for this claim are attributed to the troops
                                of His Majesty the Emperor, which acted as the allies of the
                                legitimate sovereign of Tuscany. On the other hand, independently of
                                this circumstance, it was natural that Austria, united to Tuscany by
                                so many close ties, and by ancient and modern treaties, should lend,
                                and lends, a particular interest to whatever refers to that country.
                                Finally, and it is the point of most importance, the English
                                pretensions tend to raise a question of principle, the solution of
                                which is of the highest importance for the independence and security
                                of all the states which maintain friendly relations with
                                Germany.</p>
                            <p>The origin of the claim goes back to the period in which the city of
                                Leghorn was in full insurrection against the legitimate government.
                                The Austrian troops called to re-establish the authority of the laws
                                were received at the cannon’s mouth; and firing upon them continued
                                from the windows until the city was captured.</p>
                            <p>Our soldiers found themselves obliged to enter by force into
                                warehouses and dwellings in order to ascertain if armed men and
                                munitions of war were uot therein concealed. If, on such an
                                occasion, and in spite of the efforts of our officers to prevent
                                -disorder, there was such disorder; and if some articles belonging
                                to Englishmen were abstracted or destroyed by our soldiers,
                                irritated by the fight and by a blind and tenacious resistance, is
                                there cause for surprise? Ought not that misfortune to be counted
                                among the fatal and inevitable consequences of war?</p>
                            <p>It is under this point of view, sustained besides by the principles
                                of right generally recognized, that the government of the Grand Duke
                                has declared that he is not obliged to concede indemnification to
                                those of his subjects who have suffered losses in consequence of the
                                storming of the city of Leghorn, when it was obliged to surrender,
                                after having refused all conciliatory propositions.</p>
                            <p>In consequence, the government of the Grand Duke of Tuscany has
                                objected to treat the English mare favorably than his own subjects.
                                He has not thought it to be a duty to place the English subjects in
                                a more advantageous position, by paying them in character of
                                indemnity sums which are not paid to Tuscan subjects; the more so,
                                inasmuch as if the foreigners had placed their persons and property
                                in security, they would have been able to escape with ease the
                                general misfortunes to which the inhabitants of a besieged city must
                                submit themselves.</p>
                            <p>These reasons, which the Tuscan government has opposed to the demands
                                of Lord Palmerston, appear to us founded upon principles so high and
                                so unquestionable, that with regret we have seen his excellency
                                persist in such pretensions, notwithstanding the weight of those
                                reasons.</p>
                            <p>So far from desisting, the English embassador receives orders to
                                persist energetically, and to cause to be understood that if the
                                claims were not admitted by the Tuscan government, England would be
                                under the necessity of enforcing them by adopting energetic
                                means.</p>
                            <p>By advice of the English embassador in Florence, Tuscany proposed to
                                submit the matter to the arbitrament of a third power. Even though a
                                mode of procedure had been adopted in this question which would
                                have’ permitted a pacific solution, we cannot conceal that, in the
                                presence of other analogous acts more recent and generally known,
                                the categorical language of the English cabinet <hi rend="italic"

                                    assure to natives</hi>. To place in doubt this <pb n="364"

                                are resolved to maintain firm and unchangeable, and to claim for
                                Englishmen established in a foreign country an exceptional position,
                                would be to force, so to say, the other states to place themselves
                                on guard against the consequences of a pretension so contrary to
                                their independence, because they would impose, even by force, other
                                conditions upon the English subjects whom they consent to
                                receive.</p>
                            <p>We would certainly be the first to adopt that necessary measure,
                                which, it is necessary to confess, would form a notable contrast to
                                the tendency of our epoch to multiply and activate the commercial
                                relations between peoples, and to lessen the distance which
                                separates them.</p>
                            <p>Let this be as it may, the first right of an independent state is to
                                insure its self-preservation by all the means in its power. From the
                                time that a sovereign, availing himself of his right, finds himself
                                obliged to have recourse to arms to suppress <hi rend="italic">an
                                    insurrection, and that in the civil war which results the
                                    property of foreigners established in the country is in
                                    jeopardy, in my view it is a public misfortune, which foreigners
                                    should suffer as well as natives, and which does not entitle
                                    them to exceptional indemnity</hi>, as they neither would have
                                that right if any other calamity should happen proceeding from the
                                will of men.</p>
                            <p>Such is, in its most simple expression, the questionable point
                                suggested to the Tuscan government. We are impressed with the
                                gravity of the consequences which proceed from the question of
                                knowing if the principle treated of ought or ought not to be
                                respected; and for this reason we obey the necessity of submitting
                                it in the most frank manner to the examination of the British
                                government. It belongs to it to weigh the question in its great
                                wisdom and equity, and this will lead, as we hope, to a quick and
                                satisfactory solution of the question which is being discussed.</p>

                                <p>The cabinet of Saint Petersburgh adheres completely to the
                                    principles which have served as the basis to the demand of the
                                    cabinet of Vienna. Russia is too much interested in the
                                    maintenance of the independence of the secondary states and in
                                    the repose of Italy, and for this reason cannot but associate
                                    itself in this case with the sentiments and political views of
                                    Austria.</p>
                                <p>According to the rules of public right, such as they are
                                    understood by Russian policy, it cannot be admitted that a
                                    sovereign, obliged, as was the Grand Duke of Tuscany, <hi
                                        rend="italic">by the obstinacy of his rebellious subjects to
                                        retake a city occupied by the insurgents, should be obliged
                                        to indemnify foreign subjects who may have suffered damages
                                        in consequence of the assault undertaken against that
                                        city.</hi></p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">When a person installs himself in a country
                                        other than his own, he accepts the possibility of all the
                                        dangers to which he may be exposed in that country</hi>.
                                    Leghorn revolted; it was necessary to employ arms to reduce it.
                                    Some English proprietors have participated in the damages
                                    experienced by the native proprietors. Why should they alone
                                    have the right to be indemnified for their losses, when the
                                    Tuscan government does not indemnify its own subjects?</p>
                                <p>These reasons are so clear, that Tuscany, having applied to the
                                    Emperor, asking his arbitrament, the Emperor, notwithstanding
                                    the lively interest which he has for Tuscany, has not been able
                                    to accede to its desire. It is not a question of figures, more
                                    or less in amount, which is treated of, but of a principle,
                                    which his imperial Majesty cannot admit—that is to say, the
                                    principle of any indemnification whatever claimed as a
                                    legitimate right, much less when it is sought to exact it by
                                    force. It would have appeared that he implicitly sanctioned it
                                    had he offered his arbitration to the two parties, supposing
                                    England had consented to adopt the expedient.</p>
                                <p>As Tuscany is disposed to tender conciliatory explanations, it
                                    could not enter into the intentions of the Russian government to
                                    dissuade it from a friendly arrangement with the English
                                    government. But the Emperor hopes, from the justice and
                                    moderation of the English government itself, that it will not,
                                    to obtain it, employ other than conciliatory means also; and the
                                    imperial cabinet ought, in so much as it is concerned, at once
                                    to make its reservations as to all that which it considers as in
                                    small conformity with the recognized maxims of the law of
                                    nations.</p>

                                    means, and if they used them, would have to examine the details
                                    of the operation, estimate the necessity or uselessness of this

                                in prize-cases, the attorney-general, Sir Roundell Palmer, said, in

                                        facts of the case, yet I am not aware of one single decision
                                        pronounced during the war in any one of those courts which
                                        does not bear upon the face of it signs of an honest

                                        Government of the United States, what has indeed been
                                        already stated by my honorable and learned friend, the
                                        attorney-general, that we have no reason to mistrust the
                                        equity and independence of the tribunals of the United
                                        States which have to try questions such as those now under
                                        discussion; and it is but due to the Government of the
                                        United States to say that they have invariably received our
                                        representations in a spirit of respect, equity, and justice.
                                        And in proof of this, to show that, when we had a strong
                                        case of remonstrance, justice has been done to us by the
                                        United States, I need only refer to the case of the Trent,
                                        in which the Government of the United States very handsomely
                                        and properly did justice to the demands we made, and the
                                        rights they did not deny. Therefore, I think it is
                                        prejudicial to the good understanding between the two
                                        governments, which are on good terms, that we should here

                                        guilty, and express mistrust of their equity and fairness
                                        when nothing has occurred to justify us in making these
                                        imputations. I think it only right, in regard to the
                                        tribunals and Government of the United States, to declare
                                        that such accusations are not just, and that nothing has
                                        occurred to warrant them.</p>

                                results from this and from the fifth article of the original treaty,
                                (12 <hi rend="italic">Stat.</hi>, 1232,) that if an American court

                                cruiser, and awards restitution with damages, the British government
                                stands engaged to pay such damages within one year.</p>

                            <p>Since these instructions were given a British blue-book, relating to
                                the “Claims of British subjects against the United States
                                Government, from the commencement of the civil war to the 30th of
                                March, 1864,” which had been reprinted in the diplomatic
                                correspondence, submitted to Congress in the year 1864, (Diplomatic
                                correspondence, 1864, part I, page 736,) has been reprinted in one
                                of the leading journals of the country, with a view undoubtedly of
                                enabling the public to see that most of the claims described in it
                                have been disposed of.</p>
                            <p>An analysis of that document shows the following results:</p>
                            <p>Three hundred and twenty-one cases of the four hundred and fifty
                                therein enumerated have been disposed of.</p>
                            <p>Of these forty-three were cases in which the British government
                                refused to interfere, on the advice of the law officers of the
                                Crown.</p>
                            <p>One hundred and sixty-seven cases have been condemned by the
                                prize-courts of the United States. With the exception of one case,
                                that of the Springbok, the Department of State is not aware of a
                                disposition on the part of the British government to dissent to any
                                final adjudication of the Supreme Court of the United States in a
                                prize-case. The Supreme Court has in several cases reversed
                                condemnations made by the inferior tribunals of prizes, in some of
                                which Congress has made appropriations for the indemnification, of
                                the owners of the property captured.</p>
                            <p>In most of the cases where it is stated that vessels have been
                                condemned, but that appeals are pending, the condemnations by the
                                courts below have been sustained.</p>
                            <p>In sixty-three cases it appears that property taken by the United
                                States has been restored, and that persons imprisoned, or said to
                                have been illegally enlisted, have been released.</p>
                            <p>While the conferences were being held in Washington, a correspondence
                                was going on in England between the foreign office and British
                                subjects residing in France, and preferring claims for the loss of
                                property since the entry of the German army into France. A portion
                                of this correspondence has been published in Blue-Book No. 4, for
                                1871, Franco-German War. The following letters from this publication
                                bear directly upon the questions considered in this portion of the
                                “confidential memorandum.”</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                your lordship’s letter of the 28th instant, in answer to mine of the
                                22d, on the subject of the losses I have sustained by the occupation
                                of my houses in Paris and its neighborhood by French troops during
                                the late war, informing me that your lordship had taken the opinion
                                of the law-officers of the Crown as to the liability of the French
                                government to compensate British subjects resident in France for
                                loss and damage to their property during the late war; and that your
                                lordship had been advised by them that British subjects resident in
                                France would have, in their opinion, no just ground of complaint
                                against the French authorities in the event of their property having
                                been destroyed by the invading armies,</p>
                            <p>I beg to submit to your lordship that my case does not come within
                                the terms of the one submitted to the law-officers of the Crown. At
                                the commencement of the siege of Paris all the inhabitants of
                                Boulogne-sur Seine were ordered by the French government to leave
                                their houses, and my tenant at No. 5 Avenue des Princes, Boulogne
                                sur-Seine, accordingly removed his furniture and gave up possession
                                to the authorities, who occupied the premises for more than five
                                months, with upward of 150 French soldiers, who remained in it until
                                the signature of the treaty of peace, and then left it in the most
                                ruinous conditon. The German troops passed one night on the premises
                                after the temporary occupation of Paris, but did no additional
                                damage to the property. My other houses within the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >enceinte</hi> of Paris were occupied wholly by French troops
                                and French peasants. “No destruction of property by invading armies”
                                consequently took place in my case.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion, my claim is similar to that made by your lordship on
                                the German Government for the loss sustained by British ship-owners
                                whose vessels were seized and sunk near Rouen. In the one case ships
                                were seized and destroyed by the German authorities; and, in the
                                other, houses were seized and destroyed by the French authorities,
                                both belonging to British subjects, and demanding similar
                                compensation.</p>
                            <p>I have now, therefore, to beg that your lordship will be so good as
                                to forward my claim on the French government to Lord Lyons, with a
                                request that his excellency will give me such assistance as may be
                                required in his capacity of English ambassador, in order to induce
                                the French government to entertain my claim when the proper time
                                shall arrive for submitting it to the authorities. I beg, however,
                                to add that I am informed that, by the law of France, compensation
                                is due not only to foreigners, but to French subjects for injury
                                done to their property by invading armies, and for the occupation of
                                their houses by French troops, and for damages resulting therefrom.
                                I trust, therefore, that it will not be necessary to call for Lord
                                Lyons’s intervention.</p>
                            <p>I have thought it my duty to trouble your lordship with this letter,
                                    <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0428"/>in order that I may
                                point out the difference between my case and that submitted to the
                                law-officers of the Crown, and I may add that I think it will be
                                found that few British subjects are in the same position as I am
                                with respect to my French property.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am directed by Earl Granville to
                                acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which,
                                with reference to the answer which Lord Granville caused to be
                                returned to your letter of the 22d of March, respecting the losses
                                which you state you have sustained by the occupation of your houses
                                in Paris and the neighborhood by French troops during the war, you
                                now submit that your case does not come within the terms of that
                                which had been submitted to the law-officers of the Crown, and upon
                                whose opinion with reference thereto the answer to your
                                representation had been founded, inasmuch as there was “no
                                destruction of property by invading armies,” but that the damage was
                                caused in consequence of the occupation of your property by French
                                troops, which property had been vacated by orders of the French
                                authorities themselves.</p>
                            <p>I am now to state to you that Lord Granville has taken the opinion of
                                the law-officers upon your further application, and I am to observe
                                that Her Majesty’s subjects resident in France cannot of right claim
                                to be in a better position in respect to their immovable property in
                                France than French subjects, and that, if you have been correctly
                                informed as to the law of France, the intervention of Her Majesty’s
                                government will not be required to enable you to prefer a claim
                                before the French authorities to compensation for any losses
                                resulting to you from the occupation of your houses by French
                                troops. But whether you have been correctly informed or not, Her
                                Majesty’s government cannot intervene, if you receive at the bands
                                of the French government the same treatment which French subjects
                                themselves receive.</p>
                            <p>With regard to your allusion to the case of the British ships which
                                have sunk at Rouen, I am to observe that there is no analogy between
                                ships and immovable property.</p>

                                <p>Another pertinent case has recently been decided by the British
                                    government against a claimant. Mr. Worth, a British subject,
                                    claimed indemnity on account of imprisonment to which he was
                                    subjected by the German authorities on his capture, in an
                                    attempt to escape from Paris in a balloon.</p>
                                <p>Lord Enfield, in a note of the 3d of April, informs Mr. Worth
                                    that Lord Granville regrets that, “<hi rend="italic">after

                            <p>On the termination of the reciprocity treaty of the 5th of June,
                                1854, by the United States Government, the discussions respecting
                                the rights of American fishermen under Article I of the convention
                                of the 20th of October, 1818, which had been set at rest by the
                                reciprocity treaty, were revived, and, although temporary measures
                                were taken to avoid pressing with severity upon American fishermen
                                by the adoption of a <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0432"/>system
                                of licenses, it has been found impracticable to continue that system
                                indefinitely, and, on its withdrawal, much excitement has been
                                occasioned among the coast population of the Eastern States of the
                                Union by the capture of boats engaged in illegal fishing, contrary
                                to the convention of 1818.</p>
                            <p>The correspondence will put you in possession of the facts of the
                                several captures, and enable you to judge, and explain, if
                                necessary, how far the pretensions of the American fishermen are
                                exaggerated, and the leniency with which they have been treated
                                under the directions of Her Majesty’s government and of the
                                government of the Dominion by the officers charged with the
                                protection of the British fisheries.</p>
                            <p>Irrespective, however, of the captures and confiscations of boats
                                during the recent fishing season, there are, and have been for many
                                years, differences of interpretation put upon the convention of 1818
                                by the respective governments, which might, at any time, rise into
                                serious importance.</p>
                            <p>The two chief questions are: As to whether the expression “three
                                marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of His
                                Britannic Majesty’s dominions “should be taken to mean a limit of
                                three miles from the coast line, or a limit of three miles from a
                                line drawn from headland to headland and whether the proviso that
                                “the American fishermen shall be admitted to enter such bays or
                                harbors for the purpose of shelter, and of repairing damages
                                therein, of purchasing wood, and of obtaining water, and for no
                                other purpose whatever, is intended to exclude American vessels from
                                coming inshore to traffic, transship fish, purchase stores, hire
                                seamen, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government would be glad to learn that you were able to
                                arrive at a conclusive understanding with the commissioners of the
                                United States upon the disputed interpretation of the convention of
                                1818; but they fear that you will find it expedient that a
                                settlement should be arrived at by some other means, in which case
                                they will be prepared for the whole question of the relations
                                between the United States and the British possessions in North
                                America, as regards the fisheries, being referred for consideration
                                and inquiry to an international commission, on which two
                                commissioners, to be hereafter appointed, in consultation with the
                                government of the Dominion, should be the British
                                representatives.</p>
                            <p>Should the Government of the United States concur in this, it would
                                be advisable that no time should be lost in appointing commissioners
                                on their side, and in the commission commencing its labors; and, as
                                it is scarcely probable that the commissioners will be able to
                                report, and a treaty be framed, before the commencement of the next
                                fishing season, it would be also desirable that you should agree
                                upon some means, by license or otherwise, by which disputes may be
                                avoided in the meanwhile.</p>

                            <p>The President of the United States, in his message at the opening of
                                Congress in December last, referred to the claim of free navigation
                                of the river Saint Lawrence as being an occasion of difference
                                between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>The fourth article of the reciprocity treaty provided that the
                                citizens and inhabitants of the United States should be allowed to
                                navigate the river Saint Lawrence and the canals of Canada; and Her
                                Majesty’s government <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0433"/>are
                                not aware that any practical difficulty as to the free navigation of
                                the Saint Lawrence has arisen since the abrogation of that
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>The exclusive right to the navigation of the Saint Lawrence was
                                maintained by this country throughout the discussions between the
                                two governments on the subject in 1824–’27, and has been
                                acknowledged as existing by this article of the reciprocity treaty,
                                under which the British government retained the right of suspending
                                the privilege.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s Government are, nevertheless, now willing to admit the
                                principle of the navigation of the Saint Lawrence being free to the
                                citizens of the United States, subject to such tolls and regulations
                                as may be imposed equally on British subjects.</p>
                            <p>This, however, cannot extend, except as a special privilege to the
                                passage through the canals constructed by Canadian enterprise
                                through British territory, without which, from the strength of the
                                current and dangerous rapids, the navigation of the Saint Lawrence
                                cannot be profitably conducted; and the best course will probably be
                                found to be to refer these questions for detailed examination and
                                mutual arrangement in relation to the transit of goods in bond
                                through Maine, Saint John River lumber trade, navigation of Lake
                                Michigan, passage through the canals in United States territory, and
                                other similar matters, to the commission to be appointed to consider
                                and report upon the fisheries.</p>

                            <p>The President has already intimated to Congress that he is of opinion
                                that the survey of the boundary along the forty-ninth parallel,
                                which has only been carried out across the Rocky Mountains to the
                                Gulf of Georgia, should be completed from the Lake of the Woods to
                                the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                            <p>In this Her Majesty’s government concur, and will be ready to appoint
                                a commission for the purpose whenever the United States Government
                                think fit.</p>

                                    claims.</hi></p>
                            <p>Under this head are comprised the claims against Great Britain for
                                damages sustained by the depredations of the, Alabama, Shenandoah,
                                and Georgia, the vessels which were furnished on account of the
                                so-styled Confederate States and armed outside of British
                                jurisdiction, and of the Florida, which, though built in England,
                                was armed and equipped in the port of Mobile.</p>
                            <p>The history of these vessels is so fully explained in the long
                                correspondence which has taken place with regard to them, that it is
                                unnecessary for me now to do more than point out that the claims
                                which have been preferred on account of the Alabama stand on a
                                different footing to those arising from the captures made by the
                                other cruisers; in so far as the Alabama escaped from Liverpool
                                after evidence had been supplied by the United States minister of
                                the service for which she was intended.</p>

                                the settlement of these claims, which was recognized and adopted in
                                the convention signed by Lord Clarendon and Mr. Reverdy Johnson as
                                being, in their opinion, the most appropriate mode of settling this
                                question and, should arbitration be adopted, Her Majesty’s
                                government would concur, if the United States Government proposed
                                it, in jurists <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0434"/>properly

                                as provided in the late convention.</p>
                            <p>Although, however, Her Majesty’s government are of opinion that
                                arbitration is the most appropriate mode of settlement, you are at

                                may be suggested for determining and closing the question of these

                                position hitherto maintained by Her Majesty’s government as to the
                                international obligations of neutral nations.</p>

                                appointed for its demarkation differed, was proposed by Lord Russell
                                as a fit subject for arbitration in 1859; but, owing to the civil
                                war, the negotiations then instituted were not brought to a

                                having been in the first instance included in the same negotiation
                                under the protocol of the 10th of November, 1868, upon which the
                                treaty of the 14th of January, 1869, was framed.</p>
                            <p>The naturalization treaty having been ratified some months ago, Her

                                will no longer hesitate to act upon the water-boundary treaty, which
                                should in that case be appended to and form part of the general
                                treaty for the mode of settlement of all outstanding differences
                                which you are empowered to sign.</p>
                            <p>Should, however, a form of arbitration admitting of more free

                            <p>It would be desirable to take this opportunity to consider whether it
                                might not be the interest of both Great Britain and the United

                                to the obligations of maritime neutrality, not only to be
                                acknowledged for observance in their future relations, but to be
                                recommended for adoption to the other maritime powers.</p>
                            <p>I have thus touched briefly upon the subjects likely, principally, to
                                engage your attention, and have indicated the manner in which they

                                precisely defined in the present stage of the controversy; but there
                                are other points in which it may be convenient to you to be informed

                            <p>That no vessel employed in the military or naval service of any

                                dispatched contrary to the neutrality of neutral state should be

                                violation of the neutrality of any state, should, if brought within
                                the jurisdiction of that state, be restored.</p>
                            <p>That, in time of war, no vessel should be recognized as a ship of

                                        February, in the year of Our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred
                                        and Seventy-One, and in the Thirty-Fourth Year of our

                            <p>It was proposed by the British High Commissioners that Mr. Fish,
                                Secretary of State of the United States, should preside.</p>
                            <p>The United States Commissioner stated that, although appreciating the
                                proposal, they did not consider it necessary that a president should
                                be named.</p>
                            <p>The High Commissioners, on the suggestion of Mr. Fish, requested Lord
                                Tenterden, Secretary to the British High Commission, and Mr.
                                Bancroft Davis, Assistant Secretary of State of the United States,
                                acting as secretary to the United States High Commission, to
                                undertake the duties of joint protocolists.</p>
                            <p>The High Commissioners then agreed that the subjects for discussion
                                should be those mentioned in the following correspondence which had
                                taken place between the two Governments.</p>

                                which I have received from Earl Granville, I have the honor to state
                                that Her Majesty’s Government deem it of importance to the good
                                relations which they are ever anxious should subsist and be
                                strengthened between the United States and Great Britain, that a
                                friendly and complete understanding should be come to between the
                                two Governments as to the extent of the rights which belong to the
                                citizens of the United States and Her Majesty’s subjects,
                                respectively, with reference to the fisheries on the coasts of Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America, and as to any other
                                questions between them which affect the relations of the United
                                States toward those possessions.</p>
                            <p>As the consideration of these matters would, however, involve
                                investigations of a somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very
                                desirable that they should be thoroughly examined, I am directed by
                                Lord Granville to propose to the Government of the United States the
                                appointment of a Joint High Commission, which shall be composed of
                                members to be named by each Government; shall hold its sessions at
                                Washington, and shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the
                                different questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well
                                as all those which affect the relations of the United States toward
                                Her Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I am confident that this proposal will be met by your Government in
                                the same cordial spirit of friendship which has induced Her
                                Majesty’s Government to tender it and I cannot doubt that in that
                                case the result will not fail to contribute to the maintenance of
                                the good relations between the two countries, which I am convinced
                                the Government of the United States, as well as that of Her Majesty,
                                equally have at heart.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your
                                most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your note of January 26, in which you inform me, in
                                compliance with instructions from Earl Granville, that Her Majesty’s
                                Government deem it of importance to the good relations which they
                                are ever anxious should subsist and be strengthened between the
                                United States and Great Britain, that a friendly and complete
                                understanding should be come to between the two Governments as to
                                the extent of the rights which belong to the citizens of the United
                                States and Her Majesty’s subjects, respectively, with reference to
                                the fisheries on the coasts of Her Majesty’s possessions in North
                                America, and as to any other questions between them which affect the
                                relations of the United States toward those possesions; and further,
                                that as the consideration of these questions would involve
                                investigations of a somewhat complicated nature, and as it is very
                                desirable that they should be thoroughly examined, you are directed
                                by <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0442"/>Lord Granville to
                                propose to the Government of the United States the appointment of a
                                Joint High Commission, which shall be composed of members to be
                                named by each Government; shall hold its sessions at Washington, and
                                shall treat of and discuss the mode of settling the different
                                questions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well as all
                                those which affect the relations of the United States toward Her
                                Majesty’s possessions in North America.</p>
                            <p>I have laid your note before the President, who instructs me to say
                                that he shares with Her Majesty’s Government the appreciation of the
                                importance of a friendly and complete understanding between the two
                                Governments with reference to the subjects specially suggested for
                                the consideration of the proposed Joint High Commission, and he
                                fully recognizes the friendly spirit which has prompted the
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>The President is, however, of the opinion that, without the
                                adjustment of a class of questions not alluded to in your note, the
                                proposed High Commission would fail to establish the permanent
                                relations and the sincere, substantial, and lasting friendship
                                between the two Governments which, in common with Her Majesty’s
                                Government, he desires should prevail.</p>
                            <p>He thinks that the removal of the differences which arose during the
                                rebellion in the United States, and which have existed since then,
                                growing out of the acts committed by the several vessels which have
                                given rise to the claims generically known as the “Alabama” claims,
                                will also be essential to the restoration of cordial and amicable
                                relations between the two Governments. He directs me to say that
                                should Her Majesty’s Government accept this view of the matter, and
                                assent that this subject also may be treated of by the proposed High
                                Commission, and may thus be put in the way of a final and amicable
                                settlement, this Government will, with much pleasure, appoint High
                                Commissioners on the part of the United States, to meet those who
                                may be appointed on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, and will
                                spare no efforts to secure, at the earliest practical moment, a just
                                and amicable arrangement of all the questions which now
                                unfortunately stand in the way of an entire and abiding friendship
                                between the two nations.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your

                            <p>I am now authorized by His Lordship to state that it would give Her
                                Majesty’s Government great satisfaction if the claims commonly known
                                by the name of the “Alabama” claims were submitted to the
                                consideration of the same High Commission by which Her Majesty’s
                                Government have proposed that the questions relating to the British
                                possessions in North America should be discussed, provided that all

                                this country, are similarly referred to the same Commission. The
                                expressions made use of in the name of the President in your
                                above-mentioned note, with regard to the “Alabama” claims, convince
                                me that the Government of the United States will consider it of
                                importance that these causes of disputes between the two countries
                                should also, and at the same time, be done away with, and that you
                                will enable me to convey to my Government the assent of the
                                President to the addition which they thus propose to the duties of
                                the High Commission, and which cannot fail to make it more certain
                                that its labors will lead to the removal of all differences between

                                showed extensive direct losses in the capture and destruction of a
                                large number of vessels with their cargoes, and in the heavy
                                national expenditures in the pursuit of the cruisers, and indirect
                                injury in the transfer of a large part of the American commercial
                                marine to the British flag, in the enhanced payments of insurance,
                                in the prolongation of the war, and in the addition of a large sum
                                to the cost of the war and the suppression of the rebellion; and
                                also showed that Great Britain, by reason of failure in the proper
                                observance of her duties as a neutral, had become justly liable for
                                the acts of those cruisers and of their tenders; that the claims for
                                the loss and destruction of private property which had thus far been
                                presented amounted to about fourteen millions of dollars, without
                                interest, which amount was liable to be greatly increased by claims
                                which had not been presented; that the cost to which the Government
                                had been put in the pursuit of cruisers could easily be ascertained
                                by certificates of Government accounting officers; that in the hope
                                of an amicable settlement no estimate was made of the indirect
                                losses, without prejudice, however, to the right to indemnification
                                on their account in the event of no such settlement being made.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners further stated that they hoped that the
                                British Commissioners would be able to place upon record an
                                expression of regret by Her Majesty’s Government for the
                                depredations committed by the vessels whose acts were now under
                                discussion. They also proposed that the Joint High Commission should
                                agree upon a sum which should be paid by Great Britain to the United
                                States, in satisfaction of all the claims and the interest
                                thereon.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that Her Majesty’s Government could
                                not admit that Great Britain had failed to discharge toward the
                                United States the duties imposed on her by the rules of
                                International Law, or that she was justly liable to make good to the
                                United States the losses occasioned by the acts of the cruisers to
                                which the American Commissioners had referred. They reminded the
                                American Commissioners that several vessels, suspected of being
                                designed to cruise against the United States, including two
                                ironclads, had been arrested or detained by the British Government,
                                and that that Government had in some instances not confined itself
                                to the discharge of international obligations, however widely
                                construed, as, for instance, when it acquired at <pb n="397"
                                    xml:id="pg_397" facs="0455"/>a great cost to the country the
                                control of the Anglo-Chinese Flotilla, which, it was apprehended,
                                might be used against the United States.</p>
                            <p>They added that although Great Britain had, from the beginning,
                                disavowed any responsibility for the acts of the Alabama and the
                                other vessels, she had already shown her willingness, for the sake
                                of the maintenance of friendly relations with the United States, to
                                adopt the principle of arbitration, provided that a fitting
                                Arbitrator could be found, and that an agreement could be come to as
                                to the points to which arbitration should apply. They would,
                                therefore, abstain from replying in detail to the statement of the
                                American Commissioners, in the hope that the necessity for entering
                                upon a lengthened controversy might be obviated by the adoption of
                                so fair a mode of settlement as that which they were instructed to
                                propose; and they had now to repeat, on behalf of their Government,
                                the offer of arbitration.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners expressed their regret at this decision of
                                the British Commissioners, and said further that they could not
                                consent to submit the question of the liability of Her Majesty’s
                                Government to arbitration unless the principles which should govern
                                the Arbitrator in the consideration of the facts could be first
                                agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that they had no authority to agree
                                to a submission of these claims to an Arbitrator with instructions
                                as to the principles which should govern him in the consideration of
                                them. They said that they should be willing to consider what
                                principles should be adopted for observance in future; but that they
                                were of opinion that the best mode of conducting an arbitration was
                                to submit the facts to the Arbitrator, and leave him free to decide
                                upon them after hearing such arguments as might be necessary.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were willing to consider
                                what principles should be laid down for observance in similar cases
                                in future, with the understanding that any principles that should be
                                agreed upon should be held to be applicable to the facts in respect
                                to the Alabama Claims.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that they could not admit that
                                there had been any violation of existing principles of International
                                Law, and that their instructions did not authorize them to accede to
                                a proposal for laying down rules for the guidance of the Arbitrator,
                                but that they would make known to their Government the views of the
                                American Commissioners on the subject.</p>
                            <p>At the respective conferences on March 9, March 10, March 13, and
                                March 14, the Joint High Commission considered the form of the
                                declaration of principles or rules which the American Commissioners
                                desired to see adopted for the instruction of the Arbitrator and
                                laid down for observance by the two Governments in future.</p>
                            <p>At the close of the conference of the 14th of March the British
                                Commissioners reserved several questions for the consideration of
                                their Government.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 5th of April the British Commissioners
                                stated that they were instructed by Her Majesty’s Government to
                                declare that Her Majesty’s Government could not assent to the
                                proposed rules as a statement of principles of International Law
                                which were in force at the time when the Alabama Claims arose, but
                                that Her Majesty’s Government, in order to evince its desire of
                                strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries and
                                of making satisfactory provision for the future, agreed that in
                                deciding the questions between the two countries arising out of
                                those claims, the Arbitrator should assume that Her Majesty’s
                                Government had undertaken to act upon the <pb n="398"
                                    xml:id="pg_398" facs="0456"/>principles set forth in the rules
                                which the American Commissioners had proposed, viz:</p>
                            <p>That a neutral Government is hound, first, to use due diligence to
                                prevent the fitting out, arming, or equipping, within its
                                jurisdiction, of any vessel which it has reasonable ground to
                                believe is intended to cruise or carry on war against a power with
                                which it is at peace; and also to use like diligence to prevent the
                                departure from its jurisdiction of any vessel intended to cruise or
                                carry on war as above, such vessel having been specially adapted, in
                                whole or in part, within such jurisdiction, to warlike use.</p>
                            <list>
                                <item>Secondly. Not to permit of suffer either belligerent to make
                                    use of its ports or waters as the base of naval operations
                                    against the other, or for the purpose of the renewal or
                                    augmentation of military supplies or arms, or the recruitment of
                                    men.</item>
                                <item>Thirdly. To exercise due diligence in its own ports or waters,
                                    and as to all persons within its jurisdiction, to prevent any
                                    violation of the foregoing obligations and duties.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>It being a condition of this undertaking, that these obligations
                                should in future be held to be binding internationally between the
                                two countries.</p>
                            <p>It was also settled that in deciding the matters submitted to him the
                                Arbitrator should be governed by the foregoing rules, which had been
                                agreed upon as rules to be taken as applicable to the case, and by
                                such principles of International Law, not inconsistent therewith, as
                                the Arbitrator should determine to have been applicable to the
                                case.</p>
                            <p>The Joint High Commission then proceeded to consider the form of
                                submission and the manner of constituting a tribunal of
                                arbitration.</p>
                            <p>At the conferences on the 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th of April the
                                Joint High Commission considered and discussed the form of
                                submission, the manner of the award, and the mode of selecting the
                                Arbitrators.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners, referring to the hope which they had
                                expressed on the 8th of March, inquired whether the British
                                Commissioners were prepared to place upon record an expression of
                                regret by Her Majesty’s Government for the depredations committed by
                                the vessels whose acts were now under discussion; and the British
                                Commissioners replied that they were authorized to express, in a
                                friendly spirit, the regret felt by Her Majesty’s Government for the
                                escape, under whatever circumstances, of the Alabama and other
                                vessels from British ports, and for the depredations committed by
                                those vessels.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners accepted this expression of regret as very
                                satisfactory to them and as a token of kindness, and said that they
                                felt sure it would be so received by the Government and people of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>In the conference on the 13th of April the Treaty Articles I to XI
                                were agreed to.</p>
                            <p rend="center">
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XII to XVII.</hi>

                            <p>At the conference on the 4th of March it was agreed to consider the
                                subjects referred to the Joint High Commission by the respective
                                Governments in the order in which they appeared in the
                                correspondence between Sir Edward Thornton and Mr. Fish, and to
                                defer the consideration of the adjustment of “all other claims, both
                                of British subjects and citizens of the United States, arising out
                                of acts committed during the recent civil war in this country,’’ as
                                described by Sir Edward Thornton <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399"
                                    facs="0457"/>in his letter of February 1, until the subjects
                                referred to in the previous letters should have been disposed
                                of.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners said that they supposed that they were
                                right in their opinion that British laws prohibit British subjects
                                from owning slaves; they therefore inquired whether any claims for
                                slaves, or for alleged property or interest in slaves, can or will
                                be presented by the British Government, or in behalf of any British
                                subject, under the Treaty now being negotiated, if there be in the
                                Treaty no express words excluding such claims.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that by the law of England British
                                subjects had long been prohibited from purchasing or dealing in
                                slaves, not only within the dominions of the British Crown but in
                                any foreign country; and that they had no hesitation in saying that
                                no claim on behalf of any British subject, for slaves or for any
                                property or interest in slaves, would be presented by the British
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the paragraph in Sir Edward Thornton’s letter of January
                                26, relating to “the mode of settling the different questions which
                                have arisen out of the Fisheries, as well as all those which affect
                                the relations of the United States towards Her Majesty’s Possessions
                                in North America,” the British Commissioners proposed that the Joint
                                High Commission should consider the claims for injuries which the
                                people of Canada had suffered from what were known as the Fenian
                                raids.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners objected to this, and it was agreed that
                                the subject might be brought up again by the British Commissioners
                                in connection with the subject referred to by Sir Edward Thornton in
                                his letter of February 1.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 14th of April the Joint High Commission took
                                into consideration the subjects mentioned by Sir Edward Thornton in
                                that letter.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners proposed that a Commission for the
                                consideration of these claims should be appointed, and that the
                                Convention of 1853 should be followed as a precedent. This was
                                agreed to, except that it was settled that there should be a third
                                Commissioner instead of an Umpire.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 15th of April the Treaty Articles XII to
                                XVII were agreed to.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 26th of April the British Commissioners
                                again brought before the Joint High Commission the claims of the
                                people of Canada for injuries suffered from the Fenian raids. They
                                said that they were instructed to present these claims and to state
                                that they were regarded by Her Majesty’s Government as coming within
                                the class of subjects indicated by Sir Edward Thornton in his letter
                                of January 26, as subjects for the consideration of the Joint High
                                Commission.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were instructed to say
                                that the Government of the United States did not regard these claims
                                as coming within the class of subjects indicated in that letter as
                                subjects for the consideration of the Joint High Commission, and
                                that they were without any authority from their Government to
                                consider them. They therefore declined to do so.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners stated that, as the subject was understood
                                not to be within the scope of the instructions of the American
                                Commissioners, they must refer to their Government for further
                                instructions upon it.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 3d of May the British Commissioners stated
                                that they were instructed by their Government to express their
                                regret that the American Commissioners were without authority to
                                deal with <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0458"/>the question of
                                the Fenian raids, and they inquired whether that was still the
                                case.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that they could see no reason to
                                vary the reply formerly given to this proposal; that in their view
                                the subject was not embraced in the scope of the correspondence
                                between Sir Edward Thornton and Mr. Fish under either of the letters
                                of the former; and that they did not feel justified in entering upon
                                the consideration of any class of claims not contemplated at the
                                time of the creation of the present Commission, and that the claims
                                now referred to did not commend themselves to their favor.</p>
                            <p>The British High Commissioners said that under these circumstances
                                they would not urge further that the settlement of these claims
                                should be included in the present treaty, and that they had the less
                                difficulty in doing so, as a portion of the claims were of a
                                constructive and inferential character.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XVIII to XXV</hi>.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 6th of March the British Commissioners
                                stated that they were prepared to discuss the question of the
                                Fisheries, either in detail or generally, so as either to enter into
                                an examination of the respective rights of the two countries under
                                the Treaty of 1818 and the general law of nations, or to approach at
                                once the settlement of the question on a comprehensive basis.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners said that with the view of avoiding the
                                discussion of matters which subsequent negotiation might render it
                                unnecessary to enter into, they thought it would be preferable to
                                adopt the latter course, and inquired what, in that case, would be
                                the basis which the British Commissioners desired to propose.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that they considered that the
                                Reciprocity Treaty of June 5, 1854, should be restored in
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners declined to assent to a renewal of the
                                former reciprocity treaty.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners then suggested that, if any considerable
                                modification were made in the tariff arrangements of that Treaty,
                                the coasting trade of the United States and of Her Britannic
                                Majesty’s Possessions in North America should be reciprocally thrown
                                open, and that the navigation of the River Saint Lawrence and of the
                                Canadian Canals should be also thrown open to the citizens of the
                                United States on terms of equality with British subjects.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners declined this proposal, and objected to a
                                negotiation on the basis of the Reciprocity Treaty. They said that
                                that Treaty had proved unsatisfactory to the people of the United
                                States, and consequently had been terminated by notice from the
                                Government of the United States, in pursuance of its provisions. Its
                                renewal was not in their interest, and would not be in accordance
                                with the sentiments of their people. They further said that they
                                were not at liberty to treat of the opening of the coasting trade of
                                the United States to the subjects of Her Majesty residing in her
                                Possessions in North America, It was agreed that the questions
                                relating to the navigation of the River Saint Lawrence, and of the
                                Canadian Canals, and to other commercial questions affecting Canada,
                                should be treated by themselves.</p>
                            <p>The subject of the Fisheries was further discussed at the conferences
                                on the 7th, 20th, 22d, and 25th of March. The American Commissioners
                                stated that if the value of the inshore fisheries could be
                                ascertained, the United States might prefer to purchase, for a sum
                                of money, the right <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0459"/>to
                                enjoy, in perpetuity, the use of these inshore fisheries in common
                                with British fishermen, and mentioned one million dollars as the sum
                                they were prepared to offer. The British Commissioners replied that
                                this offer was, they thought, wholly inadequate, and that no
                                arrangement would be acceptable of which the admission into the
                                United States free of duty of fish, the produce of the British
                                fisheries, did not form a part, adding that any arrangement for the
                                acquisition by purchase of the inshore fisheries in perpetuity was
                                open to grave objection.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners inquired whether it would be necessary to
                                refer any arrangement for purchase to the Colonial or Provincial
                                Parliament.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners explained that the Fisheries within the
                                limits of maritime jurisdiction were the property of the several
                                British Colonies, and that it would be necessary to refer any
                                arrangement which might affect Colonial property or rights to the
                                Colonial or Provincial Parliament; and that legislation would also
                                be required on the part of the Imperial Parliament.</p>
                            <p>During these discussions the British Commissioners contended that
                                these inshore fisheries were of great value, and that the most
                                satisfactory arrangement for their use would be a reciprocal tariff
                                arrangement, and reciprocity in the coasting trade; and the American
                                Commissioners replied that their value was overestimated; that the
                                United States desired to secure their enjoyment, not for their
                                commercial or intrinsic value, but for the purpose of removing a
                                source of irritation; and that they could hold out no hope that the
                                Congress of the United States would give its assent to such a tariff
                                arrangement as was proposed, or to any extended plan of reciprocal
                                free admission of the products of the two countries; but that,
                                inasmuch as one branch of Congress had recently, more than once,
                                expressed itself in favor of the abolition of duties on coal and
                                salt, they would propose that coal, salt, and fish be reciprocally
                                admitted free; and, that, inasmuch as Congress had removed the duty
                                from a portion of the lumber heretofore subject to duty, and as the
                                tendency of legislation in the United States was toward the
                                reduction of taxation and of duties in proportion to the reduction
                                of the public debt and expenses, they would further propose that
                                lumber be admitted free from duty from and after the first of July,
                                1874, subject to the approval of Congress, which was necessary on
                                all questions affecting import duties.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners, at the conference on the 17th of April,
                                stated that they had referred this offer to their Government, and
                                were instructed to inform the American Commissioners that it was
                                regarded as inadequate, and that Her Majesty’s Government considered
                                that free lumber should be granted at once, and that the proposed
                                tariff concessions should be supplemented by a money payment.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners then stated that they withdrew the
                                proposal which they had previously made of the reciprocal free
                                admission of coal, salt, and fish, and of lumber after July 1, 1874;
                                that that proposal had been made entirely in the interest of a
                                peaceful settlement, and for the purpose of removing a source of
                                irritation and of anxiety; that its value had been beyond the
                                commercial or intrinsic value of the rights to have been acquired in
                                return; and that they could not consent to an arrangement on the
                                basis now proposed by the British Commissioners; and they renewed
                                their proposal to pay a money equivalent for the use of the inshore
                                fisheries. They further proposed that, in case the two Governments
                                should not be able to agree upon the sum to be paid as such an
                                equivalent, the matter should be referred to an impartial Commission
                                for determination.</p>
                            <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0460"/>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that this proposal was one on which
                                they had no instructions, and that it would not be possible for them
                                to come to any arrangement except one for a term of years and
                                involving the concession of free fish and fish-oil by the American
                                Commissioners; but that if free fish and fish-oil were conceded,
                                they would inquire of their Government whether they were prepared to
                                assent to a reference to arbitration as to money payment.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were willing, subject to
                                the action of Congress, to concede free fish and fish-oil as an
                                equivalent for the use of the inshore fisheries, and to make the
                                arrangement for a term of years; that they were of the opinion that
                                free fish and fish-oil would be more than an equivalent for those
                                fisheries, but that they were also willing to agree to a reference
                                to determine that question and the amount of any money payment that
                                might be found necesssary to complete an equivalent, it being
                                understood that legislation would be needed before any payment could
                                be made.</p>
                            <p>The subject was further discussed in the conferences of April 18 and
                                19, and the British Commissioners having referred the last proposal
                                to their Government and received instructions to accept it, the
                                Treaty Articles XVIII to XXV were agreed to at the conference on the
                                22d of April.</p>

                            <p>At the conference on the 6th of March the British Commissioners
                                proposed that the Reciprocity Treaty of June 5, 1854, should be
                                restored in principle, and that, if any considerable modifications
                                in the tariff arrangements in force under it were made, the coasting
                                trade of the United States and of Her Britannic Majesty’s
                                Possessions in North America should be reciprocally thrown open, and
                                that the navigation of the River St. Lawrence and of the Canadian
                                Canals should be thrown open to the citizens of the United States on
                                terms of equality with British subjects.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners declined this proposal, and in the
                                subsequent negotiations the question of the Fisheries was treated by
                                itself.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 17th of March the Joint High Commission
                                considered the subject of the American improvement of the navigation
                                of the Saint Clair Flats.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 18th of March the questions of the
                                navigation of the River Saint Lawrence and the Canals and the other
                                subjects connected therewith were taken up.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners proposed to take into consideration the
                                question of transit of goods in bond through Canada and the United
                                States, which was agreed to.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners proposed to take into consideration the
                                question of opening the coasting trade of the lakes reciprocally to
                                each party, which was declined.</p>
                            <p>On the proposal of the British Commissioners it was agreed to take
                                the question of transshipment into consideration.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners proposed to take into consideration the
                                reciprocal registration of vessels, as between the Dominion of
                                Canada and the United States, which was declined.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 23d of March the transshipment question was
                                discussed, and postponed for further information, on the motion of
                                the American Commissioners.</p>
                            <p>The transit question was discussed, and it was agreed that any
                                settlement <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0461"/>that might be
                                made should include a reciprocal arrangement in that respect for the
                                period for which the Fishery articles should be in force.</p>
                            <p>The question of the navigation of the River Saint Lawrence and the
                                Canals was taken up.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners stated that they regarded the concession of
                                the navigation of Lake Michigan as an equivalent for the concession
                                of the navigation of the River Saint Lawrence.</p>
                            <p>As to the Canals, they stated that the concession of the privilege to
                                navigate them in their present condition, on terms of equality with
                                British subjects, was a much greater concession than the
                                corresponding use of the Canals offered by the United States.</p>
                            <p>They further said that the enlargement of the Canals would involve
                                the expenditure of a large amount of money, and they asked what
                                equivalent the American Commissioners proposed to give for the
                                surrender of the right to control the tolls for the use of the
                                Canals, either in their present state or after enlargement.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied, that unless the Well and Canal
                                should be enlarged so as to accommodate the present course of trade,
                                they should not be disposed to make any concessions; that in their
                                opinion the citizens of the United States could now justly claim to
                                navigate the River St. Lawrence in its natural state, ascending and
                                descending, from the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude, where
                                it ceases to form the boundary between the two countries, from, to,
                                and into the sea; and they could not concede that the navigation of
                                Lake Michigan should be given or taken as an equivalent for that
                                right; and they thought that the concession of the navigation of
                                Lake Michigan and of the Canals offered by them was more than an
                                equivalent for the concessions as to the Canadian Canals which were
                                asked. They proposed, in connection with a reciprocal arrangement as
                                to transit and transshipment, that Canada should agree to enlarge
                                the Welland and St. Lawrence Canals, to make no discriminating
                                tolls, and to limit the tolls to rates sufficient to maintain the
                                Canals, pay a reasonable interest on the cost of construction and
                                enlargement, and raise a sinking-fund for the repaying, within a
                                reasonable time, the cost of enlargement; and that the navigation of
                                the River St. Lawrence, the Canadian Canals, the Canals offered by
                                the United States, and Lake Michigan should be enjoyed reciprocally
                                by citizens of the United States and by British subjects. This
                                proposal was declined by the British Commissioners, who repeated
                                that they did not regard the equivalent offered by the United States
                                as at all commensurate with the concessions asked from Great
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 27th of March the proposed enlargement of
                                the Canadian Canals was further discussed. It was stated on the part
                                of the British Commissioners that the Canadian Government were now
                                considering the expediency of enlarging the capacity of the Canals
                                on the River St. Lawrence, and had already provided for the
                                enlargement of the Welland Canal, which would be undertaken without
                                delay.</p>
                            <p>The subject of the export duty in New Brunswick on American lumber
                                floated down the River St. John, was proposed for consideration by
                                the American Commissioners.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 22d of April the British Commissioners
                                proposed that the navigation of Lake Michigan should be given in
                                exchange for the navigation of the River St. Lawrence; and that Her
                                Majesty’s Government should agree to urge upon the Dominion of
                                Canada to give to the citizens of the United States the use of the
                                Canadian Canals on <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0462"/>terms of
                                equality with British subjects; and that the Government of the
                                United States should agree to urge upon the several States to give
                                to British subjects the use of the several State Canals on terms of
                                equality with citizens of the United States. They also proposed, as
                                part of the arrangement, a reciprocal agreement as to transit and
                                transshipment, and that the Government of Great Britain should urge
                                upon New Brunswick not to impose export duties on the lumber floated
                                down the River St. John for shipment to the United States.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners repeated their views as to the navigation
                                of the River St. Lawrence in its natural state.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that they could not admit the
                                claims of American citizens to navigate the River St. Lawrence as of
                                right; but that the British Government had no desire to exclude them
                                from it. They, however, pointed out that there were certain rivers
                                running through Alaska which should on like grounds be declared free
                                and open to British subjects, in case the River St. Lawrence should
                                be declared free.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that they were prepared to
                                consider that question. They also assented to the arrangement as to
                                the canals, which was proposed by the British Commissioners,
                                limiting it, as regarded American Canals, to the canals connected
                                with the navigation of the lakes or rivers traversed by or
                                contiguous to the boundary-line between the British and American
                                possessions. They likewise agreed to give the right of navigating
                                Lake Michigan for a term of years. They desired, and it was agreed,
                                that the transshipment arrangement should be made dependent upon the
                                non-existence of discriminating tolls or regulations on the Canadian
                                Canals, and also upon the abolition of the New Brunswick export duty
                                on American lumber intended for the United States. It was also
                                agreed that the right of carrying should be made dependent upon the
                                non-imposition of export duties on either side on the goods of the
                                other party passing in transit.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of these subjects was further continued at the
                                conferences of the 24th, 25th, and 26th of April, and the Treaty
                                Articles XXVI to XXXIII were agreed to at the conference on the 3d
                                of May.</p>
                            <p>In the course of these discussions the British Commissioners called
                                attention to the question of the survey of the boundary-line along
                                the forty-ninth parallel, which still remained unexecuted from the
                                Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains, and to which reference had
                                been made in the President’s Message.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners stated that the survey was a matter for
                                administrative action, and did not require to be dealt with by a
                                treaty provision. The United States Government would be prepared to
                                agree with the British Government for the appointment of a boundary
                                survey commission in the same manner as had been done in regard to
                                the remainder of the boundary along the forty-ninth parallel as soon
                                as the legislative appropriations and other necessary arrangements
                                could be made.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Articles XXXIV to XLII</hi>.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 15th of March the British Commissioners
                                stated that it was proposed that day to take up the Northwest
                                water-boundary question; that the difference was one of long
                                standing, which had more than once been the subject of negotiations
                                between the two Governments, and that the negotiators had, in
                                January, 1869, agreed upon a treaty. They then proposed that an
                                arbitration of this question should be made upon the basis of the
                                provisions of that Treaty.</p>
                            <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0463"/>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that, though no formal vote was
                                actually taken upon it, it was well understood that that Treaty had
                                not been favorably regarded by the Senate. They declined the
                                proposal of the British Commissioners, and expressed their wish that
                                an effort should be made to settle the question in the Joint High
                                Commission.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners assented to this, and presented the reasons
                                which induced them to regard the Rosario Straits as the channel
                                contemplated by the Treaty of June 15, 1846.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied, and presented the reasons which
                                induced them to regard the Haro Channel as the channel contemplated
                                by that Treaty. They also produced in support of their views some
                                original correspondence of Mr. Everett with his Government, which
                                had not been alluded to in previous discussions of the question.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that they saw in that
                                correspondence no reason to induce them to change the opinion which
                                they had previously expressed. They then asked whether the American
                                Commissioners had any further proposal to make.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that, in view of the position
                                taken by the British Commissioners, it appeared that the Treaty of
                                June 15, 1846, might have been made under a mutual misunderstanding,
                                and would not have been made had each party understood at that time
                                the construction which the other party puts upon the language whose
                                interpretation is in dispute; they therefore proposed to abrogate
                                the whole of that part of the Treaty, and re-arrange the
                                boundary-line which was in dispute before that Treaty was
                                concluded.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners replied that the proposal to abrogate a
                                treaty was one of a serious character, and that they had no
                                instructions which would enable them to entertain it; and at the
                                conference on the 20th of March the British Commissioners declined
                                the proposal.</p>
                            <p>At the conference on the 19th of April the British Commissioners
                                proposed to the American Commissioners to adopt the Middle Channel
                                (generally known as the Douglas Channel) as the channel through
                                which the boundary-line should be run, with the understanding that
                                all the channels through the Archipelago should be free and common
                                to both parties.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners declined to entertain that proposal. They
                                proposed that the Joint High Commission should recognize the Haro
                                Channel as the channel intended by the Treaty of June 15, 1846, with
                                a mutual agreement that no fortifications should be erected by
                                either party to obstruct or command it, and with proper provisions
                                as to any existing proprietary rights of British subjects in the
                                island of San Juan.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners declined this proposal, and stated that,
                                being convinced of the justice of their view of the Treaty, they
                                could not abandon it except after a fair decision by an impartial
                                arbitrator. They therefore renewed their proposal for a reference to
                                arbitration, and hoped that it would be seriously considered.</p>
                            <p>The American Commissioners replied that they had hoped that their
                                last proposal would be accepted. As it had been declined, they
                                would, should the other questions between the two Governments be
                                satisfactorily adjusted, agree to a reference to arbitration to
                                determine whether the line should run through the Haro Channel or
                                through the Rosario Straits, upon the condition that either
                                Government should have the right to include in the evidence to be
                                considered by the Arbitrator such documents, official
                                correspondence, and other official or public statements, bearing on
                                the subject of the reference, as they may consider <pb n="406"
                                    xml:id="pg_406" facs="0464"/>necessary to the support of their
                                respective cases. This condition was agreed to.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners proposed that the Arbitrator should have
                                the right to draw the boundary through an intermediate channel. The
                                American Commissioners declined this proposal, stating that they
                                desired a decision, not a compromise.</p>
                            <p>The British Commissioners proposed that it should be declared to be
                                the proper construction of the Treaty of 1846 that all the channels
                                were to be open to navigation by both parties. The American
                                Commissioners stated that they did not so construe the Treaty of
                                1846, and therefore could not assent to such a declaration.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of this subject was continued during this conference,
                                and in the conference of the 22d of April the Treaty Articles XXXIV
                                to XLII were agreed to.</p>
                            <p>The Joint High Commissioners approved this statement, and directed it
                                to be entered in the protocol.</p>
                            <p>The conference was adjourned to the 6th of May.</p>

                            <p>The High Commissioners having met, the protocol of the conference
                                held on the 4th of May was read and confirmed.</p>
                            <p>Lord de Grey said, that as the Joint High Commission would not meet
                                again after to-day, except for the purpose of signing the Treaty, he
                                desired, on behalf of himself and his colleagues, to express their
                                high appreciation of the manner in which Mr. Fish and his American
                                colleagues had, on their side, conducted the negotiations. It had
                                been most gratifying to the British Commissioners to be associated
                                with colleagues who were animated with the same sincere desire as
                                themselves to bring about a settlement, equally honorable and just
                                to both countries, of the various questions of which it had been
                                their duty to treat, and the British Commissioners would always
                                retain a grateful recollection of the fair and friendly spirit which
                                the American Commissioners had displayed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fish, in behalf of the American Commissioners, said that they
                                were gratefully sensible of the friendly words expressed by Lord de
                                Grey, and of the kind spirit which had prompted them. From the date
                                of the first conference the American Commissioners had been
                                impressed by the earnestness of desire manifested by the British
                                Commissioners to reach a settlement worthy of the two Powers who had
                                committed to this Joint High Commission the treatment of various
                                questions of peculiar interest, complexity, and delicacy. His
                                colleagues and he could never cease to appreciate the generous
                                spirit, and the open and friendly manner in which the British
                                Commissioners had met and discussed the several questions that had
                                led to the conclusion of a Treaty which it was hoped would receive
                                the approval of the people of both countries, and would prove the
                                foundation of a cordial and friendly understanding between them for
                                all time to come.</p>
                            <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0465"/>
                            <p>Mr. Fish farther said that he was sure that every member of the Joint
                                High Commission would desire to record his appreciation of the
                                ability, the zeal, and the unceasing labor which the Joint
                                Protocolists had exhibited in the discharge of their arduous and
                                responsible duties, and that he knew that he only gave expression to
                                the feelings of the Commissioners in saying that Lord Tenterden and
                                Mr. Bancroft Davis were entitled to, and were requested to accept
                                the thanks of, the Joint High Commission for their valuable
                                services, and the great assistance which they had rendered with
                                unvarying obligingness to the Commission.</p>
                            <p>Lord de Grey replied, on behalf of the British Commissioners, that he
                                and his colleagues most cordially concurred in the proposal made by
                                Mr. Fish that the thanks of the Joint High Commission should be
                                tendered to Mr. Bancroft Davis and Lord Tenterden for their valuable
                                services as Joint Protocolists. The British Commissioners were also
                                full as sensible as their American colleagues of the great advantage
                                which the Commission had derived from the assistance which those
                                gentlemen had given them in the conduct of the important
                                negotiations in which they had been engaged.</p>
                            <p>Monday, the 8th of May, was appointed for the signatures of the
                                Treaty.</p>

                                laid before the Arbitrator, and also be mutually communicated in the

                                possession without annexing a copy, such Party shall be bound, if
                                the other Party thinks proper to apply for it, to furnish that Party
                                with a copy thereof, and either Party may call upon the other,
                                through the Arbitrator, to produce the originals or certified copies
