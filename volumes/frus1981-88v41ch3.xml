                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                        <p>(C) The Tenth and potentially final session of the Third United Nations
                            Conference on the Law of the Sea will convene in New York in March.
                            Since a reorganization of the various law of the sea offices in the
                            Department of Defense in 1978, the Department has been represented in
                            law of the sea matters by Vice Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1"
                                >Shannon D. Cramer, Jr.</persName>, U.S. Navy (retired), who has
                            reporting responsibilities both to the Secretary of Defense and the
                            Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. The most recent Conference session,
                            held in Geneva last summer, produced a Draft Convention on the Law of
                            the Sea (Informal Text).<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">In telegram 267139
                                to Naples, October 5, 1980, the Department summarized the draft
                                convention. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D800477–0162)</note> I anticipate a senior-level interagency review
                            of this draft treaty text in the near future.<note n="3"

                        <p>(C) The Department of Defense consistently has taken the position that a
                            comprehensive, acceptable and widely supported Law of the Sea Convention
                            is in the best interests of the United States from a national security
                            standpoint. The Department therefore has supported the negotiating
                            objectives of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Elliot
                                Richardson</persName>, former Head of the U.S. Delegation, and of
                            his successor, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AGH_1">George
                                Aldrich</persName>, acting Delegation Head. The Draft Convention
                            contains important provisions to advance Department of Defense interests
                            in the preservation of critical navigation and overflight rights.</p>
                        <p>—The Draft Convention would set internationally agreed limits upon
                            heretofore expansive unilateral maritime claims of coastal states, by
                            restricting them to a 12-nautical mile territorial sea, a 24-nautical
                            mile contiguous zone, and a 200-nautical mile resource-oriented
                            exclusive economic zone.</p>
                        <p>—The text provides for “transit passage” through and over the
                            approximately 116 international straits which would be overlapped by <pb
                                facs="0392" n="346" xml:id="pg_346"/> 12-mile territorial seas, and
                            archipelagic passage through and over internationally agreed sealanes in
                            the waters of archipelagic states established in accordance with the
                            Convention provisions. These transit rights could not be impeded,
                            hampered or suspended by the archipelagic or straits states. Overflight
                            rights over archipelagic sea lanes and territorial waters in straits do
                            not exist in customary law, but would be conferred by the Draft
                            Convention.</p>
                        <p>—Military vessels and aircraft would be exempted from the pollution
                            provisions of the Convention.</p>
                        <p>—Military activities would, at the option of each state party to the
                            Convention, be exempted from compulsory dispute settlement procedures.
                            The United States would claim this exemption.</p>
                        <p>—Disclosure of information contrary to national security requirements
                            would be precluded.</p>
                        <p>—The specific international legal regime established by the Convention
                            for the International Seabed Authority would be limited to the
                            development of seabed mineral resources.</p>
                        <p>(C) Despite some textual ambiguities, which the State Department has
                            undertaken to clarify through interpretive statements supported by the
                            most important members of the international maritime community,<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">Several of these interpretive statements are

                                <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cramer</persName> and I believe that
                            the Draft Convention, representing a “package deal” of compromises, is
                            in the best interests of the United States with regard to strategic
                            navigation and over-flight needs. On the other hand, representatives of
                            the deep seabed mining industry have expressed opposition to the mining
                            provisions of the Draft Convention as presently drafted. Industry
                            representatives maintain that “assured access” to mining sites is not
                            available under the current text, and that technology transfer
                            requirements which would be imposed under the Convention are
                            economically onerous and unacceptable. In addition, negotiations have
                            yet to obtain provisions satisfactory to industry to protect investment
                            and mining projects undertaken during the period before the treaty
                            enters into force.</p>
                        <p>(C) From a Department of Defense standpoint, the provisions of the Draft
                            Convention which affect our national security interests are the best
                            that can be obtained through the process of negotiation and compromise.
                            Protracted negotiations at this stage are considered likely to pose a
                            significant hazard to the gains which have been achieved. In addition,
                            the absence of the Law of the Sea Convention would leave the
                            international community in a state of uncertainty as to the scope and

                            Conference, with some 150 countries participating, has been underway
                            since 1973, <pb facs="0394" n="348" xml:id="pg_348"/> preceded by five
                            years of preparatory meetings. Stemming from dissatisfaction with the
                            provisions on seabed mining, the options under consideration are:</p>
                        <p>a) to scuttle the Conference based on the conclusion that the Draft
                            Treaty is unacceptable and cannot be made acceptable;</p>
                        <p>b) to continue negotiating along existing paths and, if successful,
                            conclude substantive negotiations at the New York session.
                            (Subsequently, a comprehensive review would be undertaken to decide
                            whether to sign the Treaty. If we do sign, another review would be
                            undertaken—after the Preparatory Commission finishes its work—as part of
                            the decision-making process on whether to ratify.); or</p>
                        <p>c) to continue negotiating along existing paths but, regardless of the
                            outcome of the March session, insist that there be a further substantive
                            negotiating session to provide an opportunity to seek further changes.
                            (A review would be undertaken following the March session to identify
                            further changes needed in the text.)</p>
                        <p>A meeting of principals to discuss the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> position for the New York session is presently
                            contemplated for February 26 or 27.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Currently, no agency publicly advocates scuttling the Conference (option
                            a). Supporters of an additional negotiating session (option c) argue
                            that since time is insufficient prior to the New York session for the
                            new Administration to undertake a comprehensive review, a further
                            negotiating session is necessary to ensure that the new Administration
                            will have options other than accepting or rejecting the entire treaty.
                            It is unclear, however, what changes would be sought in the Draft
                            Convention which are not included already in our negotiating
                            instructions for New York.</p>
                        <p>Supporters of concluding the negotiations in March (option b), if
                            negotiations proceed on schedule and we achieve the positions set forth
                            in our instructions, argue that a further negotiating session is not
                            likely to result in further improvement in the seabed mining provisions,
                            but is more likely to result in erosion of the non-seabed texts which
                            are generally considered closed. All agree that the non-seabed texts
                            protect and advance U.S. interests, particularly those pertaining to
                            freedom of navigation and overflight for military and commercial vessels
                            and aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Since the review paper identifies, and our New York instructions<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">Not further identified.</note> contain,
                            necessary changes to the seabed texts upon which all agencies agree,
                            supporters of option (b) are concerned that advocates of another session
                            will use that opportunity to seek changes so fundamental as <pb
                                facs="0395" n="349" xml:id="pg_349"/> to be tantamount to scuttling
                            the Conference. While the objectives of keeping options open is
                            desirable, it should not be pursued if the costs are to sacrifice the
                            remainder of the treaty, especially since those who would undertake the
                            review at the working level are likely to be the same people who now
                            assert that there is inadequate time for a comprehensive review.</p>
                        <p>Based upon statements made by working level agency representatives at
                            interagency meetings and upon obvious agency interests, the following
                            lineup can be surmised:</p>

                            have confined their attention almost exclusively to seabed mining.
                            Consequently, <gloss target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss> has traditionally
                            supported development of a <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Treaty.

                            concern.</p>
                        <p>In the international sphere, one of the most potentially devastating
                            threats to secure access to strategic minerals is the present status of
                            the Law of the Sea Treaty negotiations. It is my firm conviction, based
                            on information brought to my attention by Members of Congress, as well
                            as representatives of academia, industry and labor, that if the existing
                            negotiating text is not markedly changed, the U.S. deep seabed mining
                            industry will collapse for want of a secure investment climate. Given
                            the hundreds of millions of dollars involved in these projects such a
                            climate is critical.</p>
                        <p>While I have serious reservations regarding much of the current draft
                            convention text, including technology transfer, production limitations

                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi>. The Third United Nations Conference on
                            the Law of the Sea starts its Tenth Session on March 9. The Conference
                            had its origins in two separate initiatives in the late 1960’s. One was
                            a joint U.S.-Soviet initiative to preserve freedoms of navigation,
                            overflight, and maneuver from continually expanding coastal state claims
                            of jurisdiction, and the other was a developing country initiative for
                            the inter<pb facs="0398" n="352" xml:id="pg_352"/>nationalization of the
                            oceans and seabed beyond whatever limits might be placed on coastal
                            state jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The Threat to Navigation</hi>. Following the failure
                            of the Second U.N. Conference in 1960 to agree on a six-mile territorial

                            became clear that a majority of states would soon claim 12-mile
                            territorial seas, and it seemed likely that some claims would continue
                            to expand toward the 200-mile limits already asserted by Ecuador and
                            Peru. Expansion of territorial seas from three to twelve miles would
                            mean that 116 straits with a high seas corridor would become overlapped
                            by territorial seas, in which the customary right was merely one of
                            “innocent passage”—on the surface only for submarines—and with no right
                            of overflight. Among the straits thus affected would be Gibraltar, Bab
                            el Mandeb, Hormuz, and Malacca.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">The “Package Deal” Solution</hi>. In these
                            circumstances, the major maritime powers realized that the best way to
                            preserve their military and commercial rights would be to seek agreement
                            to the necessary rights as part of a “package deal”—a treaty
                            establishing comprehensively the law of the oceans, with enough benefits
                            in it for coastal and straits states so that they would be induced to
                            become Parties to it and accept its limitations on the reach of their
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Internationalization Pressures</hi>. At the same
                            time the developing countries were beginning to press for the
                            internationalization and demilitarization of ocean space, and
                            particularly of the seabed under the high seas. The demilitarization
                            pressures were contained by the adoption in 1971 of the Treaty on the
                            Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of
                            Mass Destruction on the Seabed. The internationalization pressures led
                            to a 1970 U.N. General Assembly resolution declaring the seabeds the
                            “common heritage of mankind,” to the establishment in that year of a
                            U.N. Seabeds Committee and ultimately to the Third U.N. Conference on
                            the Law of the Sea.<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">Reference is to <gloss

                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Non-Seabeds</hi>. We have largely succeeded at the
                            Conference in our efforts to negotiate good provisions protecting our
                            non-seabeds interests, including free transit rights through, over, and
                            under straits, and the maintenance of high seas freedoms of navigation,
                            maneuver, <pb facs="0399" n="353" xml:id="pg_353"/> and overflight in
                            200-mile economic zones, as well as resource jursidiction, pollution
                            control, scientific research, and dispute settlement.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Seabeds</hi>. The seabeds negotiations have proved
                            extremely difficult and have not yet resulted in an acceptable text,
                            although we have achieved significant improvements in that text during
                            the past three years. We have continued to insist that, regardless of
                            the value of the non-seabeds provisions, we could not ratify a treaty
                            that failed to provide the United States and its nationals assured
                            access to seabed resources on reasonable terms and conditions and,
                            therefore, that we would continue to negotiate as long as necessary to
                            produce a ratifiable result.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Risk of Retaliation</hi>. There are some risks in
                            our deliberate approach. Although the Conference has thus far worked
                            largely by consensus, voting remains possible. If the Conference should
                            decide that the United States is the stumbling block to the successful
                            completion of the negotiations, retaliation against our navigation and
                            other non-seabeds interests could be quick and disastrous.</p>

                                Regime</hi>. Since 1978 we have pursued a strategy aimed at
                            simplifying the seabeds text as much as possible and making it
                            acceptable in the sense that, when properly implemented by rules and
                            regulations, it provides assured access.<note n="5" xml:id="d117fn5"

                                    Global Issues</ref>; United Nations Issues.</note> The detailed
                            rules and regulations on the seabeds regime would then be negotiated
                            after the Treaty is opened for signature in a Preparatory Commission
                            that would meet essentially full time for several years. This strategy,
                            if successful, would protect the non-seabeds provisions against
                            retaliation, would increase our leverage in the detailed seabeds
                            negotiations, and would defer until the Preparatory Commission finishes
                            its work (probably 1984 or 1985) any final decision on the acceptability
                            of the resulting seabed regime and the submission of the Treaty to the
                            Senate. Even if it proves impossible to negotiate a satisfactory,
                            detailed seabed regime, the non-seabeds provisions in the Treaty would
                            greatly strengthen our legal position under customary international
                            law.</p>
                        <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Seabed Minerals and Exclusive Rights</hi>. Seabed
                            minerals are of long-term strategic importance, although no one can be
                            certain how long it will be before their recovery and processing will be
                            economical. The richest known concentrations are in the Pacific between
                            Hawaii and Mexico in water nearly three miles deep. Manganese nodules
                            contain nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper, and represent a major
                            potential <pb facs="0400" n="354" xml:id="pg_354"/> resource of the
                            first three metals. A seabed miner requires an exclusive right to an
                            appropriate mine site before he can make the major investment required
                            (at least $1 billion). Since no single state can give such an exclusive
                            right, the only apparent alternative to a satisfactory regime in the
                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Treaty would be a mini-treaty
                            among all states interested in mining. Such a mini-treaty would be
                            considerably more extensive and confrontational than the reciprocal
                            regime we have begun to work out pursuant to our recent seabed mining
                            law, but a mini-treaty could be built on that foundation in the event of
                            failure of the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Conference. The
                            industry enthusiastically supports the reciprocal regime idea. However,
                            a mini-treaty would doubtless be challenged—perhaps harassed—by the
                            Third World and probably the Soviets. Whether investment would occur
                            under such conditions seems questionable.</p>

                            they appreciate the need for a treaty regime, their R and D money is
                            drying up, and they see their very existence threatened by the prolonged
                            period of uncertainty stretching ahead of them. One of our top
                            priorities at the coming session is a special set of protections for
                            pioneer investors designed to give them greater certainty of rights. The
                            American companies involved (U.S. Steel, Lockheed, Kennecott, and SEDCO
                            are the leaders) probably hope ultimately for a Government insurance
                            program to cover the remaining risks and to permit them to compete with
                            subsidized Japanese, German, and French firms. There is considerable
                            Congressional skepticism and concern about the seabed regime in part
                            caused by the industry. Moreover, concentration of the negotiations in
                            recent years on seabeds issues has tended to cause the importance of the
                            non-seabeds issues to slip from Congressional and public view.</p>

                        <p>The Senior Interagency Group meeting on March 2 decided that, in light of
                            the fact that the Administration has not had an opportunity to fully
                            consider the Law of the Sea, we should try to ensure that informal
                            negotiations are not concluded at the forthcoming Tenth Session of the
                            Conference (March 9–April 17).<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">No record of
                                this meeting has been found.</note> Studies should begin immediately
                            to bring new personnel in the interested Departments and Agencies up to
                            date, and a thorough review of the Draft Convention, particularly the
                            deep seabed mining provisions, should be made by the Interagency Group
                            on the Law of the Sea. The review should be concluded in time to permit
                            the Administration to determine its position toward the negotiations and
                            issue instructions to the Delegation in advance of the next session of
                            the Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Group also decided that the Delegation should make clear to other
                            delegations that the review will cover all matters of concern to the
                            Administration and that no issue is necessarily excluded from it so that
                            there can be no question about our continuing good faith in the
                            negotiations as we seek further improvements in the seabed texts at this
                            session. At the same time, the Group recognized that we must keep in
                            mind the need to prevent retaliatory changes in the non-seabeds texts,
                            and we should avoid public statements implying that this review is
                            likely to result in rejection of the Draft Convention and statements
                            stressing the value to the United States of the non-seabeds
                            provisions.</p>

                        <p>1. (C) The Administration, through the head of the US delegation to the
                            Law of the Sea Conference, has announced that it intends to review the
                            entire text of the Draft Convention on the Law of the Sea (Informal
                            Text) (<gloss target="#t_DCIT_1">DCIT</gloss>), particularly the deep
                            seabed mining provisions.</p>
                        <p>2. (S) The Department of Defense has a vital interest in the Law of the
                            Sea treaty. The Navy recently conducted a comprehensive legal and
                            operational analysis of the <gloss target="#t_DCIT_1">DCIT</gloss>.<note

                                Objectives in Law of the Sea Negotiations (U).” [Footnote is in the

                            <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> position on the draft treaty. The
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff support the draft treaty from a national security
                            standpoint, if it is accompanied by interpretive statements clarifying
                            certain articles and if those statements are supported by a significant
                            portion of the world community, including the major maritime powers.</p>
                        <p>3. (U) The trend in customary international law is to restrict free
                            transit of the oceans by expansion of the territorial sea from 3 to 12
                            nautical miles. This expansion of the territorial sea closes 116 straits
                            to navigation except in innocent passage, which does not include
                            submerged transit or overflight. The draft treaty would preserve the
                            right of submerged transit and overflight through these key straits by a
                            new regime called transit passage. A similar new regime also preserves
                            navigational and overflight rights through archipelagoes, another area
                            in which there is a trend in customary international law toward
                            restriction of free passage.</p>
                        <p>4. (C) The position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the draft treaty
                            rests on the fact that it would preserve navigational freedoms that
                            would probably otherwise be lost.<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> underlined the phrase
                                “would probably otherwise be lost.”</note> The treaty would also
                            slow the <pb facs="0406" n="360" xml:id="pg_360"/> proliferation of
                            maritime claims and provide a legal foundation and a widely agreed
                            standard against which maritime claims can be measured.</p>
                        <p>5. (S) The Law of the Sea negotiations have been marked by a series of
                            delicately balanced compromises in which no nation has achieved all that
                            it has sought. At the start of the present negotiating session, it was
                            widely accepted that negotiations had been concluded with respect to the
                            navigational articles covering matters of critical importance to US
                            national security interests. Although those articles are not ideal, and
                            a final <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> position cannot be taken
                            until negotiations are completed, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that
                            the navigational articles protect US national security interests. The
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff further consider that the navigational articles in
                            the present text of the draft are the best that can be achieved under
                            the circumstances. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that those
                            aspects of the treaty dealing with seabed mining remain unresolved.
                            However, the United States should not seek to reopen those navigational
                            and other non-seabed articles of the draft treaty that have heretofore
                            been considered resolved, and we should strongly resist any efforts by
                            other nations to reopen those articles.</p>

                        <p>2. (C) On March 2, a Senior Interagency Group on the Law of the Sea took
                            the following decisions: (A) a thorough review of all aspects of the
                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> draft Convention, particularly
                            the deep seabed mining provisions, should be undertaken; (B) pending the
                            completion of the review, the United States delegation to the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention should undertake to ensure
                            that negotiations not be concluded during the 9 March–17 April session
                            of the conference; and (C) the delegation should make clear to other
                            delegations that the review will cover all matters of concern to the
                            administration, that no issue is necessarily excluded from it, and that
                            there can be no question about our continuing good faith in the
                            negotiations.</p>

                            Delegation was authorized to go forward with a work program in

                            to review the draft convention was based on concerns of industry,
                            Congress, and the administration itself.</p>
                        <p>(A) On the industry side, concerns had been raised regarding the
                            protection of mining investments made prior to the coming into force <pb

                            Representatives would pass enabling legislation necessary to implement
                            the treaty.</p>
                        <p>5. (U) Should occasion arise, US Missions should actively seek to
                            emphasize the administration’s determination to conduct a full and
                            impartial review. The administration has not prejudged the outcome of
                            its interagency review. Our view is that it is only reasonable for a new
                            administration to need some time to understand the complex <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> issues and relate them to its own
                            objectives. It is important that the new administration have a full
                            grasp of the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> issues as well as
                            absolute confidence in the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            delegation in order to preserve international confidence in our
                            intentions, to prevent the unravelling of the draft convention effort,
                            and to maintain our credibility with Congress. In this regard, it is
                            also important that a new administration place its own people in key
                            management positions. Consequently, a decision was reached on March 7 to
                            replace the then Acting Special Representative of the President with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s own choice

                            Administration has decided to conduct a comprehensive review of U.S.
                            interests in the oceans and the extent to which they are, or may be,
                            protected by a Law of the Sea Treaty. Among those interests are those of
                            our industrialized country allies, and the Administration wishes to be
                            particularly sensitive in its review process to your views. In
                            particular, the advantage of solidarity among the industrialized
                            countries within and outside of formal multilateral negotiating forums
                            is a matter of considerable importance to this Administration.
                            Accordingly, it is our intention that the delegations to whom this memo
                            is addressed be as fully incorporated as possible into our review
                            process at all stages.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to provide background on the
                            methodology of our review process and to share with you the interests
                            and objectives we have identified.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Methodology</p>
                        <p>The review will be carried out in several phases, of which only the first
                            is now under way.</p>
                        <p>Phase 1. Identification of those United States and allied interests that
                            are significantly affected by the Law of the Sea, and the establishment
                            of our objectives;</p>
                        <p>Phase 2. Evaluation of the extent to which the Draft Convention
                            accommodates U.S. and allied interests and objectives;</p>
                        <p>Phase 3. Determination of the nature of the amendments that would be
                            essential to conform the treaty to U.S. and allied interests and
                            objectives;</p>
                        <p>Phase 4. Assessment of the negotiability of a treaty that would be
                            consonant with U.S. and allied interests and objectives;</p>
                        <p>Phase 5. Analysis of the no-treaty alternative in light of U.S. and
                            allied interests and objectives;</p>
                        <pb facs="0410" n="364" xml:id="pg_364"/>
                        <p>Phase 6. Determination of actions required to promote and protect U.S.
                            and allied interests and objectives in the no-treaty scenario;</p>
                        <p>Phase 7. Assessment of the manageability of the no-treaty alternative in
                            terms of U.S. and allied interests and objectives;</p>
                        <p>Phase 8. Comparative analysis of the treaty and no-treaty options;</p>
                        <p>Phase 9. Decision on whether to proceed with the treaty or no-treaty
                            alternative; and</p>
                        <p>Phase 10. Decision on strategy to implement decisions.</p>
                        <p>We believe it is essential that in the prosecution of the policy review,
                            the foregoing elements be treated as entirely discrete. In the past, the
                            identification of U.S. and allied interests and objectives has been
                            confused with opinions concerning negotiability. Perhaps this has been
                            the product of a strong presumption in favor of the treaty approach.
                            Such a presumption does not exist in this review. In the course of the
                            review, it may be desirable to treat several of these phases together in
                            a single paper. This has not yet been determined.</p>

                            previous administrations dating back to 1960, when the prospect of a new
                            treaty on the law of the sea was first given consideration.</p>
                        <p>It is not likely that these objectives will undergo significant change in
                            the course of the policy review process. The purpose of the review is to
                            determine relative priorities of these objectives and the extent to
                            which they will or can be accommodated in a comprehensive law of the sea
                            convention. Additionally, the policy review process will study carefully
                            the alternative measures which may be taken if the convention is found
                            to be unsatisfactory, or if a judgment is made that it cannot be
                            improved so as fully to protect our priorities. The following is a
                            listing of the objectives we have identified to date.</p>

                        <p>—an innocent passage regime that is clear and objective and circumscribes

                        <p>The Administration is anxious to ensure that this policy review process
                            is fair and impartial and does not reflect any predisposition toward
                            priorities or methods of achieving the priority objectives. Possible
                            decisions could range from a decision to maintain the <hi rend="italic"
                                >status quo</hi> and conclude the draft convention as quickly as
                            possible to a decision based on a diametrically opposed view.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the review we will consult widely with the
                            industrialized countries as well as the developing countries, with
                            leading members of the American Congress, with our public advisors and
                            with members of affected industry groups. This will be a thorough and
                            painstaking process and will take considerable time. The probability
                            that this process will be completed and final decisions taken prior to
                            the fall of 1981 is very low.</p>
                        <p>Certain main undercurrents of thinking in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration should be
                            emphasized because they will bear directly on the policy review process.
                            These considerations lie in the following broad areas:</p>
                        <p>A. Is the treaty the best way to secure the freedoms of the seas upon
                            which maritime powers depend for their national security, their
                            collective security and their transportation requirements? We will weigh
                            the question of whether customary international law is a superior or
                            inferior vehicle for protecting those freedoms. In that connection, we
                            will also want to examine closely whether there has been any change in
                            our military requirements during the past decade in respect of how <pb
                                facs="0413" n="367" xml:id="pg_367"/> we use the oceans, and whether
                            it would be necessary even under the convention as drafted to take
                            unilateral or multilateral measures to ensure that freedom of the seas
                            would not be eroded by our agreement to the provisions of the draft
                            convention.</p>
                        <p>B. We will wish to study carefully the extent to which multilateral
                            conferences in the last decade and international organizations created
                            pursuant to multilateral treaties reflect a realistic understanding of
                            the economic and political strength of the United States and its allies.
                            This Administration has observed a drift in <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Conferences and negotiations toward the collective
                            assertion of political and economic power by the developing countries.
                            It is important to determine whether this drift has been in our
                            collective best interest and whether, if it is not, it can be
                            redirected.</p>
                        <p>C. The basic tenents of the North/South dialogue which have been advanced
                            by the developing countries may not be consistent with the economic
                            well-being of the industrialized and (possibly even most) developing
                            countries. There is a widespread view that more economic benefit to more
                            countries will accrue under a system which encourages productivity and
                            economic efficiency than under a system of forced wealth transfer. We
                            will want to evaluate this view carefully since the Draft Convention on
                            the Law of the Sea is a major step in the direction being pursued by the
                            developing countries in the North/South dialogue.</p>
                        <p>D. We have a heightened appreciation of the vulnerability of the
                            industrialized countries to the control of critical natural resources by
                            others. We intend to review with care the extent to which deepsea mining
                            can provide a secure, uninterrupted supply of certain critical raw
                            materials. We are also deeply concerned with the potentially vast and
                            still unknown resources to be found beneath the surface of the seabed.
                            We will want to examine carefully whether such resources should be
                            subject to any international regulatory system pending both their
                            identification and a better understanding of their value to our
                            economies.</p>
                        <p>E. We will examine carefully the extent to which the economic interests
                            within 200 miles of any nation’s coast can be fully protected in the
                            absence of a comprehensive convention.</p>
                        <p>F. We will pay particular attention in our review to the question of
                            whether the problems addressed in the text of the treaty can be also
                            solved through a series of bilateral and multilateral undertakings
                            ranging from navigational questions to fishing, deepsea mining,
                            scientific research and pollution control. This inquiry will be in
                            addition to the question of whether many of these interests can be
                            accommodated under customary international law.</p>
                        <p>While we wish to emphasize that our review does not proceed from a
                            predisposition regarding the treaty, it should also be clear that <pb
                                facs="0414" n="368" xml:id="pg_368"/> there is considerable
                            scepticism in the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                            Administration about the fundamental underlying assumptions upon which
                            the present Draft Convention is premised and about the extent to which
                            such underlying assumptions, if found to be erroneous, should continue
                            to guide our foreign policy in the oceans.</p>
                        <p>We will value your views and suggestions on a continuing basis during the
                            course of this review, and we will have a special interest in adjusting
                            our decisions so as to enhance the prospects of solidarity within this
                            group of industrialized countries.</p>

                            REVIEW</p>
                        <p>The overall reaction was cautious, although some developing country
                            representatives—like Venezuela—are evidencing very deep anger.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union clearly sought to capitalize on the situation. It was an
                            excellent opportunity since the Soviet comments were relatively
                            restrained, and while the Soviet Union threatened us with voting in
                            private, her public posture was one of continuing support for
                            consensus.</p>
                        <p>The reaction among US allies was mixed. France was highly enthusiastic in

                            with developing countries. The German delegation in general sees our

                            Economics Ministry’s enthusiasm for our review is evident to the entire
                            Conference. At the other end of the spectrum, Australia and New Zealand
                            have openly defended the existing pack<pb facs="0415" n="369"

                        <p>The main underlying question preoccupying the delegates is, and will
                            remain, whether to go ahead and vote through a Convention without U.S.
                            support. The factors affecting this decision will include:</p>
                        <p>1. Foreign perceptions regarding the negotiability of any new U.S.
                            proposals, and the credibility of an Administration commitment to
                            support ratification of a treaty that accommodates its proposals;</p>
                        <p>2. Whether the Soviet Union and a significant number of Western States
                            are willing to join the developing countries in such action; not only in
                            terms of voting, but in terms of ratification;</p>
                        <p>3. The effect, if any, of such action by a large number of countries on
                            bilateral relations between the US and any one of those countries.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">COMMITTEE TWO</hi></p>
                        <p>The meetings of Committee Two reflected a strong desire to put pressure
                            on the U.S. not to propose changes in texts under the Committee’s
                            mandate. This pressure was reflected in three ways.</p>
                        <p>1. Interventions by developing countries led by the Philippines, and
                            stage-managed by Peru, to require prior authorization and notification
                            for warships in the territorial sea, coastal State control of all
                            installations and structures on the continental shelf, and similar kinds
                            of <pb facs="0416" n="370" xml:id="pg_370"/> suggestions aimed at
                            restricting military activities. These interventions were stronger than
                            in previous sessions.</p>
                        <p>2. Interventions by other maritime powers and the Eastern Bloc to the
                            general effect that the fundamental elements of the Committee Two
                            package had been negotiated and should not be reopened.</p>
                        <p>3. The summary by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AAM_1"
                                >Aguilar</persName> to the effect that there existed in the

                        <p>Of particular note was the effort by Cape Verde, supported by a
                            substantial number of delegations, for the establishment of a small
                            working group to deal with the warship issue, and also the strength of
                            the attack mounted by Amb. Arias-Schreiber of Peru. This attack was met
                            head on with equal ferocity by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, which took on Peru on both procedural and substantive
                            grounds.</p>
                        <p>On the delimination issue, it was clear that no solution could be
                            achieved at this session, despite strong efforts by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KTT_1">Koh</persName> to pressure a solution. The lack
                            of political will on the part of the negotiators was laid in part on the
                            nature of this particular session in the light of the ongoing U.S.
                            review process. Neither side wished to proceed until such time as the
                            U.S. was in a position to participate actively.</p>
                        <p>The Committee was held together, once again, by the strong and able
                            leadership of Amb. <persName corresp="#p_AAM_1">Aguilar</persName>.

                            lengthy, followed the same lines as in Committee debates, and
                            constituted a clear indication that many coastal State delegations were
                            ready and willing to do battle on a number of military-related issues

                            private hints that the Group of 77 might in the end drop this position

                            perhaps on a separate page. The US delegation did not indicate whether
                            it could accept such a result.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dispute Settlement</p>
                        <p>During the tenth session, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee,
                            Ambassador Beesley (Canada), asked his associate Armad deMestral
                            (Canada) to explore the possibility of convening a small group which
                            could do some advance work in order to facilitate the task of the
                            Language Group and the Drafting Committee when dealing with the dispute
                            settlement parts of the Convention. Messrs. Caflisch (Switzerland) and
                            Allott (U.K.) prepared extensive lists of drafting changes required in
                            the French and English texts, respectively. Professor Sohn (U.S.) was
                            asked to join these exploratory talks.</p>
                        <p>It proved difficult to reach agreement on the composition of a working
                            group on this subject and on the method of its creation. A preliminary
                            exploration of the problems involved in coordinating the text resulted
                            immediately in extensive debates on the character of the changes
                            proposed (whether they were drafting or substantive). Consequently, it
                            was quickly agreed that the task was more difficult than the proponents
                            of this approach anticipated, and that no shortcuts are possible. The
                            only solution would be to allot sufficient time for the discussion of
                            dispute settlement texts at the next meeting of the Committee.</p>

                        <p>Agreement was reached on the following general points:</p>
                        <p>—The Delegation should preserve the widest possible range of options from
                            which the President may choose at the conclusion of the policy review
                            this fall. This means that formalization of the current text or adoption
                            of amendments to it running counter to U.S. interests should be
                            prevented and that the Delegation should not commit or appear to commit
                            the good faith of the United States.</p>
                        <p>—The Delegation should obtain the most accurate and complete assessment
                            possible of the negotiability of changes in the current text. <pb

                                testified before the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee
                                on April 28, 1981. For the text of his statement, see Department of

                        <p>The group discussed the advisability of authorizing the Delegation to
                            offer, if appropriate, a “positive alternative” (free market model)
                            seabed mining regime that would substitute entirely for the current
                            text. The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> representative expressed
                            personal doubts about the wisdom of this approach, while Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KTG_1">Kronmiller</persName> defended it. There was no
                            dissent, expressed as an agency position, to the notion of providing the
                            proposed authority.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there was discussion of the question of how to handle the
                            non-seabeds texts (navigation, coastal State rights, marine scientific
                            research, etc.). The pros and cons of asking for leaving the texts
                            unchanged, were analyzed. It was agreed that, generally, these issues
                            should be avoided in the Conference proceedings in Geneva, though
                            relatively discrete matters might be discussed informally in small
                            groups. The reasoning was that the political traffic might bear no more
                            than the detailed discussion of U.S. concerns regarding seabeds. The
                            risks of damage to non-seabeds interests from a U.S. initiative
                            regarding them in the formal Conference process was regarded as
                            excessive.</p>
                        <p>A first draft of instructions to the Delegation is being prepared based
                            on the meeting, and should be ready for circulation by COB Friday, July

                            <p>The Senior Interagency Group on Law of the Sea decided on March 2,
                                    1981<note n="5" xml:id="d126fn5">See Documnet 118.</note>to
                                conduct a policy review that would identify U.S. objectives in the
                                Law of the Sea (informal text) of September, 1980 to determine its
                                compatibility with those objectives, and elaborate options for the
                                achievement of those objectives. The U.S. Delegation to the Tenth
                                Session of the Third U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea, which
                                took place in New York in March and April 1981,<note n="6"
                                    xml:id="d126fn6">See <ref target="#d123">Document
                                    123</ref>.</note> was instructed to prevent conclusion of
                                negotiations until the review was completed. Negotiations were not
                                concluded, but a resumed Tenth Session was scheduled for Geneva in
                                August 1981.</p>
                            <p>Several tasks mandated by the Senior Interagency Group have been
                                largely accomplished. U.S. objectives have been identified, and the
                                Draft Convention is being measured against them. Information
                                concerning the negotiability of desired changes in the text gained
                                at August session will be incorporated into the analyses of the
                                options for the President. The time-table for the review calls for
                                the options to be presented for decision in the late fall.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">II. Instructions for the August Session</p>
                            <p>The Delegation should seek to achieve the following at the Resumed
                                Tenth Session:</p>
                            <pb facs="0424" n="378" xml:id="pg_378"/>
                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Preserve the full range of options for pursuing
                                    U.S. Law of the Sea objectives</hi>. The Delegation should
                                prevent steps from being taken that would make an acceptable treaty
                                on the Law of the Sea impossible to achieve. In particular, the
                                Delegation should make every effort to avert formalization or other
                                prejudicial changes in status of the Draft Convention. The
                                delegation should oppose changes to the negotiating text that would
                                unravel it, or other changes running counter to U.S. objectives.
                                However, specific changes favorable to U.S. interests may be
                                accepted by the Delegation if they do not adversely affect the
                                delegation’s overall ability to achieve changes fundamental to U.S.
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>In order to preserve options outside the Conference context, the
                                Delegation should not conduct itself in a manner that could be
                                perceived as committing the U.S. to a comprehensive Law of the Sea
                                treaty. The Delegation should continue to indicate that no decision
                                for or against pursuing such a treaty has been made, but that the
                                U.S. is committed to rule of law in international affairs.<note

                        <p>The Secretary said the U.S. was in an extremely sensitive position in the
                            law of the sea negotiations. He observed that the law of the sea had
                            been raised with him by 26 chiefs of state and heads of government and
                            the only one sympathetic to the U.S. position have been the West Germans
                            and the Belgians and maybe the Soviets. He quoted the Soviet Foreign
                            Minister as saying “For God’s sake, be careful.”<note n="2"

                        <p>The Secretary referred to his talks with leaders of the ASEAN states.
                            Even China had complained.<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">In telegram 821

                            expressed the view that in the last analysis the Soviets would take a
                            middle ground.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the delegation instructions, the Secretary said that they were
                            negative in character.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            replied that the presentation of the U.S. position would not be hard
                            line but would instead be up beat. He said he would make it clear the
                            U.S. wants to continue to be part of the negotiating process.</p>
                        <pb facs="0430" n="384" xml:id="pg_384"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said we are approaching the negotiations with the aim of
                            reaching agreement on a treaty but we have a serious problem. We do not
                            want to have another SALT II. The President has insisted that there be a
                            thorough review.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the State Department’s assessment of the
                            navigation provisions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            replied that some problems have been identified, specifically there are
                            some ambiguities in the regime in the Economic Zone. He noted that the
                            Joint Chiefs agreed with that analysis.<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">See

                        <p>The Secretary asked what <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>’s assessment
                            of the navigation provisions was. The Secretary asked whether the
                            problem of clarifying the navigation texts would be aired at the August
                            session of the Conference.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            said that the US would seek to concentrate on deep seabed issues at the
                            Conference. He recognized the risk that if navigation issues were
                            discussed, this could lead to unravelling the navigation text.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                >Malone</persName> would do if the rhetoric leads to a revolution in
                            the conference.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            replied that in general other nations want the U.S. to be a party to the
                            treaty and will probably try to cooperate, knowing that if a crisis is
                            avoided the chance for a successful treaty will be improved. The Soviets
                            want the treaty because of the navigation provisions and will probably
                            be of assistance.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the notes prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                >Malone</persName> for the meeting outlining objectives,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d127fn5">Not found.</note> the Secretary observed that there
                            seemed to be a contradiction. Exploring negotiating changes, preventing
                            the treaty from unraveling and keeping the text from being formalized
                            made sense. The Secretary asked about the objective of avoiding a
                            commitment to negotiating a <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty
                            while continuing in the process.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            agreed that was the difficult part.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that not only is the U.S. prepared to continue to
                            take part in the process, the U.S. wants to take part. The Secretary
                            directed that the U.S. delegation pull off before it causes a crisis at
                            the Conference.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            agreed to that.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the specific instructions,<note n="6" xml:id="d127fn6">See
                                    <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref> and the attachment
                                thereto.</note> the Secretary made a general observation that they
                            seemed too negative. He said he would like to see the U.S. delegation
                            proceed with good will.</p>
                        <pb facs="0431" n="385" xml:id="pg_385"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            indicated that he would be flexible when he presented the U.S.
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he was happy that no major substantive
                            modification of the navigation texts will be sought. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi> pointed out
                            that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s position on these provisions
                            was not yet certain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he found the third general objective too negative. The
                            Secretary characterized the language in the draft treaty on permanent
                            seats in the Council as “insane” and directed that the language of the
                            delegation instructions not be softened.</p>
                        <p>On the instructions regarding the powers of the Authority, the Secretary
                            urged that the delegation not state the U.S. position in those terms in
                            the negotiations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            said he would not present these points in the language of the
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the language in the instructions on
                            strengthening institutional safeguards was “dynamite.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary directed that the two paragraphs on powers of the review
                            conference and specifications of organs for every function be preceded
                            by “seek to.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed to the instruction on participation of liberation
                            organizations and said he understood that the question of fair labor and
                            safety standards would be sorted out.</p>
                        <p>On the access issue, the Secretary expressed the view that it appeared
                            the Delegation was attempting to revise the entire seabeds section. The
                            Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                >Malone</persName> had experts who could judge the doability of
                            these objectives.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            said there were three members of the delegation who had participated in
                            the negotiations since the very beginning.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether they were comfortable with the
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            said they were satisfied it was possible to explore the prospects for
                            finding compromise solutions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what was behind the moratorium issue. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> explained that it was a
                            reaction to the passage of U.S. deep seabed mining legislation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the problem associated with the anti-subsidy
                            clause. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                    >Malone</persName></hi> said the U.S. wants to avoid production
                            limitations. He described the role of Canada and the involvement of
                            Zambia, Zaire and Zimbabwe.<note n="7" xml:id="d127fn7">In telegram 1041

                        <p>The Secretary said he understood everyone was concerned with mandatory

                                    >Malone</persName></hi> indicated there were two aspects: forced
                            sale of technology and transfer of technology which has security
                            significance. This kind of provision would be intolerable in the context

                        <p>The Secretary asked what the problem was with the provision on anadromous

                            entirely consistent with the US position. The US wants tuna controlled
                            through regional arrangements. The existing texts are ambiguous and the
                            U.S. would like to eliminate coastal states control.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the Committee III text. <hi rend="italic">Mr.

                        <p>The Secretary asked about the next session of the <gloss

                            the second week would be used to take up the substantive issues. He said
                            he thought if the U.S. could get through the second week without major

                            said it seemed that the U.S. had already received warning signs; the
                            Soviets seemed to have concluded that the U.S. was isolated.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            disagreed, saying he believed the Soviets would play a middle ground
                            role because they want a treaty and they want the U.S. to be a party to
                            the treaty. However, if the Soviets concluded the U.S. was isolated at
                            the Conference, they might try to get some political mileage out of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Bremer</persName></hi>
                            said he thought the Soviets had made their position very clear. <hi

                            and indicated they would cooperate in some areas.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary stated that the U.S. was zapping the treaty. He asked how
                            the decisions were made on what issues were essential, what were nice,
                            and what could be discarded. He said what was needed was a matrix; a
                            priority listing of issues; what we have is a grab bag of agency
                            issues.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that, in fact, some things are really not needed and
                            it must be recognized that the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            treaty cannot be perfect.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            noted that some elements of the present version of the <gloss

                            philosophy of the Administration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that it would be hard for the President to walk
                            away from the treaty which had been negotiated under three
                            administrations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            said the U.S. delegation objective will be to convince the other
                            delegations that we are prepared to talk.</p>

                            urged that if it were possible, it would be desirable to avoid raising
                            these issues prior to the Cancun meeting<note n="10" xml:id="d127fn10"

                            to make trouble.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the President has not focused on the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> issues. He went on to say that there
                            was not a prayer of getting through all of the seabed issues in the
                            proposed instructions without a disaster. That may be the right thing to
                            do but not without the President’s decision.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that we must remember the cost if the U.S. scuttles
                            the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked for a list of the most important issues;
                            specifically, an in-house review on what are the bedrock issues; what we
                            can throw away, what can be traded off and what other countries can be
                            persuaded to carry the burden of negotiating some of these issues.<note

                        </list>
                        <p>The next session of the Law of the Sea Conference begins in Geneva on
                            Monday, August 3. The principal U.S. objectives are (a) to keep open the
                            draft treaty pending your final decision on the U.S. approach to the
                            treaty, (b) to buy time until other elements of our policy toward the
                            developing countries can be announced and take hold, and (c) to assess
                            carefully the negotiability of needed improvements.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of our analysis of the draft treaty text, it is clear that
                            many of the key provisions dealing with the deep seabed mining regime
                            are incompatible with basic policies and principles of the
                            Administration and would present problems in the Congress which would
                            render the treaty unratifiable.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">An unknown
                                hand underlined the phrase “would render the treaty
                                unratifiable.”</note> In Geneva, the delegation will seek to prevent
                            the Law of the Sea Conference from breaking up in a way prejudicial to
                            U.S. interests or resulting in a major crisis which would bring the
                            negotiations to a halt and subject the U.S. to strong criticism.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation will seek to concentrate the work of the Conference
                            on the area of principal concern to us: the provisions of the treaty
                            dealing with the deep seabed. Although U.S. interests could be improved
                            by changes in the navigation texts we should pursue these issues outside
                            the Conference setting, in more manageable bilateral and limited
                            multilateral contexts.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to predict with certainty what the negotiating
                            environment will be in Geneva. Our best estimate at this time is that
                            many key countries in the negotiations want a Law of the Sea treaty and
                            want the United States to be a party.</p>
                        <p>Still, there are risks which must be recognized. At a minimum we can
                            expect sharp criticism of the U.S. Law of the Sea policy. Some
                            delegates, chiefly in the so-called Group of 77 may well attempt to <pb
                                facs="0435" n="389" xml:id="pg_389"/> isolate the U.S. with the
                            tactical objective of holding U.S. demands to a minimum. Once started
                            however, the isolation tactic may not be controllable. Should a large
                            number of delegates become persuaded that the United States stands alone
                            and in opposition to the treaty and is not prepared to negotiate in good
                            faith, then our ability to prevent a move to formalize the text would be
                            substantially dependent on the assistance of our allies and the
                            neutrality or aid of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In such
                            a situation, it is by no means clear to what extent we can count on the
                            support of certain key friends and allies who, in general, may be
                            reluctant to oppose the majority of Third World nations. Clearly, the
                            Soviets could exploit such a situation to our disadvantage and gain
                            political favor with the developing countries. The Soviets have recently
                            informed us that they will support the existing treaty text.</p>
                        <p>There is thus a risk that we might fail to control the process, and
                            either an unsatisfactory treaty will be adopted or the Conference may
                            break up, with the United States being held responsible. A collapse of
                            the Conference could result<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">An unknown hand
                                underlined the phrases “thus a risk that we might fail to control,”
                                “unsatisfactory treaty will be,” “break up, with the United States
                                being held responsible,” and “Conference could result.”</note> in
                            publicity critical of the United States and could sharply affect the
                            character of other multilateral negotiations in which the United States
                            is taking part. However, there is no risk-free way we can hold the
                            treaty open, pending your final decision.</p>
                        <p>While it is not clear how our substantive interests in oceans law might
                            be affected by formalization of the treaty without U.S. participation,
                            it raises the risk that some states may retaliate in ways which might
                            adversely affect certain navigational and other rights which we have
                            claimed.</p>
                        <p>Although the U.S. delegation will attempt to manage the negotiations in a
                            manner which takes account of the foregoing risks, the inherent
                            uncertainties in the process raise the possibility that those
                            navigational interests which we have thus far secured may be jeopardized
                            through renegotiation or breakdown of the whole Conference.</p>

                        <p>1. (S) As you are aware, procedural arrangements were agreed to last
                                week<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See footnote 27, Document

                            concerns in a positive, non-confrontational forum. Pursuant to this
                            arrangement, on 13 August, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                >Malone</persName> presented, in fairly direct and specific terms, a
                            list of eight major objections to the seabed regime contained in the
                            present <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> text.<note n="3"

                                Central Foreign Policy File, D810378–0618)</note> As expected,
                            initial reaction has been strongly negative among G–77 members and
                            others primarily because they are finally beginning to realize that the
                            U.S. is seriously questioning the fundamental principles upon which the
                            previously negotiated regime is based. Up until now there was some
                            residual hope that the U.S. was only posturing for tactical
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>2. (S) Although the situation is volatile, I continue to believe that
                            precipitous action such as a final vote on the text can be avoided at
                            this session. As a precautionary measure we are in the process of
                            identifying states that would be likely to support the U.S. under the
                            rules of procedure which provide for a ten-day cooling-off period prior
                            to any substantive vote (a minimum of 15 states would have to join us in
                            a motion to delay a vote). In this regard, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> strongly concurs with Dr.
                            Ikle’s desire to obtain maximum support for a negative vote should the
                            need arise.</p>

                            were given the signal that the Department of Defense is maintaining a

                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> conference decided in plenary
                            session yesterday on the status of the draft convention and future
                            sessions of the conference. The full text was sent yesterday in Geneva’s
                            8552. The purpose of this telegram is to analyze that conference
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>3. As G–77 and Soviet perceptions of the US position became more clear
                            during this session the desire to formalize the text became widespread.
                            The original arrangement we made with Brazil to keep this session of the
                            conference under control began to look uncertain for <pb facs="0438"
                                n="392" xml:id="pg_392"/> awhile.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">In
                                telegram 7865 from Geneva, August 3, <gloss target="#t_USUN_1"
                                    >USUN</gloss> outlined a proposal from Brazil wherein the “U.S.
                                would agree now that at the end of this session the President of the
                                Conference would issue a new treaty text incorporating the drafting
                                committee’s changes. The new text would be labeled the ‘draft
                                convention on the Law of the Sea’ and the words ‘informal text’
                                would be dropped from the title. On issuing the text the President
                                would announce that this new text could be changed or amended only
                                in accordance with the same rule of procedure applicable to earlier
                                texts—the rule of consensus. The new text thus would remain
                                informal. If the U.S. agrees now to this result, Brazil will
                                undertake to ensure a quiet session giving ample time for full
                                discussion of the U.S. areas of concern in an atmosphere free of
                                rhetoric, threats of voting, or other G–77 induced crises.”
                                (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D810463–0846)</note> By the middle of last week the Eastern
                            European, Asians, Latin Americans and African groups had all taken
                            decisions in favor of formalization. It was clear to us that these
                            decisions were taken out of the desire to send a message to Washington
                            rather than from a conviction that US concerns should be summarily
                            dismissed.</p>
                        <p>4. In the face of these developments, we were able to arrange for a
                            private dialogue last Sunday<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4">August
                                23.</note> with many of the conference leaders to put our position
                            in as favorable a light as possible and to urge that flexibility on
                            their part would create a better atmosphere in Washington for continued
                            active participation next year. As a result of these and other efforts
                            it was possible on Monday<note n="5" xml:id="d130fn5">August 24.</note>
                            to convert the conference decision reported in reftel 8852 into a
                            document which is in full compliance with our instructions.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d130fn6">Draft instructions and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                    >Haig</persName>’s comments are in <ref target="#d126">Document
                                    126</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>5. The conference decision indicates that the text will have a higher
                            status in the future and characterizes it as the “official draft
                            convention” of the conference. Last minute negotiations yesterday with
                            the conference leadership resulted in removing the words “formal text”
                            and this change is widely known at the conference which improves the
                            record from our point of view. The three conditions explaining the
                            status of the text make clear beyond question at the conference that the
                            text has no status different from the previous texts and cannot be used
                            as a launching platform for submitting formal amendments.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d130fn7">See <ref target="#d130fn3">footnote 3</ref>,
                                above.</note> Moreover, this decision extends into the next session
                            of the conference.</p>
                        <p>6. In order to further hold our feet to the fire, the conference decided
                            that its final decision-making sessions would take place in New York for
                            eight weeks beginning 8 March and the conference ordered the Secretary
                            General of the United Nations to arrange for the signature of the final
                            action in Caracas in early September 1982. It is our belief that if
                            negotiations occur next year and we are active participants with a
                            position which is widely perceived to be tough but reasonable, this <pb
                                facs="0439" n="393" xml:id="pg_393"/> schedule could be postponed
                            until 1983. This view has been privately conveyed to us by the
                            coordinator of the Group of 77’s Contact Group on Seabed Mining
                                Issues.<note n="8" xml:id="d130fn8">Not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                        <p>7. To the extent there is any perception that the text has a slightly
                            higher status than before, this tends to reinforce the navigational
                            provisions of the treaty in the event the conference ends without a
                            successful result.</p>
                        <p>8. We will be paying particular attention this week to the working out of
                            the work program for the next session of the conference to insure that
                            we are not faced with difficult or artificial deadlines which could
                            hamper our negotiating leverage if our final decision is to renegotiate
                            the convention.</p>
                        <p>9. We have consulted with all of our Western allies who agree that the
                            conference decision is an excellent result for fulfilling the collective
                            wishes of the CG–5. Moreover, because the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> completely mishandled the debate over this conference

                                session. As a result they publicly supported continued progress on
                                outstanding issues and formalization of the text at this session.
                                Privately they told us they would not create obstacles for the
                                dialogue we sought and would not oppose us on substance. In the
                                final negotiations over formalization of the text they found
                                themselves isolated when the G–77 supported the compromise
                                arrangement worked out with us.” (Department of State, Central
                                Foreign Policy File, D810405–0781)</note> the final atmosphere at
                            the conference is that the US and the G–77 managed by working together
                            to develop an approach for the future which left the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in a corner, totally isolated from
                            the mainstream of the conference. The Soviet move in the debate was
                            sufficiently mismanaged so that by the end of the day yesterday, they
                            were forced publicly to concede that the Group of 77 did not want to
                            formalize the draft convention despite the strong push of the Eastern
                            European countries to do so. The Soviets persistent efforts to make
                            propaganda points with the G–77 have conclusively backfired to their
                            clear disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>10. The conference also decided not to extend this session into a fifth
                            week. The session will end on Friday, August 28.</p>
                        <p>11. On balance, the entire US delegation is quite satisfied with the
                            result.</p>

                        <p>1. (S) On 10 November 1981, a <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> adopted a draft Presidential Decision
                            Memorandum (<gloss target="#t_PDM_1">PDM</gloss>) for formal circulation
                            (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> It
                            is my opinion that the draft <gloss target="#t_PDM_1">PDM</gloss>
                            represents a fair evaluation of the issues. The paper characterizes the
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> view of the navigation/security
                            provisions of the Draft Convention as being “acceptable.” Any
                            deterioration of the present language of those provisions, however,
                            would of course render them unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss>. It should be noted that the position of the Department
                            of the Navy, as expressed by <gloss target="#t_SecNav_1">SecNav</gloss>
                            (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Dated November 4, attached but not
                                printed.</note> is that these provisions are only “barely, minimally
                            acceptable.” The position of the Air Force (Tab C),<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d131fn4">Dated November 9, attached but not printed.</note>
                            on the other hand, is much stronger in support of the treaty provisions.
                            As a balance between these two viewpoints, the characterization adopted
                            in the draft <gloss target="#t_PDM_1">PDM</gloss> was that the
                            provisions are “acceptable,” without positive or negative
                            qualifiers.</p>
                        <p>2. (S) Although the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> have not taken a
                            position yet, there appears to be no dispute within <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> that the seabed mining portion of the
                            text is unacceptable and should be amended. The draft <gloss
                                target="#t_PDM_1">PDM</gloss> takes this position.</p>
                        <p>3. (S) The draft <gloss target="#t_PDM_1">PDM</gloss> lays out two basic
                            options: (1) walk-away or, (2) continue negotiations with a view to
                            achieving substantial improvements to the seabed mining provisions. From
                            a <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> standpoint, Option II is
                            considered advantageous as it diminishes the likelihood that the
                            navigational articles will be unravelled at the next negotiating
                            session, and it offers an opportunity to obtain changes to the text that
                            will assure U.S. access to strategic minerals. The Department of State
                            has already taken a position in favor of Option II.<note n="5"

                                >LOS</gloss> draft convention. He suggested more realistic wording
                            and specific negotiating objectives in order to bring to an end
                            “continual talking, but no results.” Ambassador <persName

                                >LOS</gloss> Conference, defended the Memorandum, citing the
                            delicate negotiating situation and the need for cautious diplomacy if we
                            are to achieve our objectives. He emphasized that an initial policy
                            decision as to what should be the general US direction in these
                            negotiations is essential at this time. If Option 2 (to continue the

                            tactics will then be formulated. There was little support for Interior’s
                            overall position and only some limited wording changes were agreed to.

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>Since 1973, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has
                            been negotiating a treaty which would establish a legal regime covering
                            military and commercial navigation and overflight, deep seabed mineral
                            resource development, the extent and nature of coastal State
                            jurisdiction, fisheries conservation and management, marine scientific
                            research, prevention and control of ocean pollution, continental shelf
                            rights, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Conference was
                            expected to conclude negotiations and to open a treaty for signature in
                            1981.</p>
                        <p>Serious questions had been raised in the US, however, concerning the
                            adequacy of the Draft Convention, particularly with respect to the
                            regime it would establish for deep seabed mineral resource development.
                            The Republican Platform stated, “Multilateral negotiations have thus far
                            insufficiently focused attention on US long-term security requirements.
                            A pertinent example of this phenomenon is the Law of the Sea Conference,
                            where negotiations have served to inhibit US exploitation of the seabed
                            for its abundant mineral resources. Too much concern has been lavished
                            on nations unable to carry out seabed mining, with insufficient
                            attention paid to gaining early American access to it. A Republican
                            Administration will conduct multilateral negotiations in a manner that
                            reflects America’s abilities and long-term interest in access to raw
                            material and energy resources.”<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">See the

                        <p>In March, the US initiated a comprehensive review of its law of the sea
                            policy. The results of that review and an analysis of the available
                            options for pursuing US interests in law of the sea are summarized in
                            this memorandum. This memorandum does not address the issue whether the
                            US should sign or ratify any proposed treaty.</p>
                        <p>The next session of the Law of the Sea Conference will begin in March,
                            1982. The Conference expects to complete work on the draft text and
                            adopt the Law of the Sea Convention at that session.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS
                            OF THE INTERAGENCY REVIEW</p>
                        <p>In the course of the policy review, US interests and objectives in the
                            law of the sea have been examined. Against them, the Draft Convention
                            and “no-treaty” alternatives have been weighed. In addition, the
                            negotiability of improvements to the deep seabed mining regime has been
                            assessed.</p>
                        <p>The basic conclusions of the Interdepartmental Group (<gloss
                                target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss>) are that:</p>
                        <p>(1) The navigation and overflight provisions of the Draft Convention are
                            acceptable; any deterioration in the language of these provisions would,
                            however, render this portion of the draft treaty unacceptable. These
                            provisions, while not ideal from the United States point of view, would
                            be beneficial as they would provide a foundation for the exercise of
                            important naval and air mobility interests in a non-confrontational
                            manner. This assessment is, in part, predicated on the fact that the
                            Draft Convention provides for navigation and overflight freedoms,
                            including transit on, over, and under international straits overlapped
                            by territorial seas and archipelagic waters. Without these provisions,
                            the assertion of the freedoms guaranteed thereby would require a direct
                            challenge to existing territorial sea claims of 107 states, including
                            many of our allies. Unless international limitations are established,
                            the proliferation of excessive maritime claims almost certainly will
                            continue, thereby requiring costly levels of confrontation and certain
                            political-military risks to conduct routine peacetime military
                            operations. Ambiguities in the text regarding navigation and overflight
                            rights can be protected with interpretive statements and appropriate
                            exercise of our rights as we view them.<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The navigation provisions of the Draft Convention take on particular
                            importance for US commercial navigation interests. A widely accepted
                            treaty embodying the provisions of the current Draft Convention would
                            provide a more stable, predictable regime of maritime jurisdiction and
                            navigation rights that are essential to the smooth flow of maritime
                            commerce.</p>
                        <pb facs="0445" n="399" xml:id="pg_399"/>
                        <p>(2) The provisions of the treaty concerning marine scientific research,
                            the continental shelf, ocean energy production, and marine environmental
                            protection are generally consistent with US interests and objectives.
                            With respect to fisheries, the Department of State believes that US
                            interests would not be significantly affected one way or another by a
                            treaty, except for salmon and tuna where the effect would be adverse.
                            The Department of Commerce believes that, despite the treaty provisions
                            on tuna and salmon which in the short term provide less protection for
                            the US than our current legal positions, US fisheries interests would,
                            in the long run, be better served under a treaty.</p>
                        <p>(3) Major elements of the Draft Convention deep seabed mining regime are
                            clearly contrary to US interests and objectives.</p>
                        <p>(4) An effort to renegotiate the deep seabeds provisions of the Draft
                            Convention presents the only realistic possibility of achieving a law of
                            the sea treaty acceptable to the US. Returning to the Conference is the
                            only strategy or approach that has been identified which could prevent
                            deterioration of the navigational provisions while offering an
                            opportunity to achieve an acceptable deep seabed mining regime under the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>(5) The Conference is likely to open the Draft Convention for signature
                            in 1982, even if the US objects, unless the Conference believes that by
                            extending the deadline the US is likely to sign and ratify the treaty.
                            Most Conference participants, including virtually all of our allies, are
                            prepared to complete the Draft Convention with relatively little change.
                            Sixty countries are required to bring the treaty into force and there
                            are more than one hundred and twenty developing countries, many of whom
                            have strong interests in bringing the treaty into force. In the event
                            the treaty enters into force, it is impossible to assess with any degree
                            of confidence exactly who the parties to it might be and, therefore,
                            what effect entry into force would have on overall US interests if the
                            US were not a party.</p>
                        <p>(6) At one extreme, if a comprehensive treaty enters into force and the
                            United States is the only major nation which is not a party to the
                            treaty, commercial-scale deep seabed mining under US licenses almost
                            certainly would not occur on an unsubsidized basis because of serious
                            international legal and political risks.</p>
                        <p>At the other extreme, in the unlikely event that the treaty did not enter
                            into force for many of the nations interested in deep seabed mining (US,
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, France, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss>, Belgium, Japan, Netherlands, and Italy), the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, certain major developing countries,
                            and other industrialized countries, and provided that the US could
                            induce them to join in an alternative regime, investment in
                            commercial-scale deep seabed mining under US and foreign licenses might
                            occur under that regime.</p>
                        <pb facs="0446" n="400" xml:id="pg_400"/>
                        <p>A variety of cases lie between the two extremes outlined above. The
                                <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> cannot predict with a reasonable
                            degree of confidence whether commercial-scale investment would occur
                            under any such case. The various industrial consortia hold differing
                            views on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> has reached the following
                            additional conclusions with respect to negotiability:</p>
                        <p>(1) It would be extremely difficult to satisfy all US objectives listed
                            in Part IV below with respect to the deep seabed mining regime.
                            Nevertheless, there is an opportunity to seek and obtain substantial
                            improvements to the Draft Convention’s provisions on the deep seabed
                            mining regime. Such improvements could increase US and Western allied
                            influence in the decision-making process while, at the same time, they
                            could neutralize the one-nation, one-vote Assembly and could eliminate,
                            reduce, or mitigate the practical impacts of provisions which would
                            otherwise result in the implementation of the principles of the “New
                            International Economic Order” (<gloss target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss>).
                            They could also provide an investment climate for US industrial
                            development without subsidization. However, the improvements are
                            unlikely to alter the fact that the treaty would still be replete with
                                <gloss target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss> rhetoric which could still be
                            employed by developing countries to promote their aims in other
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(2) Negotiations to improve the deep seabed provisions can be conducted

                                OPTIONS FOR FUTURE US LAW OF THE SEA POLICY</hi></p>
                        <p>The Interagency Group proposes two options for consideration:</p>

                        <p>The Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Labor, State,
                            Transportation, and Treasury, and the Environmental Protection Agency,
                            and the National Science Foundation, recommend Option II. The Department
                            of Interior does not support Option II as presently drafted.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Option I: Withdraw from the Law of the Sea
                            Conference prior to the next session</p>
                        <p>This option would represent a determination that the draft law of the sea
                            treaty cannot be renegotiated in a manner that would satisfy US
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arguments In Favor of Option I:</p>
                        <p>—would demonstrate an American resolve not to participate in multilateral
                            negotiations in which the terms of the draft agreement <pb facs="0447"
                                n="401" xml:id="pg_401"/> (a) do not fairly reflect US political and
                            economic interests and financial contributions or (b) contain <gloss
                                target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss> principles which we find
                            unacceptable and which developing countries could employ to promote
                            their aims in other negotiations;</p>
                        <p>—because of the extreme character of this action, it might cause other
                            countries, including US allies, to rethink their commitment to the
                            treaty and eventually decide not to ratify the treaty;</p>
                        <p>—avoids the risk that US interests in deep seabed mining might be
                            compromised further through continued negotiation and might increase the
                            effectiveness of a US denunciation of objectionable provisions of the
                            treaty;</p>
                        <p>—would appeal to those Americans who feel that US interests should not be
                            subjected to majority votes by developing countries in international
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arguments Against Option I:</p>
                        <p>—would eliminate any realistic possibility of improving the Draft
                            Convention and would not capitalize on our currently strong bargaining
                            position;</p>
                        <p>—could lead to the unraveling of important navigational provisions to the
                            detriment of US security interests and, therefore, could reduce US
                            ability effectively to assert its minority view of navigation rights in
                            the face of adverse coastal state claims;</p>
                        <p>—would isolate the US from most other countries on this issue and provoke
                            substantial international controversy, including severe criticism from
                            US allies and others for walking away from the negotiating table;</p>
                        <p>—would be viewed as a major departure from the traditional US practice of
                            cooperating in efforts to reach multilateral solutions to foreign policy
                            issues thereby reducing US credibility as a reliable participant in
                            multilateral negotiations and possibly affecting other US foreign policy
                            goals adversely;</p>
                        <p>—would virtually eliminate any possibility of a US flag deep seabed
                            mining industry, unless the US could convince its allies and other key
                            countries not to ratify the treaty and to join an alternative regime.
                            Otherwise, investors likely would operate under a foreign flag pursuant
                            to the treaty, unless fully indemnified by the government against
                            risk;</p>
                        <p>—could result in US allies being unable to pursue and implement a
                            reciprocating states agreement with the US since they would stay in the
                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> negotiations and the US would
                            be seeking a permanent, alternative regime rather than a transitional
                            regime consistent with a law of the sea treaty;</p>
                        <p>—would offer the Soviets an opportunity to criticize the US in
                            international fora for using “high-handed” tactics;</p>
                        <pb facs="0448" n="402" xml:id="pg_402"/>
                        <p>—would be opposed by those Americans who do not believe the US should
                            walk out of negotiations and who favor multilateral solutions to major
                            world problems and an international rule of law.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Option II: Continue participation in the Law
                            of the Sea Conference to secure, through negotiations, the five
                            objectives set forth in Part IV</p>
                        <p>This option would commit the US to make a full effort to achieve
                            improvements in the deep seabeds provisions of the Draft Convention
                            sufficient to produce a treaty that could be signed and ultimately
                            ratified by the US. Detailed instructions for achieving these
                            objectives, including US positions on and proposed amendments to
                            specific treaty provisions will be developed for review by the Senior
                            Interdepartmental Group which includes all the relevant agencies. Any
                            agency differences will be forwarded no later than February 1 for
                            decision by the President.</p>
                        <p>To implement this option, it would be essential that the US state its
                            commitment to the multilateral treaty process. The US would have to
                            indicate that, if the renegotiated text meets its objectives, the US
                            Executive Branch would promote ratification. This commitment would not
                            prejudge the decision on whether to sign and ratify the final treaty
                            text. That would depend on a later decision on whether it meets US
                            objectives. If this option is selected, the US negotiating strategy
                            would be designed to minimize the risk that retaliatory measures would
                            be taken involving attempts to amend provisions of the treaty which are
                            favorable to US national security needs, while at the same time pursuing
                            strategies and tactical decisions which could result in a success under
                            Option II. Improvements consistent with US objectives in other areas
                            also may be sought if opportunities arise and if they could be achieved
                            without risking the unravelling of military navigation and other
                            important interests.</p>
                        <p>This approach carries no assurance that further negotiations would
                            satisfy US objectives. In the event that the US was successful in
                            achieving its objectives and decided to ratify the law of the sea
                            treaty, this would entail an appropriation by the US upon entry into
                            force of at least $300 million for financing the Enterprise and an
                            annual appropriation by the US of $5–10 million for the administrative
                            expenses of the Authority until it became self-financing. Whether
                            ratified or not, costs which are not now quantifiable would be
                            incurred.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arguments in Favor of Option II:</p>
                        <p>—presents the only realistic possibility of achieving a law of the sea
                            treaty that would be acceptable to the US or capable of obtaining the
                            Senate’s advice and consent. Returning to the Conference is the only
                            strategy or approach that has been identified which could reduce <pb
                                facs="0449" n="403" xml:id="pg_403"/> the risk of deterioration of
                            the navigation provisions while offering an opportunity to achieve an
                            acceptable deep seabed mining regime;</p>
                        <p>—would take maximum advantage of the negotiating leverage now available
                            to the US because of the review, would establish an optimum posture for
                            achieving an acceptable treaty, and could attract allied support;</p>
                        <p>—would be less likely than Option I to result in an unravelling of the
                            navigation provisions;</p>
                        <p>—would give the US greater credibility in any attempt to persuade its
                            allies not to participate in a treaty, if the final text is
                            unacceptable;</p>
                        <p>—would avoid the controversy and potential adverse effects on other
                            foreign policy areas which would be associated with withdrawal from the
                            Conference;</p>
                        <p>—would mean that, if after further negotiations in which the US
                            participates, the US decides not to sign or ratify the treaty and the
                            treaty enters into force, the treaty is still likely to be improved and
                            would benefit American companies which may decide to operate under the
                            flag of a treaty party;</p>
                        <p>—offers an opportunity to repair the very risky investment climate.</p>

                        <p>—may still result in a treaty which the US could not sign or ratify;</p>
                        <p>—involves returning to the negotiations and perhaps gaining concessions,
                            though inadequate, which likely would increase the political pressure,
                            both foreign and domestic, upon the US to sign the treaty and, if the US

                        <p>—would require US acquiescence in a negotiation involving (1) the
                            supervision and regulation by an international organization of the
                            development of deep seabed minerals; and (2) the creation of an

                            establish a deep seabed mining regime which satisfies the following
                            objectives. The US delegation is to regard the fulfillment of these
                            objectives as mandatory. Satisfying these objectives would among other
                            things, minimize the impact of <gloss target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss>
                            principles which could create adverse precedents for other negotiations.
                            Our objectives would be a treaty which:</p>
                        <p>—First, will not deter the development of any deep seabed mineral

                        <p>—Second, will assure national access to deep seabed mineral resources by
                            current and future qualified entities so as to enhance US <pb
                                facs="0450" n="404" xml:id="pg_404"/> security of supply, so as to
                            avoid monopolization of deep seabed mineral resources by the operating
                            arm of the International Authority, the Enterprise, and so as to promote
                            economic development of the resources.</p>
                        <p>—Third, will reserve for the US a decision-making role in the deep seabed
                            institution which fairly reflects the relative weight of US political
                            and economic interests and financial contributions, and effectively
                            protects them.</p>
                        <p>—Fourth, will not allow for amendments to enter into force without the
                            approval of the US, including advice and consent of the US Senate, and
                            will not set other undesirable precedents for international
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>—Fifth, will be such as to make it likely to receive the advice and
                            consent of the Senate if the President decides to support ratification.
                            (To this end, the treaty would not contain provisions that would create
                            serious political and commercial difficulties, including provisions for

                            delays. <hi rend="italic">However, we do not believe that either of

                        <p>It is essential that we have a decision on the law of the sea at the
                            earliest possible date. We have reached the point when further delays
                            will undercut seriously our ability to implement any presidential
                            decision. Although the next session of the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> Conference does not begin until March 8, it is crucial
                            that we have time to begin to lay the ground work for whatever strategy
                            is chosen. The Conference resumes work in the drafting committee on
                            January 18. Formal intersessional negotiations which would be crucial to
                            a renegotiation effort are scheduled to begin on February 24. Informal
                            contacts with conference leaders would have to be made before then.</p>

                            and added a sixth option (included as option 4) which we believe best
                            reflects the State Department and interagency views. All these options

                            <p>After a year of inter-agency review, all departments and agencies,
                                including senior White House staff, have reviewed US interests,
                                    objec<pb facs="0459" n="413" xml:id="pg_413"/>tives and options
                                at the Law of the Sea Conference. The <gloss target="#t_IG_1"
                                    >IG</gloss> has forwarded an option paper to the White House,
                                which sets forth two principal options for Presidential
                                    decision.<note n="6" xml:id="d136fn6">See <ref target="#d133"
                                        >Document 133</ref>.</note> The first is to withdraw from
                                the Conference and attempt to put in place an alternative regime to
                                the one being negotiated at the Law of the Sea Conference. The
                                second option is to continue to negotiate as effectively as possible
                                with a view toward improving the Law of the Sea treaty so as to make
                                it acceptable to the Administration and the Senate. All agencies
                                have agreed that the second option best protects US interests. The
                                Department of Interior believes however, that the second option
                                should contain a clearly delineated bottom line.</p>
                            <p>There is, however, a view held by some that it is impossible for the
                                US to achieve an acceptable treaty at the Law of the Sea Conference
                                and that particular attention should be paid to contingency
                                    strategies.<note n="7" xml:id="d136fn7">See <ref target="#d134"

                                address those strategies and to ensure that senior decision makers
                                have an opportunity to consider them in connection with the decision
                                memorandum which was prepared by the interagency group.</p>
                            <p>All agencies would agree that strategies need to be prepared if the
                                US fails to improve the treaty sufficiently to sign and seek
                                ratification. The precise issue addressed by this paper is whether
                                one could conclude <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that the result of
                                further negotiation at the Law of the Sea Conference has a high risk
                                of failure and consequently whether to adopt and implement
                                immediately strategies to deal with that contingency.</p>

                            <p>1. Immediate withdrawal from the Conference with our allies.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Commentary:</p>
                            <p>a. While no effort has been made at the highest levels to seek allied
                                withdrawal from the Conference, at this stage, all of our senior
                                experts and experienced observers believe this to be impossible. Our
                                allies have other law of the sea interests to protect and are
                                concerned with their relationships with developing countries. As a
                                result, they will simply not walk out.</p>
                            <p>b. If our allies could somehow be convinced to withdraw from the
                                Conference with us, the next step would be to try to set up an
                                alternative regime for seabed mining. However, the highest
                                probability is that <pb facs="0460" n="414" xml:id="pg_414"/> most
                                of the rest of the world, including many Western countries, will
                                proceed to set up a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and an
                                international organization to regulate seabed mining. Mining rights
                                would be in serious legal doubt and mining would be unlikely to
                                occur until there was either a negotiated settlement between the two
                                competing regimes or final international ajudication. Our chances of
                                winning an international ajudication are highly problematical.</p>
                            <p>c. Walking away now would leave the Soviets at the table with the
                                Third World, giving them a windfall opportunity to influence the
                                Conference in ways adverse to national security and economic
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>2. Immediate withdrawal without our allies.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Commentary:</p>
                            <p>a. This action would almost certainly produce in 1982 an adopted
                                treaty more or less in its present form. We would then have to
                                persuade our allies <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to sign it. This
                                might be easier to do than getting them to withdraw from the
                                Conference since, if we reject the treaty, the financial burdens
                                normally carried by the U.S. would have to be carried by our allies.
                                They might be reluctant to assume this burden. Nevertheless, the
                                other criticisms of strategy 1 still pertain and seabed mining might
                                not occur.</p>
                            <p>3. Negotiate with the intention of preserving our ideological
                                positions on <gloss target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss> issues and then

                            <p>a. This approach would involve taking a public posture that lays out
                                our maximum ideological position. It would be designed to force the
                                conference to agree on a system that is consistent with US
                                principles. Such an approach would be perceived by most countries as
                                a US decision not to engage in serious negotiation. The conference
                                would undoubtedly conclude we are seeking to have our position
                                rejected so as to give us a viable excuse for walking out. In
                                practice this approach would be the equivalent of the second
                                strategy and is, therefore, subject to the same criticism.</p>
                            <p>b. This strategy would foreclose the option of improving the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>4. Negotiate with the intention of preserving our option not to sign
                                and participate in the treaty.</p>

                            <p>a. This approach would involve a maximum effort to negotiate a treaty
                                that meets US interests and minimizes objectionable <gloss
                                    target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss> principles. It would be designed
                                to preserve non-deep seabeds provisions that we support. It would
                                probably result in important improvements to the treaty, but they
                                could still fall short of acceptability to the <pb facs="0461"
                                    n="415" xml:id="pg_415"/> US. Without a significant change in
                                present views, this is the only approach our allies appear to be
                                prepared to support.</p>
                            <p>b. This approach assumes that the US will decide later whether to
                                sign the resulting treaty. If we do not sign, a strategy could then
                                be attempted to discourage our allies from signing and to establish
                                an alternative regime. (See strategy 6).</p>
                            <p>c. This approach will enable us to conclude with our allies the
                                interim reciprocal regime which we have been negotiating. They have
                                made it clear that they would not sign such an agreement if the US
                                withdraws from the negotiation.</p>
                            <p>5. Negotiate with the intention not to sign.</p>

                            <p>a. This strategy could result in modest improvements to the treaty.
                                It is, however, subject to the criticism, should such a decision
                                become known in advance, of placing the US in a position of
                                negotiating in bad faith. No one believes that this decision could
                                be taken without the risk of it leaking or becoming obvious to other
                                negotiators, and it therefore could greatly impair the stature and
                                respect of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>

                            <p>6. Negotiate at the Law of the Sea Conference in a serious effort to
                                make significant improvements to the treaty, while at the same time
                                negotiating with our allies to produce a reciprocating states regime
                                or mini-treaty, which could serve as an alternative, if our efforts
                                at the Conference failed to produce an adequate result.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Commentary:</p>
                            <p>a. The first stage of this strategy is being pursued right now
                                through the reciprocal regime negotiations. It has been made clear
                                to us by our allies that the US must be a <hi rend="italic">bona
                                    fide</hi> participant at the Law of the Sea Conference and must
                                be seriously and reasonably attempting to repair the law of the sea
                                treaty (i.e., that the US pursue Option II as described in the
                                decision memorandum).<note n="8" xml:id="d136fn8">See <ref
                                        target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> Moreover, our
                                allies have stressed that they are only willing to participate in a
                                reciprocating states regime that is interim to a law of the sea
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>b. It is also open to question whether, if the Law of the Sea
                                Conference ultimately fails from our perspective, an elaborated
                                reciprocal regime or mini-treaty would adequately protect our deep
                                seabed mining interests. Most developing countries, the Eastern bloc
                                and many Western countries are still likely to create an
                                International Seabed <pb facs="0462" n="416" xml:id="pg_416"/>
                                Authority with regulatory power over deep seabed resources. This
                                strategy is therefore subject to the same criticism as preceding
                                strategies.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                            <p>It may not be possible to protect fully US interests with any of
                                these strategies. Strategies 4 and 6 offer the best opportunities to
                                satisfy US interests. They are essentially similar but have been
                                presented separately for the purpose of highlighting analysis of our
                                ability to establish an alternative regime.</p>
                            <p>If our sole or primary interest is to avoid US participation in a
                                treaty which accelerates or enhances international acceptance of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NIEO_1">NIEO</gloss> concepts and we do not
                                place importance on the viability of our future capacity to mine
                                deep seabed resources under the US flag, and if we are not seriously
                                concerned with world opinion, then most of these strategies will
                                work. Strategy 5, however, would subject the US to the legitimate
                                criticism of negotiating in bad faith, would undoubtedly become
                                known, and should therefore be rejected.</p>
                            <p>Strategies 4 or 6 appear to be prerequisite to implementing any of
                                the other strategies. The other strategies will be equally available
                                after the next session of the Law of the Sea Conference and could be
                                addressed at that time. In any case, none of them except for
                                unilateral withdrawal could be implemented in the time remaining
                                before the Law of the Sea Conference begins in early March.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clark</persName></hi> introduced the subject and called on
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to present the
                            basic issues.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName></hi> noted that there was no question that the deep
                            seabed provisions in the draft convention are unacceptable and that, if
                            they are not repaired, we could not sign or ratify the convention. The
                            issue today was whether to go ahead in the negotiations and, if so, what
                            would be the modalities of our participation. There is bureaucratic
                            consensus on returning to the Law of the Sea Conference and failure <pb
                                facs="0467" n="421" xml:id="pg_421"/> to return would be a serious
                            and self-defeating step. We might lose navigation provisions that are in
                            our interests and, although not ideal, are acceptable. An erosion of
                            them would be bad. We may also lose by getting no U.S. mining industry.
                            No one will support us if we withdraw from the conference and pulling
                            out would undercut our chances of getting an alternative regime.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that he could not agree more
                            that we should go back to the conference and negotiate. He noted that he
                            had read the interagency study<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> and it is clear that
                            some provisions of the draft convention are in our interest and good.
                            But we need to make clear what is unacceptable and what is acceptable in
                            the draft. We have to be clear on those points.</p>

                                    >Weinberger</persName></hi> added that the draft treaty has some
                            value and we should not withdraw.</p>

                                    >Smith</persName></hi> noted that we will need a very tough and
                            strong negotiator.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1"
                                >Watt</persName></hi> said he was delighted with the decision to go
                            back to the negotiations, but wanted to clarify how we would negotiate.
                            We need written instructions with clear, bottom-line positions now and
                            then should walk out of the conference if it did not accept these
                            positions. He said we expect to have problems only in the seabed regime
                            area.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he differed on one point. We do
                            have a bottom line in terms of knowing where we stand and what we want,
                            but we do not walk out. We sit and negotiate. If the other guy wishes,
                            he can walk out.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            said that it is critical not to have a treaty come back here that is
                            unacceptable. That would put the onus on the United States and the
                            President for turning it down.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> agreed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName></hi> said we need to consult with our allies
                            without any rigid instructions. We need to be firm, but we cannot
                            demand. We are negotiating, not demanding as <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJG_1">Jim Watt</persName> indicates we should do. We
                            will do what the President wants but will do it in a way that can
                            achieve our goals and bring success.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName></hi> responded that there would be no problem in
                            working out more details and coming back with more detailed instructions
                            after consultations with our allies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1"
                                    >Kirkpatrick</persName></hi> said we need to keep in mind that
                            this is in a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> framework, where we are
                            always playing against a stacked deck. The allies are not supportive now
                            and will not be later. They will be willing to accept the treaty and we
                            will be essentially alone. Unremitting pressure will be on us from the
                            very beginning. We need to be clear that there is something worse than
                            no treaty at all and that would be accepting the treaty basically as
                            is.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            noted that we will have another shot or two at the matter, and that we
                            should work on bottom lines now.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            reiterated that the deep seabed regime is not acceptable and we will let
                            our allies know that. However, we need flexibility now in working out
                            our strategy on how to get what we want in consultations with our
                            allies. Then we would develop specific instructions and know more
                            specifically what we can expect to achieve.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted that you have to have some
                            bottom lines—although that does not mean making them public—and some
                            give in negotiating positions. But the main thing is to know what points
                            are not acceptable. We do not like the seabed organization the way it
                            is; we know that and we need to know the problems. There are a variety
                            of ways of fixing it as long as we are clear on what the problems
                            are.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary Baldridge</hi> said that he liked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName>’s approach. He added
                            that the United States has been highly dependent on imports for several
                            major minerals and that we should be leaders in the technology for these
                            items.</p>

                        <p>I have reviewed the interagency report on United States Law of the Sea

                                    133</ref>.</note> along with the agencies’ recommendations, and
                            have decided that:</p>
                        <p>• The United States will continue to participate in the negotiations at
                            the Law of the Sea Conference. (U)</p>
                        <p>• United States objectives in these negotiations will be a treaty
                            that:</p>
                        <p>(a) will not deter development of any deep seabed mineral resources to
                            meet national and world demand; (U)</p>
                        <p>(b) will assure national access to these resources by current and future
                            qualified entities to enhance U.S. security of supply, to avoid
                            monopolization of the resources by the operating arm of the
                            International Authority and to promote the economic development of the
                            resources; (U)</p>
                        <p>(c) will give the United States a decision-making role in the deep seabed
                            regime that fairly reflects and effectively protects its political and
                            economic interests and financial contributions; (U)</p>
                        <p>(d) will not allow for amendments to come into force without United
                            States approval, including the advice and consent of the Senate; (U)</p>
                        <p>(e) will not set other undesirable precedents for international
                            organizations; and (U)</p>
                        <p>(f) will be likely to receive the advice and consent of the Senate. (In
                            this regard, the convention should not contain provisions creating
                            serious political or commercial difficulties, including provisions for
                            the mandatory transfer of private technology and participation by and
                            funding for national liberation movements.) (U)</p>
                        <p>• Fulfillment of these objectives shall be considered mandatory in the
                            negotiations. It is understood that the United States negotiating effort
                            will be based on the guidelines set forth in the interagency review.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>• United States negotiating strategy will make clear what aspects of the
                            current draft convention are unacceptable to the United States and will
                            be designed to achieve those changes necessary to fulfill all <pb
                                facs="0471" n="425" xml:id="pg_425"/> U.S. objectives and, pending
                            that, to avoid a move by the conference to complete its work and open a
                            convention for signature. (S)</p>
                        <p>Improvements consistent with United States interests in other areas shall
                            be sought if opportunities arise and if this can be accomplished without
                            risk to the military navigation and other important United States
                            interests. (C)</p>
                        <p>The United States will continue active negotiations with other countries
                            interested in deep seabed mining with a view to concluding a
                            reciprocating states agreement as early as possible on recognition of
                            deep seabed mining licenses. (U)</p>
                        <p>The United States will also continue to exercise its rights with respect
                            to navigation and overflight against claims that the United States does
                            not recognize in accordance with established procedures and review for
                            that program. (C)</p>

                            forth above after immediate consultation with key allies and, as
                            appropriate, other major participants in the conference. Any agency
                            differences shall be forwarded for my consideration by February 15,

                        <p>The State Department has forwarded for approval (Tab II) messages for the
                            President to send to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TM_1"
                                >Thatcher</persName> and to the heads of government of Italy,
                            France, Japan, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The messages urge
                            these prime ministers to support the U.S. position at the Law of the Sea
                                (<gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>) conference which will
                            reconvene early next month. (C)</p>
                        <p>As you recall, the United States has decided that the deep seabed mining
                            provisions of the present <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty
                            are inadequate, and we will be seeking to renegotiate them. The support
                            of the other industrialized nations is essential. We understand that
                            most of these governments will be making their decisions on whether or
                            not to support us in the next week or two, so it is important for the
                            President’s message to arrive in the next few days. (C)</p>

                        <p>2. The following letter was delivered today to Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName> by <gloss target="#t_UK_1"

                        <p>Begin text.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> is anxious that there should be as
                            many signatures as possible to the multilateral agreement and we would
                            wish, if it is at all possible, that France should be an initial
                            signatory.</p>
                        <p>If there is a prospect of France being a signatory there would be
                            advantage in deferring signature until after the forthcoming session of
                                <gloss target="#t_UNLOSC_1">UNLOSC</gloss> (ie until early May).</p>
                        <p>We understand that the closing of the “window” for PEE applications
                            (which is the significant element) can, under US law, be deferred until
                            mid-May, but that the United States administration apprehend political
                            difficulties in deferment. The assessment of those political
                            difficulties is naturally a matter for judgment on the part of the
                            United States authorities. We would, however, urge upon them the
                            advantages of a delay which might bring in not only France but also one
                            or more of the other like-minded states (Italy and Belgium).</p>
                        <p>We are aware of the argument that the conclusion of the reciprocating
                            states agreement will give weight to the negotiating position of the
                            industrialised countries in the forthcoming session of <gloss
                                target="#t_UNLOSC_1">UNLOSC</gloss>, particularly over <gloss
                                target="#t_PIP_1">PIP</gloss>. However, the strength of this
                            argument depends on the number of industrialised countries
                            participating. If there is a deferment of signature, unity on <gloss
                                target="#t_PIP_1">PIP</gloss> will be the greater, and therefore
                            potential more impressive, because it may be expected that all the
                            like-minded states will hold together on that issue and there will be no
                            division to be exploited between those who have signed the agreements
                            and those who have shown their unwillingness to do so. The latter would
                            then have no cause to demonstrate that they have desisted because of
                            concern over limitations.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the G77 appear to expect the agreements to be signed at this
                            time and a deferment of signature would remove what the G77 <pb
                                facs="0474" n="428" xml:id="pg_428"/> would consider an affront.
                            This can only assist the United States in its negotiations on part
                            XI.</p>

                        <p>Dear Al,</p>
                        <p>As you know, France cannot consider signing reciprocity agreements on
                            international seabed exploration if such agreements lead to a monopoly
                            of beds rich in polymetallic nodules by the industrialized countries and
                            to a breakdown of the Conference on the Law of the Sea.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, you stated that consortiums which had already engaged
                            in exploration work would only apply for and obtain permits for limited
                                areas.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">Telegram 344245 to Paris,

                            provided that France made it known in an Agreed Minute that it cannot
                            consent to the monopoly of the nodule-rich seabeds and had been given
                            the possibility, in the event of a monopoly, of denouncing the
                            agreements without notice or on very short notice. On January 28, 1982,
                            therefore, I wrote you that I concurred in the terms of a text that our
                            negotiators had agreed on ad referendum, and I added that I did not
                            contemplate any major changes therein.<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">Not

                        <p>It became quite evident during the most recent negotiating session on

                            permits for areas clearly exceeding the 150,000 or even, in certain
                            cases, the 200,000 square kilometers we had considered to be the maxium.
                            The agreed minute has consequently been revised to allow the states to
                            express their differing opinions. More important, a clause has been
                            added at the request of your representative in order to specify that
                            this agreed minute shall in no way affect or prejudice the rights and
                            obligations of the parties pursuant to the agreement, to international
                            law, or to their domestic law.</p>
                        <p>These changes clearly reveal our divergent views and will thus make it
                            more difficult to defend our common interests at the Conference on the
                            Law of the Sea. Furthermore, these changes lead me to believe that the
                            requests from the consortiums will be of such magnitude that there will
                            be a serious risk of monopoly and a consequent breakdown of the
                            conference.</p>

                        <p>Under these conditions, I would consider it preferable to postpone the
                            conclusion of our negotiations to a later date when the consortiums will
                            be better able to determine their requests and the governments better
                            able to weigh the chances of success of the conference.</p>

                                provoke strong reaction from the G–77 and others (including possibly
                                France and Japan). I believe, however, that by delaying the internal
                                processing of applications until after the end of the resumed <gloss
                                    target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> session, signing now will not
                                significantly affect my ability to achieve the President’s
                                objectives in the Law of the Sea negotiations</hi>. <gloss
                                target="#t_EB_1">EB</gloss> feels that the failure of the G–77 to
                            make an important issue of reciprocating states during the
                            intersessional is evidence that a reciprocating states arrangement will
                            not cause great difficulty at the Conference.</p>
                        <p>If the US agreed to delay signature now, there is no guarantee that the
                            G–77 as well as the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> would not seek a further delay in May,
                            particularly if a further session were scheduled in August.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, indications that the US was considering postponement
                            of signature of <hi rend="italic">the Agreement now have provoked strong
                                criticism from the US deep seabed mining industry, key elements in
                                Congress and conservative groups</hi>. The mining industry feels
                            that early signature would best promote the continued viability of the
                            pioneer US mining industry and would establish the basic legal framework
                            for an alternative mining regime which might later be expanded to
                            include other parties. They believe that delay in signature may be
                            interpreted at the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Conference as a
                            signal of lack of US determination to protect our seabed mining
                            interests and that the Agreement may never be signed if further
                            concessions are made to the G–77. <hi rend="italic">The industry would

                            the other industrialized countries to produce a joint proposal on
                            preparatory investment protection which is one of the outstanding issues
                            at the conference. These negotiations were completed on Friday night and
                            the proposal will be co-sponsored by Japan, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"

                            France has elected to remain out for the time being. The U.S. delegation
                            prepared in response to Group of 77 requests a book of amendments which
                            would fully carry out the objectives outlined by the President in his

                            presented to the conference today. Limited reactions from the Group of
                            77 have been obtained. All agree the U.S. amendments will not be
                            accepted in their totality. Many delegations want to find a way of
                            working with the United States in a constructive manner. Some
                            delegations notably Brazil, are attempting to obtain unified G77
                            opposition to the entire package, because of the Brazilian desire to
                            force technology transfer to developing countries. We have no
                            negotiating instructions to accommodate the Brazilians.</p>

                            on maintaining the conference timetable though this may largely be a
                            negotiating ploy to keep our feet to the fire and to force us to reduce
                            our demands at an early stage. In general, the conference has reacted
                            favorably to the style of our presentations and many delegations have
                            told us that this is making it easier to digest what is otherwise a very
                            tough position for them to accept.</p>
                        <p>4. Our allies for the most part have been supportive. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is obviously being careful not to
                            overly incite the G77.</p>
                        <p>5. Next week we will hear G77 reactions to our book of amendments. There
                            will probably be a short period of upset within the conference while
                            leadership attempts to find a suitable negotiating forum in which the
                            G77 leaders and the industrialized countries can begin serious
                            discussions on the issues raised by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. At this stage there is no reason to have anything more than guarded
                            hope, but all things considered we are apparently off to a good start
                            under very difficult circumstances.</p>

                        <p>G77 gave careful reply by De Soto (Peru) the Chairman of the Group of 77,
                            to U.S. amendments package today specifying a number <pb facs="0481"
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435"/> of issues on which they felt U.S.
                            amendments were contrary to the position of the G77. They were silent,
                            however, on some issues of considerable importance to the U.S.,
                            including our proposed amendment to obtain blocking power on important
                            Council decisions. The basic thrust of the G77 intervention was that the
                            U.S. book of amendments cannot itself be the basis for negotiation on
                            Part XI<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">Part XI established an International
                                Seabed Authority to permit mining and distribute royalties for

                                Zone.</note> but also making it clear that the G77 is not closing
                            the door on further negotiation on the underlying issues which have been
                            raised by the U.S. The G77 statement implied that if the U.S. proposals
                            were supported by a group of states they might be viewed even more
                            seriously. Indeed, a group of ten countries—Australia, Austria, Canada,
                            Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway and
                            Sweden—have undertaken to provide compromise proposals to the United
                            States amendments. They are using President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName>’s objectives as set forth in his statement of
                            January 29 as the basis for their work. The Conference leadership in its
                            search for an informal intermediary has given encouragement to this
                            effort to develop compromise proposals as a vehicle for further
                            negotiations. We will monitor and guide this effort to the extent
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Except for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and China, the
                            remaining speakers this morning were industrialized countries who gave
                            strong support to the U.S. proposals—the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss>, Belgium (presently serving as President of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>), and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>. We anticipate similar expressions of support from
                            Japan, France, and Italy who will speak this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and China generally condemned
                            the book of amendments as being non-negotiable, although the tone of
                            their remarks was milder than their previous statements since the
                            announcement of the U.S. <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> policy
                            review.</p>
                        <p>By the end of today it should be obvious to the G77 that the U.S. has
                            strong support from the major western industrialized countries and that
                            therefore the G77 has very little choice but to find a way to commence
                            active negotiation on the issues raised by the U.S.</p>

                                Malone</persName>, who is leading the delegation at <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_RLS_1">Leigh Ratiner</persName> as a Special
                            Ambassador for the Conference. This proposal has run into significant
                            opposition, and has diverted a significant amount of Jim’s time from the
                            Conference itself. For this reason, he called today and requested that
                            we set up a meeting as soon as possible to resolve the issue, one way or
                                another.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">No record of a meeting has been

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> is a solid political
                            appointee who shares the President’s philosophy. However, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RLS_1">Ratiner</persName>, an attorney and consultant
                            for the State Department, who is serving as <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                >Malone</persName>’s closest adviser, is another matter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RLS_1">Ratiner</persName> is very able,
                            manipulative, intelligent, and probably has about the best grasp of the
                            issues and the players of anyone who has been involved in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> process. He has been involved in many
                            previous negotiations, has served in government for awhile, and
                            successfully represented the groups opposing U.S. signature of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Moon Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, it is unclear for what <persName corresp="#p_RLS_1"
                                >Ratiner</persName> is working. He has no clear ideology, no open
                            personal agenda, no apparent loyalty to anyone or anything. It is not
                            clear that he has any principled, or even pragmatic, objection to the
                            current draft treaty. Instead, the negotiations simply appear to be a
                            game to be “won.”</p>
                        <p>He is also distrusted by some foreign delegations, some members of the
                            U.S. delegation, a number of conservative Congressmen, and, in
                            particular, the U.S. mining industry. There is some reason to believe
                            that he may have helped thwart the reciprocating states negotiations,
                            which probably could have been signed a few weeks ago, but which now
                            will remain unsigned by the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> for the duration of the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <pb facs="0483" n="437" xml:id="pg_437"/>
                        <p>I am also very concerned that Leigh is now setting the stage for a
                            request to loosen up the instructions—that is, to allow him flexibility
                            in proposing concessions. If such a request comes, it should be
                            rejected.</p>
                        <p>Because of <persName corresp="#p_RLS_1">Ratiner</persName>’s reputation,
                            and the intense political opposition to him by our political and
                            industrial allies, I don’t believe that his appointment as Special
                            Ambassador would serve the President’s political interest.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d146fn3"><persName corresp="#p_RLS_1">Ratiner</persName> did
                                not receive the rank of Ambassador.</note> Because of his lack of
                            obvious commitment to the principles and interests of the
                            Administration, I don’t believe that it would serve the President’s
                            policy interest.</p>
                        <p>However, failure to bestow the rank upon him will likely lead him to
                            leave the delegation (at least, that is his claim; he may be posturing,
                            as he is a master of negotiation). Though contingency plans are in place
                            in case he does leave, his departure would definitely affect the ability
                            of the delegation to negotiate, if only in the short-term. It is unclear
                            how costly this would be, since the developing countries have rejected
                            our proposed amendments, and there is precious little room for us to
                            compromise whoever is masterminding the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In any case, it is imperative that we get this issue resolved as soon as
                            possible. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> has requested
                            that the decision be made at the highest levels possible, and that he
                            have an opportunity to discuss the pros and cons, which are, I believe,
                            reasonable requests. He is willing to fly here today, tomorrow, or
                            whenever he is needed; he is also willing to bring <persName

                        <p>I recommend that a meeting be scheduled with <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1"

                        <p>The United States’ amendments fully reflecting your objectives have been
                            widely read and analyzed.<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">See <ref

                        <p>The President of the Conference has fostered a group of 11 non-G–77
                            countries to draw up compromise proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3"
                                >In telegram 75114 to the Naval Station in Charleston, South
                                Carolina, March 20, the Department reported that the U.S. amendments
                                had been rejected and that 11 nations were drafting compromise
                                proposals—Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Sweden,
                                Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Austria, and the Netherlands. (Department
                                of State, Central Foreign Policy File, D820150–0261)</note> These
                            proposals show some encouraging movement towards the U.S. position in
                            some areas—guaranteed U.S. Council seat, technology transfer, and a
                            system of awarding mining contracts—covered by our amendments but omit
                            many of the key issues.</p>
                        <p>We have said these proposals cannot be considered as an exhaustive agenda
                            of the issues for negotiation, and therefore do not form the basis for
                            renegotiation of Part XI.</p>
                        <p>A key leader of the G–77<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> has made the following points: (1) they are
                            moving to formalize the treaty text in about ten days; (2) they believe
                            they are better off adopting the convention even if the U.S. and its
                            allies stay out since they will then at least have a convention, which
                            will stifle deep seabed mining investment and the West will be forced to
                            negotiate with the G–77 again in the future; (3) they regard this as
                            preferable to reaching an accommodation with the U.S. now which would
                            require major sacrifices of principles; (4) they had hoped the U.S.
                            would allow its allies to negotiate reasonable amendments so as to
                            enable a future U.S. administration to accede. Whether these points were
                            made for tactical purposes or whether they fairly reflect the
                            substantive position of the G–77 is not clear.</p>
                        <p>We are making every effort possible to get G–77 agreement to an agenda
                            for negotiations which would include all of your objectives. <pb
                                facs="0485" n="439" xml:id="pg_439"/> Even with an acceptable
                            agenda, achieving your six objectives will be extremely difficult.</p>
                        <p>The allies are still the key to our success at the conference. They are
                            supporting our efforts to obtain an acceptable agenda. It is not clear,
                            however, how long and how strongly they will continue to support us. The
                            intensity of their support will be tested shortly.</p>
                        <p>In any event, it is likely negotiations will occur only in an eleventh
                            hour brinkesmanship atmosphere. In view of the dynamics of the
                            situation, it is important that the U.S. be able to move quickly in
                            response to any demonstrated flexibility of the G–77.</p>

                            said the U.S. was attempting to resolve the immediate procedural
                            problems by getting agreement to negotiate all issues of concern to the
                            U.S. He indicated that developments in the last few days were somewhat
                            encouraging and could lead to useful negotiations,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d148fn2">In telegram 765 from New York, March 27, <gloss
                                    target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> reported: “General mood of
                                Conference leadership is now becoming optimistic. This attitude,
                                however, may be founded on an assumption that when the crunch comes
                                the U.S. will moderate its demands somewhat. If we were to dash
                                these hopes right now it would create a climate at the Conference
                                for going ahead rapidly without serious negotiations with the U.S.”
                                (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D820164–0024)</note> although the Group of 77 still insists that
                            negotiations must end by April 30. There remains a risk that, if the
                            negotiations deteriorate, important provisions in the draft treaty could
                            be changed to the detriment of U.S. navigation and security interests.
                            The Secretary directed that contingency plans be prepared in case the
                            G–77 attempts to press the treaty to a vote before compromises are
                            reached. The Secretary directed that all appropriate Department of State
                            assets be used if necessary to persuade other nations to support the
                            U.S. in these negotiations.</p>

                            like to give you my thoughts on where we now stand.</p>
                        <p>It appears that in the next two weeks, it may be possible to make
                            considerably more progress toward meeting your objectives announced on
                            January 29 than we had thought previously.</p>
                        <p>While the developing countries are being very cautious, there are now
                            many indications of their willingness to make a number of changes to the
                            Treaty which move toward meeting your objectives. These changes would
                            include new provisions concerning the powers of the one-nation one-vote
                            Assembly, technology transfer, the contract approval system, grandfather
                            rights for existing investors and a guaranteed U.S. seat on the Council.
                            We are somewhat less encouraged but still hopeful concerning prospects
                            for negotiating acceptable solutions to the problems of the adoption of
                            amendments to the Treaty by the Review Conference.</p>
                        <p>In two areas, however, the situation presently appears to be
                            unpromising:</p>
                        <quote><p>—complete elimination of production ceilings on Seabed material
                                production from the Treaty, and;</p>
                            <p>—achievement of a voting system on the Council of the International
                                Seabed Authority which would allow the U.S. and a few of our Western
                                allies to affirmatively impose certain decisions.</p></quote>

                        <p>These two areas are not specifically mentioned in your January 29

                            achieve your stated objectives.</p>

                                >See <ref target="#d150">Document 150</ref>.</note> to review the
                            delegation Chairman’s written report and assessment of prospects for
                            achieving your objectives. If any serious agency differences arise out
                            of that meeting affecting your fundamental objectives you will need to
                            make decisions soon. The Conference is at a turning point and if we do
                            not demonstrate some flexibility in the above mentioned areas, the
                            developing countries, the Socialist countries and many of our Western
                            allies seem likely to adopt the present Treaty and open it for signature
                            in September in Caracas.</p>

                        <p>• We should not spend much leverage now on the terms and conditions for

                            out in the preparation of the rules and regulations that would follow

                        <p>• These areas were covered in the delegation’s instructions but are not
                            key to the President’s objectives, which are still mandatory.</p>
                        <p>All agencies justifiably disagreed with State’s proposal that we accept

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Conference President announced
                            today all amendments must be submitted by Tuesday, April 13. He stressed
                            that the application of the Rules of Procedure should not present an
                            obstacle to further <pb facs="0489" n="443" xml:id="pg_443"/>
                            negotiations, nor should it prevent adoption of the Convention by
                            consensus. We faced an emerging French-British initiative to submit
                            separate national amendments or amendments sponsored by the CG–5 minus
                            the U.S. Such amendments would fall far below the U.S. bottom-line and
                            would place any negotiating effort with the G–77 in serious jeopardy. We
                            have temporarily dissuaded French and British on the grounds that such a
                            course could terminate prospects for U.S. participation in the
                            Convention. It is clear, however, that each of our Allies will make a
                            judgment next week when the window for formal amendments closes, and if
                            they do not feel that promising negotiations are likely, they may
                            publicly split with the U.S. Agreement has been reached that
                            negotiations will begin on Thursday<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">April
                                8.</note> afternoon on preparatory investment protection. Following
                            conclusion of those negotiations, there will be a pause for the G–77 to
                            consider how to proceed. The G–77 have not agreed to negotiation with
                            the U.S. on any other issues, and indeed, have not been able to achieve
                            a consensus on which issues can be negotiated. There are indications
                            that there may be a two-thirds vote in favor of prior notification and
                            authorization for warships. This news greatly concerned <gloss

                            U.S. suggested adoption of the Convention by consensus which could be
                            done if the Soviets drop their objections to U.S. proposals. Kozyrev
                            replied that, if U.S. can agree to a resolution of council composition
                            and decisionmaking which does not disadvantage Soviets, they will assist
                            or not object to improvements U.S. is seeking in all other areas.</p>

                            delegation does not believe that <persName corresp="#p_KTT_1"

                            for several days and the delegation hopes to move rapidly to the

                            conference as a major reduction in U.S. demands but helped to signal
                            that the U.S., while remaining very tough, may in fact be willing to
                            participate in the adoption of the convention by consensus at this

                            weeks. They are not willing to discuss the U.S. amendments until they

                            idea are unavailing. <gloss target="#t_PIP_1">PIP</gloss> is likely to

                            indicated that some U.S. amendments could <pb facs="0492" n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446"/> be acceptable to them. In the KOH negotiating
                            group their attitude on <gloss target="#t_PIP_1">PIP</gloss> has been
                            generally constructive.</p>
                        <p>5. President <persName corresp="#p_KTT_1">Koh</persName> has told us that
                            no matter what the G 77 do, it is his intention to produce new texts on
                            the basis of discussion during the next few days. Based on his recent
                            behavior, he probably will introduce the results of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PIP_1">PIP</gloss> negotiations, the results of any Prep
                            Comm negotiations, and the G 11 papers. The G 77 may challenge his right
                            to do so but he has announced his willingness to let the issue be raised
                            in plenary as a procedural matter.</p>
                        <p>6. The G 77 leadership claim that they would prefer face-to-face
                            negotiations with the U.S. “at the appropriate time” and do not want
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTT_1">Koh</persName> to produce texts not
                            resulting from agreements reached in such negotiations. Their tactics in
                            the <gloss target="#t_PIP_1">PIP</gloss> negotiations, however, have
                            been to use up the available time for negotiations without reaching
                            other issues of concern to the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_KTT_1"
                                >Koh</persName> has said that he will hold meetings until next

                            outstanding issues and formal amendments. On Thursday<note n="6"

                            their final “recommendations” and then will use those texts as the basis
                            for the conference to decide, on April 23, whether all efforts to reach
                            consensus have been exhausted. If the answer is negative negotiations
                            could continue. For the moment there seems to be a determination to
                            continue negotiations and make every effort to reach consensus. The
                            chance that voting will begin therefore appears remote but the situation
                            remains highly unpredictable.</p>

                        <p>The polymetallic sulfide deposits recently discovered along rifts in the
                            sea floor of the eastern Pacific Ocean are a potentially large source of
                            copper, zinc, silver, gold, platinum, and gallium and a less important
                            source of other metals like iron, sulfur, and molybdenum. The current US
                            policy interest in this discovery relates primarily to the attempt of
                            some 150 nations at the Third <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Conference on the Law of the Sea (<gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1"
                                >UNCLOS</gloss> III) to forge a comprehensive treaty governing the
                            exploitation of ocean resources lying in international waters: This week
                            they will be discussing the moratorium on seabed mining that the United
                            States objects to. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The present Draft Convention was largely developed before the
                            polymetallic sulfide deposits were discovered and thus does not
                            adequately treat their exploitation. The United States is seeking to
                            revise the Convention to remove objectionable provisions concerning the
                            mining of polymetallic nodules. Unless precise language is crafted for
                            polymetallic sulfide mining, regulation would be left to unpredictable
                            action by the International Seabed Authority established by the
                            Convention, and exploitation of these resources would be hindered or
                            delayed. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Cost estimates for polymetallic sulfide mining can be nothing more than
                            guesses at this point because the technology for mining hard rock at
                            depths of 2,000 to 3,000 meters is not yet developed. If current
                            relative prices hold through the 1990s, only deposits with high gold,
                            silver, and platinum content are likely to be of commercial interest and
                            even these probably would not be mined before the turn of the century
                            and thus are not likely to impact soon on world metal markets. [<hi

                        <p>Early assays—and they are very preliminary—suggest that recovery of gold,
                            silver, platinum, and gallium, even from only one or two <pb facs="0494"
                                n="448" xml:id="pg_448"/> polymetallic sulfide deposits rich in
                            these metals, might disrupt one or more of their markets, lower prices,
                            and adversely affect South Africa and the Soviet Union if the deposits
                            are extensive. Markets for the other minerals mined would be much less
                            affected. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Polymetallic sulfide mining would help those countries, including the
                            United States, bordering the eastern Pacific. The West European
                            countries and Japan are not as favorably situated with respect to known
                            deposits, but might use their technological know-how in joint ventures

                            appear to be the leaders in deep sea exploration and may be seen as
                            possible leaders in mining polymetallic sulfide minerals. The United
                            States has an advantage in hard-rock mining and deepwater dredging

                        <p>Polymetallic sulfide deposits are of current interest primarily because
                            of the role they might play in the present Law of the Sea debates. If
                            the Conference does not craft a clear text on the mining of these
                            metals, a Draft Convention could go into the lengthy ratification
                            process without polymetallic sulfide mining rules and regulations. These
                            would have to be added by amendment later, and mining could be delayed
                            until their adoption. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>The US lead in hard-rock mining and deepwater dredging technologies might
                            afford it an important advantage in the exploitation of polymetallic
                            sulfide minerals. But environmental considerations are <pb facs="0495"
                                n="449" xml:id="pg_449"/> likely to discourage any processing of
                            these ores on the west coast, and transport to facilities in the
                            interior may be costly. The latter are old and themselves
                            environmentally troublesome. Metal markets have not been robust enough
                            to warrant costly pollution control programs, and copper and zinc
                            companies claim that they will close their smelters and refineries,
                            shifting this processing to other countries, rather than retrofit them.
                            If the more highly profitable ocean sulfide deposits are exploited, the
                            copper and zinc extracted as a byproduct might help revitalize these US
                            industries. Also, exploitation of polymetallic sulfide minerals could
                            considerably reduce or eliminate US dependence on imports of many of the
                            metals found in the deposits, including, in the case of platinum and
                            vanadium, a potentially dangerous reliance on South Africa and the
                            Soviet Union. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>The United States and its allies could find the Soviet Union a
                            well-prepared competitor in mining ocean sulfides. The Soviet Union is
                            largely self-sufficient in the metals found in the polymetallic sulfide
                            deposits. [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>] Moreover,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has also recently adopted a
                            slightly more favorable attitude toward US objections concerning the
                            current <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Draft Convention. There are
                            even indications that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might
                            not accede to the Convention unless the Western industrial countries and
                            Japan do so. At this time Moscow’s principal interest is probably to
                            preserve its options with respect to any minerals that might be
                            available from the seabed. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>The Soviet decree on seabed mining issued this week allows its
                            enterprises to stake claims to seabed mineral deposits lying in
                            international waters; prospecting and mining will not be allowed until 1
                            January 1988. By this act, the Soviets are putting themselves on an
                            equal footing with the industrial nations that have already adopted
                            similar national legislation. Now, Soviet firms may establish property
                            rights as Western firms may now do. If UNCLOs III fails to produce a
                            treaty, Moscow might join the West in a reciprocating-states agreement.

                            Conference took some new turns. The Conference President tried
                                Thursday<note n="3" xml:id="d155fn3">April 22.</note> night to
                            pressure us to accept four amendments, that fall way below our
                            objectives, and withdraw all our others. Otherwise, he said all the
                            pending amendments—including those that we oppose—will be brought to a
                            vote and possibly the convention as well.</p>
                        <p>All agencies agreed that we cannot give in to this kind of pressure. The
                            delegation also believes that we have a good chance of blocking
                            undesirable changes to the navigation provisions.</p>
                        <p>We are entering the “eleventh hour” of the Conference a little earlier
                            than expected. The Conference President appears to be looking for a way
                            to “square the circle” or how to bring the Conference to a close with a
                            number of amendments on the table. It is not clear how he will follow
                            through; he has already shifted ground a bit when it became clear
                                Friday<note n="4" xml:id="d155fn4">April 23.</note> morning that we
                            and some others would not withdraw amendments.</p>
                        <p>Although we decided that we would not force the convention to a vote and
                            risk changes to the provisions we like, that decision may be taken out
                            of our hands now since we cannot, even as a tactical matter, withdraw
                            all our amendments and appear to “cave in” completely. Our allies are
                            wavering in their support, as we expected they would when the Conference
                            gets tough.</p>

                            likely that at the end of this week we will face a revised treaty
                            produced at the last minute. <hi rend="italic">The new treaty will
                                likely contain improvements and changes which will require
                                analysis</hi>. This situation requires us to make two decisions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Should the US participate in consensus adoption of
                                the Convention</hi>?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Three alternatives are available</hi>: (a) the US could
                            join a consensus to adopt the Convention; (b) the US could decline
                            either to join or oppose consensus adoption; and (c) the US could object
                            to consensus adoption and insist on a vote.</p>
                        <pb facs="0498" n="452" xml:id="pg_452"/>
                        <p>Interim tactics aside, <hi rend="italic">the delegation sees no
                                sufficient advantage to be gained by forcing the Convention to be
                                adopted by a vote</hi>. Voting would demonstrate the firmness of US
                            views and convictions and would leave no inference of acceptance that
                            would impact politically on the development of customary international
                            law regarding seabed mining. On the other hand, <hi rend="italic">voting
                                could create some possible danger to navigation, overflight, and
                                other security aspects of the Convention</hi>. It also would likely
                                <hi rend="italic">result in a public split with the allies</hi>, who
                            probably would not vote against adoption of the Convention. This could
                            have serious implications for the Reciprocating State Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Joining a consensus gives the wrong signal assuming the President’s
                            objectives have not been met. <hi rend="italic">Refusal to oppose
                                consensus avoids risk to national security issues, preserves our
                                ability to</hi> pursue other options, and preserves unity with our
                            allies. Avoiding a vote would keep the door open for a Reciprocating
                            States Agreement.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Should the US make a public statement of our views
                                on the merits of the seabed mining aspects of the

                        <p>A public statement on the seabeds provisions would leave no inference
                            that the US was accepting the seabed mining provisions with possible

                                review the following:</p>
                            <p>• The convention adopted at the conference, particularly as it
                                relates to United States interests and the objectives set forth in
                                the President’s January 29 statement and directive.</p>
                            <p>• Steps and positions the United States should now consider taking to
                                best protect its Law of the Sea and other ocean interests. This
                                should include, in particular, analysis of both near-term and
                                longer-term approaches for the establishment of an alternative
                                arrangement for deep seabed mining among like-minded states, as well
                                as related questions on the positions of such key countries and
                                others toward the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty.</p>
                            <p>• Considerations pertaining to (1) signing the Final Act at Caracas
                                later this year, and (2) signing the convention and participating in
                                the Preparatory Commission.</p>
                            <p>Analysis of alternative courses of action with their advantages and
                                disadvantages should be included as appropriate. The review should
                                be considered by the Senior Interagency Group and forwarded for the
                                President’s consideration by June 16, 1982.</p>

                            for signature in December after the drafting work; we are pressing for

                                abstentions of the Netherlands, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                    >FRG</gloss>, Italy, Belgium as well as the <gloss

                                immediately press for completion of that Agreement. Japan is
                                interested in seabed mining. With the US out and others abstaining,
                                Japan may conclude that it should sign the Treaty, hoping that the
                                Treaty will prevail over a Reciprocating States Agreement and that
                                this will give Japan an advantage. The French may have a similar
                                view as well as other interests in staying with the G–77. However,
                                the French should not be counted out of an eventual Reciprocating
                                States Agreement.</p>
                            <p>The US lost nothing outside of the seabed provisions; the navigation,
                                overflight and other issues remain intact.</p>
                            <p>During July and August, there will be drafting sessions to complete
                                the technical review. During September 20–23, a Plenary Session will
                                approve the drafting work. The treaty will be open for signature in
                                Caracas in early December.</p>
                            <p>A full report will be prepared for you with recommendations on what
                                action should be taken on the treaty and what steps are necessary to
                                protect US oceans interests.<note n="4" xml:id="d159fn4">See <ref

                            <p>In the wake of the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention on April
                                30, 1982 over US objection, how should the US pursue its oceans

                                Venezuela). Seventeen countries abstained, including the <gloss

                                except Romania.</p>
                            <p>We did not achieve changes that satisfy any of the objectives for the
                                deep seabed mining regime set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1"
                                    >NSDD</gloss> 20 of January 29.<note n="6" xml:id="d162fn6">See
                                        <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> The text
                                adopted by the Conference contains eight minor changes to the
                                seabeds provisions, including an assurance of a permanent seat on
                                the Council for the US (if the US ratified the Convention and
                                continued to be the largest consumer of seabed minerals) but the
                                text otherwise remains essentially the same as that reviewed
                                earlier. The text did not include the many changes supported by the
                                US, including those assuring adequate protections of workers’ safety
                                and labor standards.</p>
                            <p>Consequently the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> assessment of

                                        >Document 133</ref>.</note> remains the same. The navigation
                                and overflight provisions of the Convention, although in part
                                troublesome, are acceptable in their present form. Other non-seabeds
                                provisions are, with certain limited exceptions, generally
                                consistent with US interests. The deep seabed mining regime contains
                                major elements contrary to US interests.</p>
                            <p>We were unable to effect significant improvements in the Convention
                                because of unyielding resistance on the part of the Group of 77,
                                which in effect refused to enter into serious negotiations on any of
                                the <pb facs="0512" n="466" xml:id="pg_466"/> major US concerns,
                                lack of cooperation by the Soviet bloc, and the perception by many
                                western countries and allies that their interests are well served by
                                the overall text or something close to it even if the deep seabed
                                mining provisions are deficient. Some US allies, however, worked
                                closely with us (<gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, France,
                                    <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, Belgium and Italy). The
                                effort of a group of eleven countries (including Canada, Australia,
                                New Zealand, the Nordic countries and Switzerland) to develop
                                compromise proposals and encourage genuine negotiations on some of
                                the issues of concern to the US failed.</p>
                            <p>The negotiations at the session did produce a resolution on
                                Preparatory Investment Protection (<gloss target="#t_PIP_1"
                                    >PIP</gloss>), designed to allow pre-existing seabed miners to
                                make a transition to the Treaty regime. Intended originally to give
                                priorities for mine sites and production to the five existing
                                pioneer consortia (two US-led, two with major US participation and
                                one all-French), the resolution widened the field of pioneers beyond
                                those five to include national entities from Japan, India, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, as well as some
                                developing country entrants if they are able to meet certain
                                financial qualifications by January 1, 1985. The pioneer miners
                                would still be subject to the provisions of the Convention that we
                                were unable to change and, in this sense, <gloss target="#t_PIP_1"
                                    >PIP</gloss> does not resolve any of our major problems with the
                                Convention.</p>
                            <p>We were able at the Conference to block any significant adverse
                                changes in the non-seabeds provisions of the Convention that serve
                                US interests. Amendments to restrict the use of straits and require
                                prior notification/authorization for warships to pass through
                                territorial seas were defeated or withdrawn.</p>
                            <p>The following stages remain on the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                    >LOS</gloss> schedule:</p>
                            <p>—Drafting Committee: In July and August the final text will be
                                readied for submission to the Conference.</p>
                            <p>—Informal Plenary: In a brief three-day meeting in September the
                                Drafting Committee changes will be approved and the Final Act will
                                be prepared for signature.</p>
                            <p>—Caracas: In December, the Final Act will be signed by Conference
                                participants authenticating the text of the Convention. At that
                                Session, interpretative statements giving national views of the
                                meaning of textual provisions will be made. The Convention will then
                                be opened for signature.</p>
                            <p>—Preparatory Commission: After 50 countries have signed the
                                Convention, the Preparatory Commission will meet (probably in 1983)
                                to begin preparing the rules, regulations and procedures governing
                                seabed mining as well as to administer <gloss target="#t_PIP_1"
                                    >PIP</gloss> and prepare for the operations of the International
                                Seabed Authority and the Law of the Sea Tribunal.</p>

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects for Signature and Ratification</p>
                            <p>We anticipate that virtually all countries participating in the
                                Conference, including our allies, will sign the Final Act as this is
                                a legal certification of the accuracy of the text.</p>
                            <p>As for the substantive step of signing the Convention itself, we
                                anticipate that the requisite 50 countries to establish the PrepCom
                                will sign it shortly after it is opened for signature. The
                                developing countries will sign early and in large numbers. Among our
                                close friends, France, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand,
                                together with the Nordic countries, are likely to be early
                                signatories. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, Belgium and Italy may wait to
                                sign until they can gauge better the degree of support for the
                                Convention world wide. We expect the Soviet Union and eastern bloc
                                countries to be among the early signatories.</p>
                            <p>With sixty ratifications necessary to bring the Convention into force
                                and with over 120 developing countries, we expect the Convention
                                eventually to enter into force. It is not possible to say how many
                                countries will eventually ratify the Convention. Many nations which
                                sign may await the outcome of the PrepCom to determine the viability
                                of the seabed provisions. A US decision against signature, an effort
                                to establish an alternative seabed regime, the uncertainty regarding
                                rules and regulations to be prepared by the PrepCom, and the
                                burdensome seabed regime may cause some important allied governments
                                to hold off a decision on ratification which may, in turn, deter
                                certain developing countries. Some developing countries may have
                                difficulty ratifying the Convention for their own domestic,
                                political reasons as well.</p>
                            <p>The advantages of the non-seabed provisions, a willingness to “grin
                                and bear” the deep seabed mining regime, a concern not to sour
                                relations with developing countries on this, and domestic pressures
                                are key elements in the ratification calculus of our allies. In the
                                absence of strong US diplomatic pressure, virtually all western
                                countries are likely in time to join. Even with US pressure, many
                                may participate in the Convention. Ultimate ratification by the
                                Soviet Union is not clear if the US and its allies stay out, but it
                                probably would accede if our allies did, thus isolating the US.</p>

                                Conference on the Law of the Sea stemmed primarily from the US

                                interpreted, meets these concerns and is consistent with US
                                interests. A significant element of the package deal was that we
                                would recognize the 12-mile territorial sea (abandoning the 3-mile
                                position) if freedom of navigation and overflight was assured within
                                the some 115 straits worldwide which would then be overlapped by
                                12-mile territorial seas. Under historical rules of innocent passage
                                through a territorial sea, overflight would be subject to the
                                consent of the coastal state and submarines would be required to
                                transit on the surface. Given the critical importance of straits,
                                such restrictions would unacceptably reduce air mobility and
                                subsurface flexibility and nondetectability. To avoid this, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Treaty provides for the
                                freedom of “transit passage” in, under, and over straits, while
                                recognizing residual territorial sea rights in the straits state.
                                Whether such a “package” approach will be followed by straits states
                                and others remains to be seen.</p>
                            <p>Many states have already taken action extending jurisdiction to the
                                12-mile territorial sea, but not with regard to freedom of transit
                                through straits or the right of innocent passage of warships through
                                the territorial sea. Other states have asserted jurisdiction broader
                                than would be authorized by the Convention. Many commentators,
                                including the American Law Institute,<note n="8" xml:id="d162fn8"
                                    >See <ref target="#d160fn7">footnote 7, Document
                                    160</ref>.</note> regard the text in these areas as reflective
                                of customary international law. Recently, the International Court of
                                Justice regarded the 200-mile exclusive economic zone (which we do
                                not presently claim or recognize) as having been established in
                                international law.</p>
                            <p>If the Convention comes into force, even without us, our interests in
                                insuring stability and limiting coastal state claims would be served
                                in this respect. With or without a treaty in force, we will need to
                                exercise our rights firmly as some coastal States will likely assert
                                even more expansive claims. Except in some limited respects relating
                                to the exclusive economic zone, it is unrealistic to expect that we
                                could influence state practice to coalesce around anything other
                                than the principles in the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                                Treaty. Accordingly, we have an interest in insuring that those
                                navigation and overflight principles remain viable.</p>
                            <p>The US should not immediately announce its willingness to abide by
                                all the jurisdictional elements of the text, particularly as they
                                bear on navigation and overflight. Furthermore, as a matter of
                                leverage, we should not formally give up our present position
                                without attaining some benefits, particularly the benefit of seeing
                                state practice develop toward navigation and overflight principles
                                set out in the text. There<pb facs="0515" n="469" xml:id="pg_469"
                                />fore, we should not, as a formal matter, immediately recognize the
                                12-mile territorial sea, the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, the
                                archipelagoes claimed by island States, or other special forms of
                                coastal State jurisdiction bearing on navigation and overflight
                                which we do not already recognize. In the long term, however, our
                                navigation and overflight program should be designed to protect our
                                rights and direct the practice of states toward our interpretation
                                of the navigation and overflight principles of the text. The
                                Department of Defense, in conjunction with State and Transportation,
                                will conduct a review of how our positions and programs should

                            <p>Commercial navigation stands to benefit from the adoption of the
                                Convention even though the US is not a party. However, the regime
                                for commercial navigation will not be as predictable and stable
                                without US participation in the Convention. This may lead to
                                increased interference by coastal states with the movement of
                                vessels, particularly tankers and other vessels carrying hazardous
                                cargoes, primarily for reasons related to marine pollution. Although
                                it is anticipated that such problems will generally have to be
                                handled on a case-by-case, country-by-country basis, concerned
                                departments will review this issue to identify potential problems

                            <p>Establishment of a US-flag seabed mining industry outside the
                                Convention will probably require a viable alternative seabed
                                arrangement. Achieving that may well require, at a minimum, that a
                                few key allies (particularly the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                                and <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) not ratify the <gloss

                                consistent with the US approach. Even with a major US diplomatic
                                effort it is unclear whether the US can achieve that result. If our
                                allies ratify the Convention, and assuming continued US opposition
                                to it, our choice will be whether and how to proceed unilaterally,
                                depending on the costs and benefits at the time.</p>
                            <p>At present, the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention is
                                the only comprehensive, though severely flawed, system purporting to
                                cover all aspects of oceans activity. Seeking an alternative
                                framework could be a lengthy process, requiring a sustained
                                high-level effort to convince as many countries as possible—but most
                                particularly some key allies—that (1) their seabed mining interests
                                would be better served by not ratifying the Convention and by
                                joining a different regime, and (2) their non-seabed mining <pb
                                    facs="0516" n="470" xml:id="pg_470"/> interests, which they
                                consider to be generally well-served by the Convention, will not
                                suffer significantly if they remain outside the Convention.</p>
                            <p>The alternative seabed regime we envision would cover all seabed
                                minerals. It would include provisions on resolution of conflicting
                                mine site claims, and allow each state to exercise control over its
                                nationals without regulation by an international authority,
                                significant revenue sharing, or technology transfer
                                requirements.</p>
                            <p>Pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss> 20, we have sought
                                to negotiate a Reciprocating States Agreement (<gloss
                                    target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss>) with the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                    >UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and France
                                which would be interim to an acceptable <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                    >LOS</gloss> Convention or an alternative regime. Although a
                                bilateral agreement with the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> may
                                be possible, an <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> with the other
                                major potential seabed mining nations is not achievable in the near
                                term and not achievable at all unless these countries stay out of
                                the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention. Although many
                                of our allies also have problems with some of the seabed mining
                                provisions in the Convention, they do not find them as onerous or
                                objectionable as we do. They have insisted that any <gloss
                                    target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> they sign be interim to the
                                Convention with little, if any, semblance to an alternative regime.
                                It might be possible to negotiate a “pre-<gloss target="#t_RSA_1"
                                    >RSA</gloss>” which calls for cooperation on seabed mining
                                issues with the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>. While such an agreement would not
                                permit reciprocal recognition of mine sites, it would represent a
                                sign of unity among the industrial allies.</p>
                            <p>The Commerce Department is under strong domestic pressure from
                                certain elements in Congress and two of the four mining consortia to
                                begin processing applications for seabed mining licenses,
                                unilaterally if necessary. Commerce has repeatedly delayed the date
                                for receiving and processing applications to accommodate our allies
                                in the <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> discussions and has
                                decided to begin processing on June 21. Unilateral processing of
                                mining applications would not preclude subsequent conclusion of an
                                    <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss>, but it will initiate a
                                process which, in time, could make it more difficult to achieve.</p>
                            <p>If, in the end, we find ourselves isolated, we could consider seeking
                                to create conditions for US companies to operate under US licenses,
                                although other countries need not recognize such licenses.
                                Unilateral action would place US miners in danger of having their
                                sites legally and politically challenged by applicants and their
                                sponsors under the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> regime and
                                therefore would make financing more difficult. Moreover, to the
                                extent that opportunities arise for the G–77 countries to retaliate
                                against the mining consortia by denying them contracts in other
                                areas, seabed mining may be more costly. We would argue that our
                                activities were justified under the doctrine of high seas freedoms.
                                It would require that the US seek to resist all challenges—legal and
                                political—to that right, including the likely efforts of the United
                                Nations <pb facs="0517" n="471" xml:id="pg_471"/> and the
                                International Court of Justice to deny that such a right exists
                                under current international law. To encourage the large investments
                                needed for profitable mining, it may also be necessary to provide
                                government-sponsored “risk insurance” against legal and political
                                challenges.</p>
                            <p>It is not clear that we could effectively meet the challenges if we
                                are isolated. Even with risk insurance, some and perhaps all of the
                                US miners may well decide to conduct seabed activities under foreign
                                flag through the Convention, if those entities gain access and find
                                the regime economically viable.</p>

                                the US would have to rely on the Connally Reservation<note n="10"

                                    the International Court of Justice.</note> to the US acceptance
                                of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court and assert that this is
                                a matter “essentially within the jurisdiction of the United States”.
                                Such an assertion would likely be legally and politically
                                controversial since others would argue that the question of the
                                legality of activity on the high seas is a question of international
                                law and is not essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the
                                US. Such an assertion could also result in the Court finding the
                                Connally Reservation invalid either as asserted or in toto. The
                                Court might either proceed to decide the case over our objection or
                                decide that the US had not in fact acceded to the Court’s compulsory
                                jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>Although the US can currently make credible legal arguments in
                                support of its position on the merits of seabed mining outside of

                                entry into force would make the US case more difficult. The likely
                                outcome of any proceeding is placed further in doubt in view of the

                                the Convention contains desirable elements, there were aspects which
                                we do not like and which we only accepted in the negotiating
                                context. At this stage, we do not believe that we need to take a
                                formal position on these provisions of the Convention. Many of our
                                non-seabeds interests are protected by the Convention even though
                                the US does not sign it. To the extent they are not protected, we
                                may be able to protect our interests through bilateral or regional

                            <p>We are likely to find that in some instances, particularly in

                                    >LOS</gloss> Convention. Specifically, we would want to maintain
                                our requirement that foreign nations fishing off our coast provide
                                us with commensurate economic benefits for US fishery interests.
                                Further, we would want to maintain our positions on salmon and tuna
                                to ensure the protection of these resources and our affected
                                industries. We should seek to develop favorable conditions for
                                conduct of US marine scientific research in foreign coastal waters,
                                improving whenever possible on restrictive provisions of the

                                in order to achieve this objective. The interested agencies will

                            <p>The disadvantages of a decision not to sign are that if we are not

                                possibly face an adverse International Court decision; (3) could

                                that countries already expect that the US will not sign; and that

                            <p>There is disagreement, however, on what effect an early decision and

                                develop an alternative regime for deep seabed mining. Those favoring

                            <p>This is a false option.</p>
                            <p>Some other countries (e.g., France, New Zealand and Norway) have
                                hinted that the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention may
                                be amended in a few areas favorable to the US. Some individuals
                                outside government have argued that US efforts now should
                                concentrate on getting such changes. All agencies, however, believe
                                that there is no chance of achieving US objectives, and that
                                encouraging such activity could undercut our <gloss

                                is no chance for improving the Convention in any way and that
                                exploring such “indications” would damage the US ability to achieve
                                alternative arrangements.</p>

                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName> introduced a
                            draft summary. The paper was discussed line by line. A number of
                            clarifications were agreed to, particularly with regard to Issue 5. It
                            was the chairman’s view, supported <pb facs="0522" n="476"

                            eventual usefulness to U.S. objectives. Interior and others expressed
                            reservations that in case such offers yielded only partial results when
                            measured against the President’s six objectives, the U.S. would suffer
                            in meeting its objectives through an alternative seabed arrangement. All
                            participating agencies agreed the U.S. should strengthen high-level

                            <p>Interior, Labor and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> oppose any

                                participation; the Conference process has done little to respond to
                                U.S. concerns in the seabed mining part of the Convention; we should
                                not lend credibility to the process by continued participation; and
                                any participation will be seen by some as a weakening of U.S.

                            <p>Defense, Treasury, Commerce, State and Justice, assuming a prior
                                Presidential statement that the U.S. will not sign the Convention
                                adopted by the Conference, favor continued participation in the
                                process. They believe that participation in the Drafting Committee
                                and the closing session in December is an effective means of (1)
                                ensuring that no “technical” drafting changes, adverse to U.S.
                                navigation and overflight, fisheries, and other non-seabed mining
                                interests are included in the final text; (2) countering adverse
                                interpretive statements that may be made at the closing session; and
                                (3) they believe that the Presidential statement will counteract
                                misinterpretation of U.S. participation. This participation would be
                                at the expert technical level.</p>
                            <p>Transportation and <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> believe we

                                objectives, could be misread by some as a U.S. willingness to sign a
                                slightly altered Convention now or in the future, and could detract
                                from our efforts to get an alternative seabed mining
                                arrangement.</p>
                            <p>Defense recommends that the U.S. take a neutral position, neither
                                encouraging or discouraging such initiatives.</p>
                            <p>Commerce believes the U.S. should, under certain circumstances,
                                encourage efforts to amend the text in a manner that would not
                                compromise U.S. objectives. It may be that there is “no chance of
                                achieving U.S. objectives”, but we should be prepared to exploit the
                                possibility, however slim, that the Convention could be changed to
                                accommodate our interests in fostering the development of deep
                                seabed resources by US-flag consortia. By all current indications,
                                Commerce believes, the U.S. now stands in the worst conceivable
                                position with respect to its previously identified interests in the
                                deep seabeds: the Convention as adopted does not meet our
                                objectives; and a viable alternative regime acceptable to U.S.
                                mining interests appears unachievable.</p>
                            <p>Given the current disinclination of other potential seabed mining

                                as their assertion that U.S. seabed interests can still be met in

                                that we need better knowledge of the facts in order to determine

                            outlined the areas of consensus—on not signing the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> convention and on trying to get some
                            allies to come along with us—and the issues for consideration:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. Should we decide not to sign the convention now or later?</p>
                            <p>2. Should we participate in the remaining conference process?</p>
                            <p>3. Should we encourage improving the convention?</p></quote>
                        <p>He asked State for its assessment of the chances for getting some
                            alternative deep seabed mining arrangement outside the convention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                    >Stoessel</persName></hi> noted that the chances do not look
                            good. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> is waivering; the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> is uncertain but might go along; Japan
                            and France are negative. He said we should make an effort to see if key
                            allies will come along with us, and we should also make a last effort
                            with allies to see if improvement in the convention is possible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName></hi>
                            asked about the views of industry, particularly the deep seabed mining
                            consortia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            noted that some are very interested in and want an alternative to the
                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> convention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            said that we need to take a more aggressive posture, use whatever
                            leverage possible toward an alternative arrangement, and get there first
                            outside the convention. The more aggressive we are, the more others may
                            reconsider their interests in the convention. We should not accept
                            mining under the convention as inevitable but try to shape the
                            future.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1"
                                >Watt</persName></hi> supported that.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName></hi>
                            noted that the first issue concerns whether to make the decision now or
                            later on signing the convention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LALD_1"
                                    >Lewis</persName></hi> said that the convention has some value
                            and provisions of interest to us, and we should be in the rest of the
                            process <pb facs="0528" n="482" xml:id="pg_482"/> rather than have it go
                            ahead without us. He added that we should try to improve the present
                            convention and that a decision against signing now could hinder or
                            impact adversely on that process.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                    >Stoessel</persName></hi> said that we should say soon that we
                            do not plan to sign and certainly before the Drafting Committee in July.
                            This would not preclude a further effort to improve the convention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LALD_1"
                                    >Lewis</persName></hi> said he agreed on timing.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> summarized the consensus that we
                            should make the decision now on not signing the convention but not
                            release a statement until we consult with our allies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName></hi>
                            turned to the issue of whether the US should participate in the
                            remaining conference process.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1"
                                    >Stoessel</persName></hi> said that we should continue to
                            participate but at the expert level.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AKL_1"
                                >Adelman</persName></hi> supported participation in the Drafting

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CAJ_1"
                                    >Carlucci</persName></hi> said we should take part.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1"
                                >Watt</persName></hi> opposed any participation in the process.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DRRJ_1"
                                    >Donovan</persName></hi> also opposed any participation on
                            grounds that it would be unproductive and send a wrong signal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_SRJ_1"
                                    >Smith</persName></hi> supported State on participation, but
                            added that it all relates to where we are on an alternative arrangement:
                            if we are to participate, we should make clear our fundamental position
                            against the deep seabed mining parts of the convention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1"
                                    >Baldrige</persName></hi> said that a statement against signing
                            will avoid any misreading of our intention. The benefit of participation
                            may not be big, but we should be there to protect our interests in
                            non-seabed provisions, including our important interests in not having
                            the convention interpreted or changed in a way that would conflict with
                            our law on fisheries. We have nothing to lose by participation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LALD_1"
                                    >Lewis</persName></hi> concurred with State.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                >Schneider</persName></hi> said that some would see participation as
                            undermining our rejection of the convention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            asked whether participation could be limited to the non-seabed portions
                            of the convention and whether we could make that clear. He said that we
                            will not get improvements in the convention anywhere near meeting the
                            President’s six objectives.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName></hi>
                            said that such participation would be possible and would be essentially
                            in a defensive posture on the non-seabed portions. This would avoid
                            giving any wrong signals.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary Davis</hi> said we should decide now
                            on signing and then participate in the process. Of the areas to protect,
                            oil rights are also important.</p>

                            avoid giving a wrong signal while still being able to monitor the

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName></hi>
                            asked what US seabed miners will do.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1"
                                    >Baldrige</persName></hi> said that most US deep seabed miners
                            will probably go under a foreign flag if the convention comes into force
                            with key countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LALD_1"
                                    >Lewis</persName></hi> supported that view.</p>

                            signals as that was what he was getting.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            supported participating in the process in a defensive mode but not in

                            said we would not be bound by the convention but it may become customary
                            international law.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Darman</hi> agreed that the risk is that the
                            convention will become customary international law in this sense as well
                            and, if so, that would be enforceable in a US court. We have no
                            practical choice of going it alone; we need a treaty or another
                            group.</p>

                            then US citizens are not bound in except in narrow circumstances.</p>

                            go ahead outside the convention if it became customary international

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> summarized the consensus—that we

                            asked at what point we talk about seabed mining with our allies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            said that there would be no participation in the seabed mining area at
                            all and that he believes the regime will fall on its own weight. He

                            disagreed and said that we should not hold out a false hope of
                            improvements or signing if we got them since there is no chance of
                            getting changes meeting the six objectives. We would send mixed signals

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted we should try to persuade our

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName></hi>
                            questioned whether this thinking got us where we are in the first place.
                            He said it will not change one item and any hope for us is not with the
                            convention but in getting our allies to join with us in an alternative
                            arrangement. We need to cut the convention idea off right now. Our

                        <p>1. The US is not against the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Treaty.
                            We are simply but strongly against the sea-bed mining provisions of it,
                            and thus cannot sign.</p>
                        <p>2. We are against <hi rend="italic">these</hi> provisions primarily
                            because they go <hi rend="italic">against economic development</hi>. The
                            Treaty has a bias against production (by production limits and up to 70%
                            tax rate on net receipts). They discourage the creation of new wealth,
                            which we support more than the distribution of existing wealth.</p>
                        <p>3. These provisions <hi rend="italic">dampen creativity and
                                ingenuity.</hi> The mandatory transfer of technology goes against
                            our Constitutional guarantees of patents and protection of scientific
                            discovery. Those who invent and create must instantly share the fruits
                            of their labors with those who do not.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Treaty amendment procedure is
                                <hi rend="italic">blatantly unconstitutional</hi>. The Treaty can be
                            amended in 20 (or 25) years without any further Senate ratification. In
                            essence, we would be signing away Senate perogatives by signing this
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>5. The Treaty manifests the infuriating and unnecessary <hi rend="italic"
                                >politicization of international organizations</hi>. For it provides
                            income to the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> and other so-called liberation
                            movements. The <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, et al. are not experts at
                            deep-sea mining, nor should they reap the benefits thereof.</p>
                        <p>6. The “common heritage of mankind” in this Treaty has the <hi
                                rend="italic">exact opposite meaning</hi> given that phrase by its
                            founder, John Locke. He believes that potential wealth (deer, fish, or

                            individual mixed his labor with that non-owned entity, at which time it
                            became his private property. (See <hi rend="italic">Second Treatise of

                        <p>We just received an urgent phone call from Rodric Braithwaite, Commercial
                            Minister at the British Embassy. The British have heard that the
                            President is expected to announce soon that the U.S. will not sign the
                            Law of the Sea (<gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>) Treaty as adopted
                            in New York in April. He told me in strong language that if, in addition
                            to our many outstanding problems, the U.S. were to do so before <hi
                                rend="italic">real</hi> consultations had been held, “the fat will
                            be in the fire.” When we asked whether the cause for British concern was
                            the expected lack of consultations or the decision itself not to sign,
                            Braithwaite gave an unclear answer, but again emphasized the necessity
                            for consultation, as, he claimed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName> had agreed with the British State Secretary in

                            protect U.S. interests and will not extend to the seabed mining part.

                        <p>2. Consultations were held July 21–22 among US, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and French Reps to
                            review draft agreement concerning interim arrangement relating to
                            polymetallic nodules of the deep seabed.</p>
                        <p>3. Text of agreement, not including schedule and annexes, as developed
                            during these negotiations, is contained in para 12 below. Full draft
                            text will be brought to Washington July 23 by US Del member Mary McLeod.
                            With exceptions noted below, there is virtual agreement on text on
                            schedule and annexes and no controversial issues remain.</p>
                        <pb facs="0537" n="491" xml:id="pg_491"/>
                        <p>4. Except for para 8(1)(C) of Part I (see para 10 below), <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, France and <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> Del were close to ad referendum agreement on text of
                            agreement. <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> could probably agree to
                            text as is or to any reasonable compromise acceptable to others. If
                            solution to para four of agreement is found, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> will probably agree to text essentially along lines
                            contained para 12 below. France has reserved on several articles and may
                            seek further changes, but except for para four of agreement, all French
                            problems seem capable of quick resolution.</p>
                        <p>5. Main problem during negotiations—and only serious outstanding
                            issue—has been French-<gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> insistence on
                            provision that no <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> could enter into
                            force prior to beginning of January 1983. French-<gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> aim has been to prevent US from
                            negotiating <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> with another country
                            (read <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>) which would enter into force
                            prior to December Caracas <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                                meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">The concluding sessions for the
                                treaty were moved from Caracas to Montego Bay, Jamaica.</note>
                            (During course of negotiations, French/<gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> attempted to block us even from concluding <gloss
                                target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> during next few months but gave that
                            effort up in face of strong US and <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            opposition.) In proposed text, France and <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> would agree to accept in a formal public document
                            possibility of negotiating <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> with US
                            between now and January 1, 1982. This, they have argued, keeps door for
                                <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> open and does not close options
                            for any party. French and <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Dels
                            repeatedly expressed concern that US might pressure them to conclude
                                <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> in near term before they have
                            completed their <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> review. This, they
                            allege, could drive them into <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            Treaty. In return for postponing such pressure until 1983, they will
                            agree to consult with us before announcing any decision on <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> as well as accepting publicly
                            possibility of negotiating an <gloss target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> with
                            US.</p>
                        <p>6. US Del expressed strong objection to this approach. US Reps attempted
                            to delete provision, to move up date before which <gloss
                                target="#t_RSA_1">RSA</gloss> could not enter into force (e.g.
                            December 1982) or to make commitment reciprocal by requiring other
                            parties to agree not to take any action on <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> Treaty during same period. All US efforts to delete or
                            amend this provision met very strong opposition from French and <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Reps. US Del agreed to submit text of
                            paragraph four to Washington for review but did not agree to text even
                            on ad referendum basis.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment. In US Del view, if US agrees to provision contained in para
                            four of agreement (see below) or along these lines, it would be possible
                            to conclude agreement quickly. All other outstanding issues can probably
                            be resolved. On other hand, if US insists on deletion or significant
                            change in para four, such as changing January 3 date, it <pb facs="0538"
                                n="492" xml:id="pg_492"/> seems likely that <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and France will refuse to sign. US Del recognizes that
                            such provision would substantially reduce value of agreement. End
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>8. French have so far reserved on para five of the agreement. French may
                            also wish to add provisions requiring parties to implement results of
                            private industry arbitration procedures. US Reps pointed out US
                            difficulties with this approach and French may not insist. French and
                            Germans have insisted on six months denunciation clause (para eleven of
                            agreement). US asked for thirty day clause. We expect that this issue
                            can be resolved if, and when, para four is settled.</p>
                        <p>9. Agreement contains no accession clause. French Rep pressed for
                            limiting parties to US, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and France. <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss>, with US support, urged that potential parties include
                            Italy, Belgium, Japan and Netherlands and, possibly, Canada. We expect
                            France ultimately to agree to this view.</p>
                        <p>10. Para 8(1)(c) of Part I (application procedures) has not been agreed
                            upon. US Del proposed that provision read that each party shall accept
                            amendments to applications to which agreement applies only if amendments
                            are filed between July 23 and October 15, 1982, consistent with US
                            regulations. Other dels argued strongly that October 15 date was too
                            early and later date should be substituted or deleted.</p>

                            their respective laws in respect of deep sea bed operations, the parties
                            concerned shall when necessary apply the procedures and impose the

                        <p>8. The schedule hereto is an integral part of this agreement and Part IV
                            thereof shall apply for the interpretation of this agreement.</p>
                        <p>9. This agreement may be amended by written agreement of all the

                            involvement in trying to get our allies to stay out of the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention. My own strong feeling is
                            that the President should not spend his political capital on this issue
                            at present for three reasons:</p>
                        <p>—There are too many other things on the plate (e.g., sanctions, steel,
                            grain, arms control); neither our <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            interests nor our other interests will be helped by adding further to
                            the existing load.</p>
                        <p>—We have not come up, even in our own minds, with a clear conception of
                            what an “alternate regime” will look like. Ideally it would maintain all
                            of those aspects of the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention
                            which we do not oppose (e.g., navigation and overflight rights, fishing,
                            continental shelf, territorial waters, pollution control, etc.), while
                            writing new rules for deep seabed mining which would suit us. At this
                            point, we have barely addressed the legal and political implications of
                            such an effort, and to drive it with Presidential horsepower now seems
                            premature at best.</p>
                        <p>—It won’t work anyway and it’s not worth the cost. Most of our allies
                            have already said that they do not intend to oppose the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention. Several have voiced
                            serious problems with some parts of it, but on balance believe that
                            being a part of the international regime is preferable to being outside
                            it. Besides disagreeing on substance, they disagree on procedures and
                            feel that we did not consult adequately and showed unnecessary haste in
                            announcing that we would not sign.</p>
                        <p>The action plan also recommends that we send a “special presidential
                            envoy” to meet at high levels with allied governments. His objective
                            would be to urge others to defer a decision on signing the Convention
                            and to keep open the option of joining us in an “alternate regime”
                            later. I think this is a good idea and, depending on how his
                            instructions are written, the emissary could help in the consultation
                            process and <pb facs="0542" n="496" xml:id="pg_496"/> in formulating our
                            future policy steps. I think <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2">Jim
                                Buckley</persName> would be an ideal envoy. He has dealt with <gloss

                            <p>Our longer-term objective is to convince our allies and other nations
                                not to ratify the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty but,
                                instead, to join us in an alternative regime.</p>
                            <p>If we are to achieve our objectives, the President must be involved
                                in this effort. Head of government to head of government contacts
                                are vital to initiate the action plan and may be necessary again as
                                we implement it. A presidential communication to London, Bonn,
                                Paris, Rome, Brussels, The Hague, and Tokyo should be made as soon
                                as possible. This message would underscore the serious problems of
                                the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty and forecast the
                                arrival of an emissary.</p>
                            <p>A presidential envoy would be sent to foreign capitals in early
                                September. He should be of high rank and be prepared to discuss
                                these <pb facs="0544" n="498" xml:id="pg_498"/> matters with foreign
                                officials of ministerial rank. The envoy would: be prepared with

                                level contacts he will make; seek to obtain a political commitment
                                from our allies to defer decisions on signing the <gloss

                                our proposals for an alternative deep seabed mining regime;
                                emphasize that such a regime, if widely accepted by the seabed
                                mining states, would create a viable legal and practical
                                alternative; and sound out their concerns on non-seabeds <gloss
                                    target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> issues to enable us to focus
                                clearly our subsequent contacts. After the emissary’s initial
                                visits, further consultations would include appropriate <gloss
                                    target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> experts.</p>
                            <p>The emissary should initially visit the Federal Republic of Germany,
                                the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Belgium, Italy and the
                                Netherlands. A second tier of countries might, subsequently, be
                                approached by the same or another appropriate emissary.</p>
                            <p>By August 14 the preparatory work for the presidential communication
                                and emissary visits will be completed. This would include:</p>
                            <quote><p>• a draft communication from the President;</p>
                                <p>• instructions for the emissary with talking points; and</p>
                                <p>• background material appropriate for the political nature of the
                                    emissary’s contacts. This paper will include an outline of an
                                    alternative regime and background to enable the emissary to
                                    sound out the concerns of the allies on non-seabed
                                issues.</p></quote>
                            <p>Within this period, suggestions on the emissary will be forwarded to
                                the White House.</p>
                            <p>During the implementation of this action plan we must take advantage
                                of the Secretary of State’s and other cabinet officers’ contacts
                                with their foreign counterparts to press our <gloss

                                >LOS</gloss> negotiations agreed with this assessment. The <gloss

                            to start discussions about an alternative regime with the allies.</p>
                        <p>This approach is considered <hi rend="italic">essential for three

                        <p>1. It will make it <hi rend="italic">unambiguously clear to our allies

                        <p>2. It will <hi rend="italic">elevate the issue to the political level and

                                to the President’s position</hi>. The professionals in allied

                            either support the Treaty or want to remain in the Treaty process. As
                            long as we continue dealing at the agency-to-agency level, our allies
                            will continue to drift toward the Treaty. The head of the British

                            Merit</p>
                        <p>The State Department’s recommendation to avoid high-level activity is
                            based on three arguments: (1) that “too many other things are on the
                            plate”; (2) that we should wait until we have fully developed an
                            alternative; and (3) that “it won’t work and it’s not worth the cost”.
                            None of these arguments have merit.</p>
                        <p>1. The foreign policy plate is always full. This does not mean that we
                            can stop forcefully pursuing important strategic interests. If we treat

                            by State, the President would become isolated from the rest of the world
                            on this issue. This would not be politically good for the President nor
                            strategically good for the nation. It is clear to me from direct
                            observation that the bureaucrats who have been making the “full plate”
                            argument within the State Department would like the U.S. to become
                            isolated so that a future Administration will join the Treaty. We cannot
                            let this happen. Constructing an alternative regime must become a high
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>2. The argument that we should wait until we have every jot-and-tittle of
                            the alternative worked out is totally off-the-mark. The fact is that we
                            already have a good idea what kind of alternative regime we want. There
                            is no need at this stage to fill all the gaps and set it into concrete.
                            Just the opposite. The whole idea is to approach the allies with a
                            flexible position so that they will become engaged in the development
                            process itself. Once we get our allies in on the planning, we’re half
                            way there.</p>
                        <p>3. The assertion that “it won’t work” is nonsense. It will be a
                            challenge, but there is no evidence to support the contention that it
                            would be futile. There is strong opposition to the Treaty in the private
                                <pb facs="0547" n="501" xml:id="pg_501"/> sector in allied
                            countries. Our arguments are good, and there is every reason to believe
                            they will be listened to by the responsible political leaders of allied
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>One of our nation’s greatest statesmen, Elihu Root, once said: “Every
                            business is best managed by its friends; every undertaking is best
                            prosecuted by those who have faith in it.” The fact that the State
                            Department is ready to concede defeat before the fight has been joined
                            clearly demonstrates why the President and a special envoy must be
                            involved in prosecuting this effort.</p>

                            signed an agreement concerning interim arrangements relating to

                            Treaty. In reply to any such comments, posts should stress that
                            agreement is not a “mini-treaty”. Signature of this agreement is not

                            been agreed upon by the US, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, France
                            and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>. Begin text:</p>

                        <p>—It has been recognised both within the Third United Nations Conference
                            on the Law of the Sea and outside it that the elimination of overlapping
                            of the areas where pioneer explorers conduct deep sea operations is a
                            necessary prerequisite for further exploration for polymetallic nodules.
                            The likelihood of such overlapping in areas of the deep seabed where
                            explorers have been, and wish to continue, prospecting and exploring is
                            a real one. France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom
                            and the United States of America have (like some other countries)
                            enacted interim laws in order to ensure that, pending the adoption of
                            generally agreed arrangements, such operations are conducted in an
                            orderly and peaceful manner. The resolution of overlapping is a
                            necessary corollary of these laws. The main purpose of the agreement,
                            which has just been signed, is to encourage explorers, who have applied
                            to the parties under these laws, to resolve such overlapping by
                            voluntary procedures. It also makes provision for exchanges of
                            information on the procedures for examining such applications. The
                            parties also agree to have further consultations on these matters. These
                            limited arrangements are so framed as not to prejudice the position of
                            any of the parties in relation to the convention. They do not prejudice
                            the decision that France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United
                            Kingdom have yet to take with respect to participation in the Convention
                            on the Law of the Sea—and they are compatible with the documents adopted
                            by the Conference. End text.</p>

                        <p>A Cabinet Council working group met this week and wants to move fast on
                            some substantive issues. I support moving fast on these issues, but the
                            Cabinet Council is still the wrong forum for that. First, the issues
                            which it is addressing are not only international and <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>-related but also tie into other <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> and ocean policy matters that are
                            being considered by State, Defense and the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"

                            among these issues and that is best done with one focal point, not two.
                            Second, State is in fact the only agency qualified to do the papers and
                            backup support for those issues which the Cabinet Council is
                            considering, and this argues as well for its having lead agency

                            system, perhaps reinforced by reiterating your May directive for a
                            review of oceans issues.<note n="5" xml:id="d174fn5">See attachment,
                                    <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> If combined with
                            a decision on the emissary and if <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2"
                                >Buckley</persName> assumed a clearer role, this could energize the

                            a new <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> (perhaps in conjunction with naming
                            an emissary). Spreading these issues among two different systems is, in
                            my view, the worst alternative.</p>

                            policy under the Cabinet Council on Natural Resources and Environment.
                            In effect, we need to:</p>
                        <p>• ensure that <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> understands
                            the high level interest in these issues and their important domestic
                            political aspects;</p>
                        <p>• energize State in this area to fill the vacuum that has been left by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName>’s failure to take
                            charge of these issues; and</p>
                        <p>• reflect this by establishing a new Oceans Policy <gloss

                            by having <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName> chair it and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName> chair the Working

                            matters, except purely domestic issues of development, regulation and

                                xml:id="pg_505"/> territorial waters and continental shelf. In view
                            of some of the failings of the past interagency process under State, and
                            consistent with actions in other areas, I would suggest that we take on
                            the executive secretary function.</p>
                        <p>To the above ends, talking points for a conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> are at Tab A and points for
                            discussing this with <persName corresp="#p_MEE_1">Meese</persName> are
                            at Tab B. We should get this worked out with <persName

                        <p>If this proves acceptable, I will prepare a decision memo for the
                            President’s signature promptly. It would preferably include the decision
                            on having a high level outside emissary and who that emissary will be.
                            Your points for <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> include

                            <p>• As you know, we are still working on getting a high level outside
                                emissary on Law of the Sea for talks in October with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName>, Mitterrand, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJR_2">Schmidt</persName> or his successor,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SZ_1">Suzuki</persName> and possibly a few
                                others.</p>
                            <p>• We are trying to get <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Don
                                    Rumsfeld</persName> lined up.</p>
                            <p>• I know you recommended <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2"
                                    >Buckley</persName> for the mission and reduced Presidential
                                involvement.</p>
                            <p>• But the fact is that these issues have major domestic political as
                                well as international and foreign policy aspects, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >and</hi> the President wants a special emissary and wants to be
                                involved. An emissary would, for example, carry a personal and
                                substantive letter from the President.</p>
                            <p>• Now we face a situation where <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1">Jim
                                    Watt</persName> has written his Cabinet Council to take over a
                                large number of oceans policy issues that are basically
                                international and <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>-related. This
                                could include some new and positive initiatives.</p>
                            <pb facs="0552" n="506" xml:id="pg_506"/>
                            <p>• I directed the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> to review our ocean interests
                                in May<note n="5" xml:id="d175fn5">See <ref target="#d158">Document
                                        158</ref>.</note> and how to protect them but, to be honest,
                                State has not run with that ball. In fact, after working on the
                                emissary State has been largely inactive on these aspects and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> has not taken
                                charge of them ever since his nomination fell through. This created
                                a vacuum for <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1">Watt</persName> to move in
                                with his longstanding interest.</p>
                            <p>• To protect and ensure the best coordination for oceans policy
                                matters, and put State back as lead agency where it belongs, we need
                                a facelifting of the system to reflect high level interest and
                                energize the system.</p>
                            <p>• To this end, I suggest we try to establish a new Oceans Policy
                                    <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> that would consider all
                                oceans and <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>-related matters
                                except purely domestic issues and be chaired by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DKW_1">Ken Dam</persName>. Given <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName>’s current situation and
                                past performance, <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName>
                                should probably chair the Working Group.</p>
                            <p>• To try to correct some of the past problems in the process, I would
                                also suggest that we act as executive secretary to the group.
                                    (<persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Mike Guhin</persName> of my staff
                                follows this matter closely.)</p>
                            <p>• To be effective here I need your help on this, to give these
                                matters higher level and priority attention and to energize the
                                system.</p>
                            <p>• If you have no problems with that approach, I will proceed here on
                                this at the same time as working out the emissary matter.</p>

                            <p>• We need to move ahead on these issues, but the Cabinet Council is
                                not the right forum.</p>
                            <p>• The issues are basically international and <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                    >LOS</gloss>-related, with the few exceptions of development and

                            <p>• The issues have to be coordinated carefully with others in the
                                navigation, overflight and other areas that are being dealt with in
                                State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                                channels.</p>
                            <p>• We need one system and focal point, not two. Moreover, State is
                                recognized as the only agency capable of preparing the backup and
                                analysis for those issues that <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1"
                                    >Watt</persName> is addressing, and this argues for its having
                                lead agency role.</p>
                            <p>• At the same time, I recognize that State did not run with the ball
                                after my May directive that oceans policy issues be reviewed, except
                                for its work on the emissary aspects (which, by the way, has been
                                proceeding). In effect, <persName corresp="#p_MJL_1"
                                    >Malone</persName> has not taken charge of these issues, and
                                probably cannot do so given his current situation, and there has
                                been a vacuum created by State into which <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WJG_1">Watt</persName> has moved.</p>
                            <p>• We are asking for more problems if we allow these issues to be
                                disjoined and split up.</p>
                            <p>• Therefore, to give these matters even higher level focus and to
                                energize the system, we should establish a new Oceans Policy <gloss
                                    target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> with responsibility for all ocean
                                policy matters except those truly domestic issues within our
                                territorial seas and continental shelf and chaired by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DKW_1">Ken Dam</persName>. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName> could chair the Working
                                Group rather than the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> level,
                                and we would plan to be the executive secretary to avoid some of the
                                past problems in the process.</p>
                            <p>• I have talked with <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                                and he now understands the importance of these issues and the
                                President’s personal interest and sees the need to put more steam
                                behind these.</p>
                            <p>• We can expect some complaints from <persName corresp="#p_WJG_1"
                                    >Watt</persName>, but he will clearly understand the logic of
                                what we are doing and his people are still claiming they do not care
                                who does the work.</p>
                            <p>• We need to get this moving now and could establish it at the same
                                time that we get a high level outside emissary for <gloss
                                    target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>. Combined, these could get the
                                ball rolling very effectively and produce some new initiatives
                                fairly quickly.</p>

                            discuss the Law of the Sea Convention.</p>
                        <p>Don’s immediate and primary objective will be to persuade our Allies not
                            to make a decision to sign the Law of the Sea Convention until we have
                            an opportunity to develop and discuss with them an alternative regime.
                            His trip will be an occasion for opening a dialogue <pb facs="0556"
                                n="510" xml:id="pg_510"/> with them on the need for an alternative
                            regime; he will present outlines of possible alternatives; and he will
                            lay the groundwork for convincing our Allies that their navigation and
                            other non-seabeds interests can be protected outside the <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention.</p>
                        <p>This is a major undertaking, one of the highest importance—and of great
                            difficulty, given the drift of our Allies toward signature of the <gloss

                            will be made easier if he is able to talk about other subjects—this will
                            increase the receptivity of his interlocutors to his message on Law of
                            the Sea. Furthermore, Don’s trip gives us a positive opportunity we
                            should not lose to add some emphasis to policy views we have already
                            expressed. Don is, after all, well known from his days at <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            Ministerial</hi>. This is one of the key opportunities for the free
                            world collectively to do something <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> in
                            the next few months. The Japanese seem prepared to cooperate in
                            constructing a new work program; the Europeans tend to be defeatist,
                            thinking it is impossible at this juncture to make progress on trade
                            liberalization. Don could reinforce the efforts <persName

                            partners that the economic difficulties we are all experiencing make it
                            more, not less, important to have a positive result at the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> Ministerial, and to get going
                            thereafter on a program aiming at freer and fairer trade not only in
                            goods, but in services and investment.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> Borrowing
                                Facility</hi>. This is another positive initiative. All countries
                            are concerned about the increasing strains in the international
                            financial system brought about by excessive past borrowing and the
                            increasing pressure which debt service is imposing on several large
                            debtors. The United States has floated a proposal in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> for a special borrowing arrangement
                            which could mobilize a pool of usable currencies more quickly and at
                            less total cost than would be involved in an unjustifiably large <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> quota increase. Stressing your
                            determination to move this proposal to rapid fruition as a means of
                            reestablishing confidence in our ability to meet this problem
                            constructively would add a useful financial dimension to Don’s
                            presentation and help show that we are moving to address each of their
                            major concerns.</p>
                        <pb facs="0557" n="511" xml:id="pg_511"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Non-Proliferation</hi>. I have expressed, in a letter
                            sent to Foreign Ministers,<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">Not found.</note>
                            our strong belief that suppliers should not engage in any significant
                            new nuclear cooperation with non-nuclear weapon states that do not agree
                            to accept full scope safeguards, particularly where there is evidence
                            that a non-nuclear-weapon-state is seeking to develop nuclear
                            explosives. We are acting on this principle by not permitting US
                            companies to assist the Chasma<note n="5" xml:id="d177fn5">The Chashma

                            accepts IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear activities. Don could
                            reinforce our hope that our Allies will join us in requiring full scope
                            safeguards before selling anything to Pakistan for the Chasma
                            project.</p>

                            some additional friendly persuasion to devote more of their resources to
                            defense, and Don, with his background at the Pentagon and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, has the credentials to talk
                            authoritatively on this point. His prime targets should be Paris (the
                            French for the first time in years are cutting back their defense
                            spending); Bonn (where the new government may be more responsive than
                            the old); and Tokyo (where the government could use some bolstering to
                            continue at least at the pace of last year’s progress).<note n="6"

                        <p>None of these are subjects on which we expect Don to “negotiate.” These
                            are, rather, issues where he can help simply by showing that the
                            Administration’s, and especially your interest is deep on these issues.
                            I do not see his discussion of these matters as constituting a major
                            part of his mission—Law of the Sea is and must be the primary subject.
                            But I think adding these subjects will add credibility to Don’s position
                            as your personal representative, and increase the chances of his success
                            in his primary mission.</p>

                            as expected, raised by our allies. Adding subjects to his mandate or
                            broadening the mission’s agenda, however, would be another matter and
                            raises serious questions. That could just as well dilute our <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> message and give our allies an opening
                            to dilute it more by focusing on other items. A broadened agenda could
                            also be perceived as a US gesture or “concession” of a kind that we have
                            sought to avoid in the context of East-West and other economic issues.
                            Finally, some of the issues raised by <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1"
                                >Shultz</persName> are troublesome with our allies and it is not
                            clear how they or our <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> message would
                            really benefit by <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>’s
                            raising them.</p>
                        <p>In light of the above, the proposed memorandum from you to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> at Tab A would inform him that
                            we should not broaden the mission’s agenda but stick with it as

                            concern. Given the importance of the other issues raised by <persName

                            <p>The Law of the Sea message is, as you note, a major undertaking of
                                the highest importance and considerable difficulty. In that light, I
                                have concluded that the mandate and agenda for the mission should
                                not be broadened to include other specific issues but should
                                continue to focus on the specific issue of Law of the Sea, raised in
                                the broad context of furthering common understanding of issues of
                                mutual concern with our allies. <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1"

                            <p>Limiting this mission does not and should not detract from the

                        <p>285983. For the Ambassador. Subj: Special Presidential Emissary.</p>
                        <p>1. Confidential—Entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. The President decided on September 30 to send a special Presidential
                            Emissary to key allied capitals and designated <persName
                                corresp="#p_RDH_1">Donald Rumsfeld</persName> as the emissary.<note

                                176</ref>.</note> Specific purpose of mission is to underline United
                            States concern about the Law of the Sea Treaty and to try to move our
                            allies away from early commitments to sign or ratify that treaty (or in
                            France’s case to try to keep it from acting early on its stated
                            intention to sign the treaty), in the context of our interest in
                            furthering common understanding of issues of mutual concern in allied
                            relationships. In each capital we propose that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> meet with head of government,
                            preferably one-on-one initially, and then with appropriate key ministers
                            that have <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> concerns (e.g., Foreign,
                            Defense, Economic). We expect to follow up on a separate occasion with
                            experts discussions.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassadors should deliver following message from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> to heads of government.
                            Greetings and signature for each capital in para 4 below. Modification
                            to letter for Paris, proposed dates for visits and other info provided
                            in paras 5–12 below. You will note that the letter invites discussion on
                            subjects other than the law of the sea. You should advise orally at
                            appropriate level that—questions relating to East-West trade and
                            economic relationships were discussed by Foreign Ministers in New York
                            and <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> would have nothing
                            to add. Begin qte:</p>
                        <p>—The Law of the Sea Treaty adopted by the United Nations conference last
                            April raises many fundamental concerns for the United States. In July,
                            as you know, I concluded that signing that treaty will not serve the
                            national interest.<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">See <ref target="#d168"
                                    >Document 168</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>—I recognize that the treaty deals with a wide variety of areas and
                            issues. Indeed, my July statement noted that most provisions of the
                            treaty are consistent with the interests of the United States and other
                            countries. Based on a review of significant interests, such as those
                            with <pb facs="0561" n="515" xml:id="pg_515"/> respect to military and
                            commercial navigation, I am confident that they can be fully protected
                            without signing or ratifying the treaty.</p>
                        <p>—At the same time, I also believe that the deep seabed mining provisions
                            of the treaty would be detrimental to the interests of a number of
                            countries, including the United States and our close friends and allies.
                            Development of deep seabed resources on an economic basis would be very
                            difficult, if not impossible, to achieve under the treaty. In broader
                            terms, the treaty would create precedents that are contrary to a range
                            of important interests and that would adversely affect the positions of
                            advanced countries in the future development of international
                            institution-building generally.</p>
                        <p>—These problems are of deep concern to the United States and to me
                            personally. I believe it is very important that we work together to have
                            a clear understanding of the consequences of the Law of the Sea Treaty
                            and to coordinate our efforts in a way that will serve our common
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, let me say that while law of the sea is the issue which has led
                            me to propose Don’s mission, I view it within the context of our broader
                            relationship as allies faced with a number of problems. While each of
                            them has its complexities, I believe deeply that we are capable now, as
                            perhaps never before, of solving them and of demonstrating a degree of
                            allied cohesion unparalleled in the past generation. For this reason,
                            Don will be receptive to listening to other elements of our common
                            agenda. Needless to say, I will value your thoughts greatly and very
                            much look forward to receiving Don’s report.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards,</p>
                        <p>End quote.</p>
                        <p>4. Appropriate greetings and signature of letter for each capital are as

                        <p>5. For Paris: The following revised paragraph should be substituted for
                            paragraph beginning “These problems are— . . .”: Begin quote These
                            problems are of deep concern to the United States and to me personally.
                            I understand that your government recently announced its intention to
                            sign the Law of the Sea Treaty.<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">In telegram

                                <pb facs="0562" n="516" xml:id="pg_516"/> will serve our common

                        <p>6. For all addresses except Paris: Ambassadors should urge host
                            government not to make any commitments to sign or ratify the Law of the
                            Sea Treaty pending emissary’s visit.</p>

                        <p>The second half of the meeting was on Law of the Sea (<gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>). Following presentation of your
                            strong concerns and the problems in the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> Treaty, <persName corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName>
                            said the list was impressive, and he would personally consider it
                            carefully. He welcomed your desire to elevate this issue to the highest
                            level and stressed his desire to stay in contact on it before the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> decision in late November.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName> will be faced with different
                            recommendations from key ministers. Foreign Minister Genscher favors the
                            treaty; Economics Minister Lambsdorff and possibly the new Defense
                            Minister Woerner will probably oppose signing it soon. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName> indicated that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> need not be in any hurry to sign the
                            treaty. (Both Genscher and Lambsdorff recalled that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> had long questioned the treaty, but
                            the US always pushed for it in the past administrations.)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName></hi>
                            also welcomed your elevating the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>
                            issues and was receptive to your concerns. She expressed serious concern
                            about the seabed part—including her distaste for its supranational
                            authority for seabed development, the damaging precedents in and
                            “unworkability” of that machinery, and those principles of the New
                            International Economic Order enshrined in the treaty.</p>
                        <pb facs="0564" n="518" xml:id="pg_518"/>
                        <p>She indicated, however, that some of her ministers may support the treaty
                            on grounds that the advantages of other provisions, particularly those
                            on navigation, outweigh the disadvantages of the seabed mining part. She
                            was inclined to accept our argument that we already have the navigation
                            rights as a matter of international law and practice.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the meeting, her respect, warmth and support for you were
                            abundantly evident. She also had high praise for the way <persName
                                corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName> has started off.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mitterrand</hi> has apparently given little attention
                            to <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> even though his government has
                            announced France will sign the treaty. He listened but did not offer
                            much. He said he will review the matter in light of your concerns, but
                            the French Government seems to have no major problems with the treaty.
                            That is not surprising given their political perspectives and approach
                            to developing countries and North/South issues.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> offer some hope, but the decisions will not be easy for
                                <persName corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName> or <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName>. Besides the splits among
                            their ministers, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> is concerned
                            at the ministerial level that the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            will sign the treaty and leave the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                            little choice. It does not want to be outside with only the US. There
                            may also be a tendency at ministerial and sub-Cabinet levels to see
                            little or no cost in signing the treaty but deferring decision on
                            ratification. We sought to disabuse them of that notion by underlining
                            the costs and the misleading signals of signing.</p>
                        <p>To have any chance of persuading some key friends not to sign, the US
                            needs to:</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> and others meet with
                            heads of government and key ministers—particularly the Spadolini and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName> visits, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> ministerial and the US-<gloss

                            Spadolini because of the unexpected vote of confidence he faced on the

                            is not included in talking points for all such meetings, they will see
                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> as a low priority for you, and
                            there will be no chance of stopping the trend toward signing the

                            In their view, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> had
                            operated with great effectiveness owing to his personal acquaintance
                            with the leaders he saw, his political approach, and his forceful
                            presentation. A second <pb facs="0567" n="521" xml:id="pg_521"/> round
                            of the mission was now underway. Since his visit to Japan depended on
                            the formation of a new Japanese government, its scheduling was not yet

                                November consultations regarding a reciprocal seabed mining
                                agreement. (Reagan Library, Guhin, Michael A.: Files, <gloss

                            inconclusive owing to reluctance by the Europeans to make commitments in
                            advance of national decisions on signing the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> convention. Further talks and coaxing would be
                            required. On the question of new future entrants to a reciprocal regime,
                            U.S. and European views diverged; but the constraints inherent in U.S.
                            law defined our position in favor of an open arrangement.</p>

                        <p>The Chairman raised the matter of Senator Kasten’s objections to U.S.
                            funding of the PrepComm. In the ensuing discussion it was noted that the
                            U.S. share of the budget could reach $5 million unless the U.S. withheld
                            its contribution. The State Department is reviewing the legal and
                            procedural options available to the U.S. delegation to the U.N. on this

                        <p>Our preferred option is to amend the resolution to require voluntary

                            for the <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss>. They are bringing
                            pressure on Jamaica to delete language from the draft resolution
                            providing for additional <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> services for
                            the <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> and for a separate
                            Secretariat in Jamaica. They want to limit costs by using existing

                            <pb facs="0569" n="523" xml:id="pg_523"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> staff estimates that Jamaica’s
                            ambitious plans for the <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss>
                            could cost $20 million, whereas if the resolution is revised to give the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretariat more discretion over
                            funding, <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> costs could be as
                            little as $1 million. In any case, costs of the <gloss
                                target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> will be significant.</p>
                        <p>A second, fall-back option, proposed by the Netherlands, is to seek an
                            amendment to the draft resolution that would authorize payment of <gloss
                                target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> costs from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> budget, but as a loan to the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Authority to be repaid when it is
                            established. This device would support the principle which we are
                            asserting that it is wrong to expect the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> to fund other treaty organizations. There is precedent
                            for this.</p>
                        <p>There is a real possibility that efforts to amend the resolution to
                            either require voluntary funding or a repayable loan by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1"
                                >Prepcom</gloss> costs will fail and that some kind of resolution
                            will pass by which the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> budget will
                            incur the costs of the <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In this event, our past practice concerning resolutions with financial
                            implications that are adopted against our wishes would be to vote
                            against the resolution, express our strong objections, and continue to
                            work to limit expenditures for the <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1"
                                >Prepcom</gloss>, but take no further action.</p>
                        <p>In this unique situation we might want to consider departing from past
                            practice. We could express our opposition more emphatically to this
                            inappropriate use of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> funds by
                            withholding from our contribution to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> budget an amount proportionate to our share of the
                                <gloss target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> costs. This would
                            underscore the seriousness of our opposition to the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty and to the inappropriate use of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> funds for the <gloss
                                target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss>. (We are at a critical point
                            now in attempting to persuade the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and other allies not to sign
                            the treaty.)</p>
                        <p>Such withholding would have no tangible effect on <gloss
                                target="#t_Prepcom_1">Prepcom</gloss> funding, since nations cannot
                            earmark portions of their contributions. More importantly, withholding
                            raises serious legal questions under Article 17 of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter which provides that “the
                            expenses of the organization shall be borne by members as apportioned by
                            the General Assembly.” With the exception noted below, such a
                            withholding would be a departure from our past practice of paying our
                            share, even though the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> budget
                            finances various activities we vote against, and insisting that other
                            nations also do so. Our withholding would also undermine our traditional
                            position against Soviet withholding from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> peacekeeping budget (a position which the Soviets ignore
                                however).<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">Beginning in 1956, the Soviet
                                Union began to withhold money for peacekeeping operations financed
                                by the United Nations.</note>
                            <pb facs="0570" n="524" xml:id="pg_524"/> We would also have to consider
                            U.S. domestic law, including the Anti-Impoundment Act, in weighing the
                            option of withholding.<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">The Congressional
                                Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 sets rules regarding
                                executive branch requests for the rescinding of funds approved by
                                Congress.</note></p>
                        <p>Pursuant to legislation initiated and passed by the Congress, the U.S.
                            has made one exception to the principle of collective responsibility and
                            the practice of full payment of our share, despite an <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> opinion that states members are
                            obligated to pay their assessments.<note n="6" xml:id="d183fn6">The

                            Under this legislation, we withhold small portions of our assessed share
                            equal to a pro-rata share of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> budget
                            support for the Committee on the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian

                        <p>We need not make a decision on the withholding option unless efforts to
                            amend the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> resolution fail.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1">Kirkpatrick</persName> does not
                            believe it would be desirable or effective to threaten explicitly
                            withholding as a means of negotiating language in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> resolution that would meet our
                            objections, although she believes we should put others on notice that
                            such funding by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> of non <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> activities causes us very serious
                            problems and could force us to consider withholding in response. She
                            also believes that further and careful legal analysis of this issue is
                            needed, and that if we decide to pursue this option we should consult
                            with the Congress before proceeding. In the meantime, we are exploring
                            withholding in detail with our lawyers and <gloss target="#t_USUN_1"
                                >USUN</gloss> so that we can reach a prompt decision, if necessary,
                            in the event our efforts to amend the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> resolution fail. General Assembly consideration of the

                        <p>2. At a social event last night attended by Embassy’s <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Officer, subject of <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> was raised in discussion with Michael
                            Wood, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> Embassy’s Legal Adviser, and
                            Dr. Fleischhauer, head of the legal section at the Foreign Office.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WBS_1">Wood</persName> stated at one point
                            that, based on his information, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            would almost certainly not repeat not sign <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> treaty at Jamaica next month.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d184fn2">In telegram 25269 from London, November 19, the
                                Embassy reported that <persName corresp="#p_TM_1"
                                    >Thatcher</persName> stated the British would not sign the
                                treaty. (Ibid.)</note> In response, Fleischhauer remarked that,
                            while there was still no official position, this was also the case with
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, i.e., that it was now
                            “virtually certain” that the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> would
                            not repeat not sign <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty at
                            Jamaica next month (Fleischhauer left open the possibility that it
                            might, of course, sign at some point further in the future). As later
                            discussion confirmed, those who heard Fleischhauer’s remark were taken
                            aback by his candor. (Comment: Fleischhauer’s statement goes well beyond
                            any information Foreign Office has thus far provided to Embassy’s <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> officer on the state of play in <gloss

                            comment.) <persName corresp="#p_WBS_1">Wood</persName> later indicated,
                            but without elaboration, that he thought the solidification in <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>’s thinking had taken place only within
                            the last day or two.</p>
                        <p>3. Embassy cannot, of course, confirm the validity of statements made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_WBS_1">Wood</persName> and Fleischhauer.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WBS_1">Wood</persName>, however, has been
                            involved in <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> matters on the <gloss

                            issue. Fleischhauer, who is extraordinarily well-respected as legal
                            counsel at the Foreign Office and who has just been named the new legal

                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> matters at a relatively high

                                <salute>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</salute>
                            </opener>
                            <p>The Law of the Sea treaty adopted by the United Nations Conference
                                last April raises many fundamental concerns for the United States.
                                In July, as you know, I concluded that signing that treaty will not
                                serve the national interest.</p>
                            <p>I recognize that the treaty deals with a wide variety of areas and
                                issues. Indeed, my July statement noted that most provisions of the
                                treaty are consistent with the interests of the United States and
                                other <pb facs="0573" n="527" xml:id="pg_527"/> countries.<note
                                    n="5" xml:id="d185fn5">See <ref target="#d168">Document
                                        168</ref>.</note> Based on a review of significant
                                interests, such as those with respect to military and commercial
                                navigation, I am confident that they can be fully protected without
                                signing or ratifying the treaty.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, I also believe that the deep seabed mining
                                provisions of the treaty would be detrimental to the interests of a
                                number of countries, including the United States and our close
                                friends and allies. Development of deep seabed resources on an
                                economic basis would be very difficult, if not impossible, to
                                achieve under the treaty. In broader terms, the treaty would create
                                precedents that are contrary to a range of important interests and
                                that would adversely affect the positions of advanced countries in
                                the future development of international institution-building
                                generally.</p>
                            <p>These problems are of deep concern to the United States and to me
                                personally. I believe it is very important that we work together to
                                have a clear understanding of the consequences of the Law of the Sea
                                treaty and to coordinate our efforts in a way that will serve our
                                common interests.</p>
                            <p>For this reason, I have asked <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Don
                                    Rumsfeld</persName> to serve as a special emissary to discuss
                                these matters with you and with other key allies. He has my fullest
                                confidence and I trust that you will consider him to be my personal
                                emissary in regard to the matters I have asked him to raise with
                                    you.<note n="6" xml:id="d185fn6">This paragraph is not in the
                                    text of the letters sent October 10. See <ref target="#d179"
                                        >Document 179</ref>.</note></p>
                            <p>Finally, let me say that while Law of the Sea is the issue which has
                                led me to propose Don’s mission, I view it within the context of our
                                broader relationship as allies faced with a number of problems.
                                While each of them has its complexities, I believe deeply that we
                                are capable now, as perhaps never before, of solving them and of
                                demonstrating a degree of allied cohesion unparalleled in the past
                                generation. For this reason, Don will be receptive to listening to
                                other elements of our common agenda. Needless to say, I will value
                                your thoughts greatly and very much look forward to receiving Don’s
                                report.</p>

                            meetings.</p>
                        <p>3. In all three meetings the Dutch stressed similar themes:</p>
                        <p>(A) Visit was timely as subject of signing the Law of the Sea Treaty will
                            come up for decision soon in Council of Ministers. <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> will give due consideration to US
                            [garble].</p>
                        <p>(B) <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> shares concerns about a few
                            provisions in the seabed part of the treaty—such as mandatory technology
                            transfer and production limits—but years of work and compromises had
                            been accomplished with previous US support and <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> believes a comprehensive treaty is necessary. Many
                            parts of the treaty provide an important degree of legal certainty, and
                            the way to influence the process was to be involved in it and a voting
                            member of Preparatory Commission.</p>
                        <p>(C) <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> considers relations with Third
                            World important.</p>
                        <p>(D) Dutch Shell supports signing the treaty and would be reluctant to
                            invest in seabed mining outside it.</p>
                        <p>(E) A seabed mining alternative outside treaty is not viable. To defer or
                            delay signature, therefore, Dutch would need tangible goals to reach in
                            terms of changing treaty or developing rules and regulations to lessen
                            impact of adverse provisions.</p>
                        <p>4. Lubbers noted that Netherlands saw no reason to hold out with US
                            focusing on alternative rather than getting acceptable treaty. Lubbers
                            provided non-paper with <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> points
                            (para 5 below).</p>
                        <p>5. Begin non-paper:</p>
                        <p>—The Netherlands always held the view that a generally accepted set of
                            rules for the many uses of the sea is of utmost importance both for <pb
                                facs="0575" n="529" xml:id="pg_529"/> the international community
                            and for the Netherlands. In comparison to the 1958 treaties,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d186fn2">Reference is to the Conventions on the Continental
                                Shelf, High Seas, Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, and Fishing
                                and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas.</note> the
                            new treaty is clearer as regards the rule for shipping, fisheries,
                            environmental aspects, scientific sea research and the continental
                            shelf.</p>
                        <p>—The treaty also is the result of a development over several decades;
                            these developments (treaties and case law) are incorporated in the new
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>—The Netherlands for instance anticipated the treaty as regards the 200
                            miles fishing zone and the extension of the territorial waters to 12 sea
                            miles. We also concluded a treaty with Venezuela in this respect.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">Reference is to the Netherlands-Venezuela
                                Boundary Treaty signed in 1978.</note></p>
                        <p>—Of course not all separate parts of the treaty can be judged as
                            favourable. The treaty is a compromise. The environmental and shipping
                            sections are more acceptable to us than the section on economic zones,
                            the continental shelf and the sea research.</p>
                        <p>—From the military point of view the relevant sections of the treaty are
                            considered favourable in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>—The different parts of the treaty are interconnected in this respect.
                            Moreover, new rules are included in the treaty; we do not feel the
                            treaty is no [<hi rend="italic">not</hi>?] more than codification of
                            generally accepted rules; quite apart from the rules on deep sea
                            mining.</p>
                        <p>—Royal Dutch Shell studied the treaty carefully and officially took the
                            view that a speedy conclusion of the treaty is in that company’s
                            interest and asked the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the
                            Netherlands to sign the treaty.</p>
                        <p>—Signing the treaty is a positive contribution to the North-South
                            relationship, in particular in view of our policies vis-a-vis the Third
                            World.</p>
                        <p>—The Netherlands feels it can fully participate in the further work on
                            the Law of the Sea in the context of the new treaty.</p>
                        <p>—We hope that the US Government would share our view that there is no
                            real alternative to this treaty. End non-paper.</p>
                        <p>6. During a later meeting in Strasbourg, <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> President Gaston Thorn expressed appreciation of reasons
                            to oppose seabed parts of treaty. The problem at hand is to stop
                            momentum for all European states to sign <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss>, which has been generated by 4 of the 10 <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> countries having announced intention to
                            sign (France, Ireland, Greece, Denmark). Momentum can only be stopped by
                            a major <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> member—<gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss>—not signing in December and better still, announcing soon
                            that it will not sign.</p>
                        <pb facs="0576" n="530" xml:id="pg_530"/>
                        <p>7. Thorn met with <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–10 Foreign Ministers
                            on Monday, November 22, and planned to discuss <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> over lunch (absent the Foreign Ministers experts being
                            present).</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Commissioner (with responsibility
                            for <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>) Narjes also expressed
                            appreciation for concerns about seabed part of treaty, summarized main
                            country positions on the treaty (which conform to our own estimates) and
                            saw problem in much the same terms as Thorn.</p>

                                    target="#d185">Document 185</ref>.</note> and noted that:</p>
                        <p>—The difficult issues in U.S.–Japan relations can be solved through
                            talks. Quarrels are an indication of the closeness of the U.S.–Japan
                            relationship, like brothers.</p>
                        <p>—He is committed to further strengthening the relationship, both
                            personally and officially.</p>
                        <pb facs="0577" n="531" xml:id="pg_531"/>
                        <p>—U.S.-Japan tie is key to stability in Asia and world stability
                            generally. If there are shaky aspects in the relationship, policy toward
                            the Soviet Union and China cannot be effectively conducted and ASEAN
                            countries worry as well.</p>
                        <p>—Discussions at highest level are important.</p>
                        <p>4. Following <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>’s
                            presentation of U.S. concerns about the Law of the Sea Treaty and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s hopes that
                            Japan will decide not to sign it or at least to delay any signing,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> noted that:</p>
                        <p>—He has reviewed the matter to some extent already.</p>
                        <p>—Basic attitude in the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> is that Japan
                            has to sign the treaty because of advantages of it as a whole and the
                            situation with the developing countries.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> and U.S.
                                non-paper,<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">Not found.</note> raise other
                            aspects and problems with the treaty that will be considered before
                            making a final decision on signing.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. is a leading nation in seabed mining, whereas Japan is a
                            latecomer.</p>
                        <p>5. In response to <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>’s
                            query as to whether the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> had in
                            effect already made up its mind to sign, <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> clarified that the cabinet has not taken a
                            decision yet but he understands the basic direction is toward
                            signing.</p>
                        <p>6. When <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> stressed
                            possibility of delaying a decision on signing to see what the Europeans
                            (particularly <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) are doing and, given the importance
                            of the issue and President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName>’s concerns, to have a chance of discussing it
                            during his visit to Washington, <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> replied that:</p>
                        <p>—He cannot deny that there is that possibility.</p>
                        <p>—He wants to consider the issue personally since President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> has sent <persName
                                corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> as an emissary to discuss
                            it.</p>
                        <p>—They have not had time yet to review matter thoroughly.</p>
                        <p>7. At subsequent meeting and dinner hosted by Foreign Minister Abe; in
                            response to <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>
                            presentation Abe noted that:</p>
                        <p>—Former cabinet’s basic position was that Japan will sign the treaty and
                            present government is still an <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>
                            cabinet, even though Prime Minister has changed.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> understands U.S. position.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. and Japan should take concerted steps on all major issues in
                            alliance, but differ on Law of the Sea.</p>
                        <pb facs="0578" n="532" xml:id="pg_532"/>
                        <p>—He will look into the matter and consult with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> to see what can be done. They
                            will bear in mind January visit.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> wants to work closely
                            with us to solve outstanding problems and hopes for a successful
                            bilateral summit in January.</p>
                        <p>8. In private conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1"
                                >Rumsfeld</persName> after dinner, Abe said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s sending an emissary has
                            signified importance of <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> issues and,
                            as result, he will recommend that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> carefully consider option of delaying signature of
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName> comment: If Japan
                            decides to delay signature, which is still a long shot, it will do so
                            solely for political reasons vis-a-vis U.S. That makes it all the more
                            important for the President and SecState to include law of the sea in
                            January meetings. It also argues for prompt expert level meetings to
                            begin to develop a rationale in <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            bureaucracy for not signing <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> that is
                            based on more than simply their desire not to be crossways with <gloss

                        <p>The United States has sent a small technical level delegation to attend
                            the final session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of
                            the Sea (<gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III) currently
                            taking place in Montego Bay December 6–December 10, at which those
                            States which participated in <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss>
                            III will be invited to sign the Final Act of the Conference. The
                            Convention will be opened for signature following signing of the Final
                            Act on December 10. It will remain open for signature for two years.</p>
                        <p>The United States, which will sign the Final Act, thereby attests that
                            the Convention in its six official linguistic texts is, in fact, that
                                <pb facs="0579" n="533" xml:id="pg_533"/> negotiated during the law
                            of the sea negotiations. The signing of the Final Act implies no legal
                            consequences for the U.S. The U.S. may offer statements on the record in
                            plenary as to the meaning of textual provisions, in response to
                            interventions by other States, if needed. We are thus able to protect
                            the US juridical position with regard to law of the sea.</p>
                        <p>The United States Delegation has met with a number of delegations to
                            date. Japan has stated it will not sign the Convention at Montego Bay,
                            and will at the earliest be able to do so at the end of January. Peru
                            has announced that it will not sign the Convention in Montego Bay,
                            primarily due to the fact that the Convention would deprive Peru of its
                            200-mile territorial sea. Peruvian President Belaunde has called for a
                            debate and subsequent national consensus as a prerequisite to signature.
                            In that Peru was one of the foremost proponents of the Treaty in its
                            formative stages this is a promising development from the US vantage, as
                            most South American coastal states share Peru’s coastal orientation.
                            Thus far at least the following countries will not sign the Convention
                            in Jamaica: The U.S., the U.K., the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss>, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Israel, Turkey, Argentina, Ecuador
                            and Peru.</p>
                        <p>Further, Canada, having been informed of our strong objections to certain
                            portions of their proposed plenary statement which would have been
                            adverse to our navigation interests, agreed to excise some of the
                            offending portions.<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">See <ref target="#d191"
                                    >Document 191</ref>.</note> Foreign Minister McEachen, the
                            Canadian head of delegation, delivered that statement on December 6. The
                            Canadian statement as delivered, emphasized the concept of a “package
                            deal” and the Canadian view that the transit passage through
                            international straits provisions of the treaty are a major inducement to
                            signing.</p>
                        <p>In furtherance of our private resolve to keep to a minimum the number of
                            States signing the Convention (as contrasted with the Final Act) at
                            Montego Bay, we are making separate demarches to Uruguay, Chile, and
                            South Korea.<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">The Department transmitted the

                        <p>(U) 1. The financial report cleared 5th Comm on Thursday, 2 Dec with a
                            price tag of $4.3 million for 1983. The vote in the 5th Comm was 92 for,
                            3 against, 19 abstain.</p>

                            Argentina, Israel, U.S. and Turkey made statements. Argentina again

                            III and elected not to partake in the voting. Israel stated their

                            the demands of the draft resolutions were contrary to international law.

                        <p>(U) 4. Votes were taken as follows:</p>

                            7 abstain (Belgium, Ecuador, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,

                            to abstention)</p>
                        <p>(C) 5. The voting went as expected. The only observations worth noting
                            are that Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela did not participate in vote
                            but were present; neither <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> or
                            Belgium voted against operative para 3, despite U.K.’s position; and
                            Ecuador’s consistant abstentions throughout voting. Peru’s votes (all
                            with majority) seem out of step with its announcement that it would not
                            sign in Montego. The most likely explanation is that the decision did
                            not reach the U.N. delegation in time.</p>
                        <p>(C) 6. Comment: Except for Canada and France, there are mild indicators
                            that many of the Western states are coming to the harsh realization that
                            the Prep Comm will be fully controlled by the Third World. The sterility
                            of <gloss target="#t_WEOG_1">WEOG</gloss> in the financial negotiations
                            was felt by all. The Third World horse has taken the bit between its
                            teeth. The sole reason any concessions were made at all was <persName
                                corresp="#p_KTT_1">Koh</persName>’s influence and ability to use the
                            threat of losing the industrialized states, and particularly the Soviet
                            bloc, at this final stage of the proceedings. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KTT_1">Koh</persName> now fades from the scene. The
                            pressures for consensus and Soviet bloc resistance will be far less in
                            the Prep Comm. The inescapable fact that is finally surfacing is that
                            Western industrial states will have little influence in Prep Comm
                            decisions. End comment.</p>

                            subjects seem to become more difficult to handle in multilateral
                            processes like the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and the results
                            are more likely to clash with US interests and common sense. The seabed
                            mining provisions in the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> treaty may
                            be one of the most extreme examples.</p>
                        <p>The mission as your special emissary was to raise <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> from the level of experts, who had
                            helped create the problem over the past 10 years, to the top political
                            level—the only level where we had a chance of averting a damaging
                            outcome at this late date. The specific objective was to dissuade key
                            allies from signing the treaty when it opened for signature. To this
                            end, we traveled to five countries and discussed <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> with President Mitterrand, Chancellor
                                <persName corresp="#p_KH_1">Kohl</persName>, Prime Ministers

                        <p>The reception accorded the mission shows the importance of the US to
                            these countries and the respect extended to you personally. As expected,
                            the reactions of these leaders varied. <persName corresp="#p_TM_1"
                                >Thatcher</persName> was most impressive and correctly labeled
                                <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> “an international
                            nationalization of the seabeds.” Conversely, Mitterrand expressed no
                            concern about the offensive aspects of the treaty and was unhelpful.
                            (France had announced its decision to sign the treaty before the mission

                        <p>When the treaty was opened for signature on December 10 in Jamaica, of
                            the countries we targeted only France and the Netherlands signed it. The

                                >FRG</gloss>, Japan, Belgium and Italy did not sign. Notably, only

                            (France) signed.</p>
                        <p>A favorable outcome for US policy in this area will require proper
                            follow-up. The treaty is open for signature for two years and the

                            begin working on the rules and regulations in a few months. The major
                            industrialized countries will continue to be under pressure to sign from
                            their own <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> experts and from Third
                            World countries. Over 110 countries signed the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Your involvement, Mr. President, will be needed to counter such pressure,
                            especially during your January 18 meeting with <persName

                            as the pressures to sign in Japan are strong. Continuing involvement by
                            the Secretaries of State, Defense and the Treasury will be necessary as
                            well. Finally, the US must develop and present a more definite and
                            detailed alternative to <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> for major
                            seabed mining countries. Without that, the risk of their signing the
                            treaty late next year will be greater.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Allied Relations</hi>. Four of the seven key allies you
                            asked me to visit underwent a change of government since the mission was

                            countries that are most important to the US. That extraordinary pace of
                            political change is generally not a healthy sign for stability in free

                        <p>The mission’s outcome suggests again that the US can have a positive

                            when the US adopts a policy that is sound, lends Presidential prestige
                            to it and takes the issues to the top leaders in these countries on a
                            timely basis. The US effort and mission on <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> gave heart to those in and out of government in these

                            to make general political statements. The vast majority welcomed the
                            adoption of the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention and
                            expressed their strong support for it. Many appealed to the US and to
                            others to sign the convention. Few speakers made formal interpretive
                            statements. A large number of delegates criticized those countries who
                            sought to quote pick and choose unquote among provisions of convention
                            they wished to accept. Many specifically attacked the seabed quote

                            unhelpful. Macheachan made specific reference to quote new provisions on
                            transit passage through international straits. Unquote In oblique
                            reference to US, Macheachan said that if states may arbitrarily select

                            will see the end not only of our dream of a universal, comprehensive
                            Convention on Law of the Sea, but perhaps the end of any prospect for

                            Clingan to discuss proposed Greek interpretative statement on straits.
                            The Greeks advised that their statement would be tabled upon <pb
                                facs="0586" n="540" xml:id="pg_540"/> ratification (they were
                            noncommittal as to when this would occur). Clingan suggested that the
                            Greeks consider tailoring their statement to Article 38.1.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d191fn6">Article 38 of the Law of the Sea Treaty refers to
                                the right of transit passage through straits used for international
                                navigation.</note> The Greeks are concerned only about overflight
                            through the Kea and Euroea Straits (the corridor between Kea and Andros
                            Islands and the mainland). They are fearful that Turkey will increase
                            tensions in the Aegean with aircraft operating out of Istanbul, passing
                            close to Athens. The Greek Delegation informally discussed their
                            proposal with the Soviets who expressed no objection. Clingan was
                            noncommital in the proposal, pointing out that the US would be analyzing
                            all proposals to apply treaty provisions to specific geographic areas on
                            a case-by-case basis.</p>

                            attempt to determine the position of the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"

                            international law rather than Indonesian consent. <gloss

                            he indicated that it may be too soon to pursue discussions. Clingan
                            pointed out that the US did not anticipate a change in the operation of
                            US forces and was willing to use the treaty provisions as the basis for
                            an understanding because we view those provisions as articulating
                            existing maritime practices. Clingan gave Mochtar a small map of the
                            Indonesian-claimed archipelago, annotated with potential sealanes.
                            Clingan concluded by once again urging prompt consideration by Indonesia
                            of the US offer for consultations.</p>
                        <p>12. (C) US Del met with Spanish Reps for brief and very general
                            discussion of straits issue. It was clear that Spanish Del had no
                            specific instructions on straits and it appears new government has not
                            yet focused on question. US and Spanish Reps agreed on need to work
                            closely in future on this issue.</p>

                                >USSR</gloss> of the pitfalls of a contractual approach to the

                            Counsel O’Neill pointed out that, if key strait states refuse to sign,
                            the contract theory becomes a trap. Only by maintaining that the
                            navigation and overflight provisions reflect customary international law
                            can the right of transit passage be fully protected as against
                            nonsignatory bordering states. It was also pointed out that the
                            customary law argument is bolstered by the maritime practice of both the
                            US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and is consistent with <pb
                                facs="0587" n="541" xml:id="pg_541"/> the long-standing Soviet
                            position regarding rights of navigation and overflight through straits.
                            The points appeared to be sinking in as the meeting progressed, and
                            Soviets agreed to consider the issue further. From what they divulged
                            during the course of the discussion concerning the nature of their
                            intended plenary statement, the actual plenary statement two days later
                            appeared to have been altered to some degree away from the contractual
                            approach. The consultation could thus be viewed as a success and the
                            Soviets expressed the desire for continued consultations of this nature
                            in the future.</p>

                            plans. Canada understands that US is not in <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1"

                            proposed schedule for asserting U.S. rights against the following
                            categories of excessive claims: territorial sea claims of twelve miles
                            or less which contain special requirements not recognized by
                            international law (paragraphs 3.b. and 3.c. above); archipelagic claims
                            (paragraph 6 above), unrecognized historic claims (paragraph 1 above)
                            and nonconforming baselines (paragraph 2 above).<note n="3"

                            Security Affairs prior to execution by the Department of Defense. The
                            Department of State is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date list of
                            politically sensitive areas. In addition, the Department of State will
                            advise the Department of Defense if any transient political factors in a
                            littoral country which is not a politically sensitive area make it
                            inadvisable for a limited time to conduct an operation under this

                        <p>The purpose of establishing an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> is to
                            assert our rights and interests in a manner which could help the
                            development of international oceans law and bring within our
                            jurisdiction resources which are rightfully ours consistent with such
                            law. If this is carefully done so that the rights and jurisdiction
                            asserted by the US are within the parameters of the international law of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> as reflected in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention and take into consideration
                            the concerns of our allies and other key States, we have the opportunity
                            to encourage the practice of other States along similar lines and
                            thereby to encourage customary international law to develop in a manner
                            acceptable to us.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> evolved during the Third United
                            Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (<gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1"
                                >UNCLOS</gloss> III) as a compromise between those States oriented
                            toward the establishment of jurisdiction and sovereign rights over
                            marine areas off their coasts (including Latin American claimants of 200
                            nautical mile territorial seas) and those States more oriented toward
                            the maintenance of traditional freedoms of the seas beyond a narrow
                            territorial sea. The essential compromise worked out in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention is that, in an
                            exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from the coast, the
                            coastal State is entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction
                            over the conservation and management of the living and non-living
                            resources of the area; in return, all other high seas freedoms, such as
                            freedoms of navigation and overflight and related uses of the zone
                            remain intact.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention elaborates
                            the resource related jurisdiction, the pollution jurisdiction, and the
                            marine scientific research jurisdiction that may be exercised; it does
                            not, unfortunately, elaborate as clearly the relationship of these
                            concepts to the freedoms of navigation and overflight and other related
                            uses in the zone. Thus, the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss>
                            III Convention leaves somewhat ambiguous the precise jurisdictional
                            parameters of the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>. Over 50 States
                            have already made <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> claims and many
                            more are likely to do so in the interim between opening the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention for signature and
                            its eventual entry into force, if that ever occurs. Some of these claims
                            are consistent with the Convention, others are not. Accordingly, State
                            practice, both within and outside of the Convention, will help to define
                            the content of the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> in international
                            law.</p>
                        <p>The application of appropriate policies in a US <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> would create a valuable precedent with respect to the
                            shaping of the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> as a feature of
                            international law. The <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> the US
                            creates should be consistent with the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1"
                                >UNCLOS</gloss> III principles which, on balance, reflect US
                            interests. Deviation from these principles, especially if the US were to
                            claim more extensive jurisdiction than permitted by the Convention,
                            could provoke others to do so with potentially adverse effects on our
                            commercial and military navigation interests. The proposed proclamation
                            is consistent with the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III
                            principles.</p>

                        <p>While the text of the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III
                            Convention provides for the establishment of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss>, it is also clear that the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> is widely regarded as a claim of jurisdiction whose
                            lawfulness is not dependent upon the Convention’s entry into force or a
                            claimant’s becoming a party to the Convention. There is a record of
                            State practice in support of such zones, generally consistent with, but
                            not dependent upon the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III
                                <pb facs="0598" n="552" xml:id="pg_552"/> Convention. The States
                            that have declared exclusive economic zones include some US allies
                            (France, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and Iceland). The International
                            Court of Justice stated in the <hi rend="italic">Tunisia-Libya
                                Continental Shelf Case</hi> that “the concept of the exclusive
                            economic zone . . . may be regarded as part of modern international
                            law”. (<gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> Reports 1982, para. 100.)
                            The American Law Institute also has (preliminarily) indicated that it
                            believes that the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> is part of
                            customary international law.<note n="5" xml:id="d195fn5">See <ref

                            Accordingly, a US claim of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> would
                            have a substantial basis in customary international law and its
                            lawfulness would not be subject to serious or sustained challenge by
                            other States. At the same time, we must recognize that if we make such a
                            claim, we are in no position to deny the rights of other States to make
                            similar claims. Indeed, it appears useful to stimulate claims conforming
                            to our own.</p>

                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> is a specific legal regime with
                            detailed, but also ambiguous, parameters. The jurisdictional content of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> as a matter of customary
                            international law has not crystallized. Some States have claimed more
                            control over activities in their <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>’s
                            than they could exercise under the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1"
                                >UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention: e.g., control over military
                            exercises; the laws of other States do not claim as much; and others
                            simply have not specified the rights they claim.</p>
                        <p>If we follow the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III
                            principles, we would enhance our position that other claims cannot be
                            inconsistent with our interpretation of the model.</p>
                        <p>We must also recognize that the legal basis for establishing an economic
                            zone cannot persuasively be distinguished from the legal basis
                            supporting any jurisdictional claim made by a coastal State that is
                            consistent with the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention.
                            Whether or not the US claims an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>, we
                            will not be able to argue credibly that a coastal State has no basis in
                            international law for establishing a 12-mile territorial seas which
                            affords to all States the navigational rights and freedoms specified in
                            the Convention. However, the legal basis of the traditional 3-mile
                            position will be maintained in all specific instances until the coastal
                            State in question demonstrates respect for our rights and freedoms.</p>

                        <p>There are two major areas of benefit for the US in the establishment of
                            an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>. One is the actual resource
                            jurisdiction that would be encompassed. The other is the valuable
                            precedential effect that could be <pb facs="0599" n="553"
                                xml:id="pg_553"/> created with respect to shaping the content of the

                            law.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> would not
                            materially affect present US fisheries and continental shelf
                            jurisdiction, which is complete as a matter of international law.
                            However, it would bring within the control of the United States
                            additional economic resource uses of the oceans within 200 nautical
                            miles of the United States’ coast. It would somewhat strengthen our
                            fisheries negotiating leverage. It would clearly establish US
                            jurisdiction and control over the minerals of the seabed beyond the
                            continental shelf out to 200 nautical miles, including polymetallic
                            sulphides and cobalt/manganese crusts which may be of substantial
                            commercial value in the future, and energy related uses from winds,
                            tides, waves and thermal energy conversion.</p>
                        <p>Under the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> concept, the coastal State may
                            establish significant jurisdiction over pollution and marine scientific
                            research in the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>. In the Convention,
                            the scope of coastal State control over marine scientific research is
                            extremely broad, and over pollution somewhat less so. Nevertheless, the
                                <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> has reviewed US marine science
                            and pollution control interests and determined that the US does not at
                            this time have a coastal interest in augmenting its present pollution
                            jurisdiction or asserting marine scientific research jurisdiction.
                            However, the US does have a strong interest in preventing coastal States
                            from using marine scientific research or, more likely, pollution
                            jurisdiction, to restrict the exercise of those traditional high seas
                            freedoms that the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> Convention,
                            as we interpret it, reserves for all States in the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>. It is in this area that the US can
                            set an example that would guide State practice towards acceptance of an
                                <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> regime whose pollution and
                            marine scientific research elements do not restrict the exercise of
                            these freedoms, but do protect legitimate coastal State interests.</p>
                        <p>An <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> proclamation would be seen by the

                        <p>A number of potential disadvantages exist to establishing an <gloss
                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> at this time. At a time when the US is
                            under attack by a number of countries for not signing the <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention, US declaration of an
                                <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> could hasten the adoption by
                            other countries of <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>’s that claim
                            greater jurisdiction than permissible under the US interpretation of the
                            Convention. Such excessive claims would be contrary to US interests and
                            could encourage challenges to US uses of the oceans. Establishment of an
                                <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> at this time could reinforce
                            the arguments of domestic and foreign critics of the Administration that
                            the US is picking and choosing from a package deal, trying to reap the
                            benefits while rejecting the <pb facs="0601" n="555" xml:id="pg_555"/>
                            burdens of the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention.
                            Establishment of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> now will be
                            seen by many Congressional critics of the Administration’s <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> policy as encouraging US isolation
                            from its responsibilities as a member of the international
                            community.</p>
                        <p>An <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> claim by the United States means
                            that we must accept comparable claims of other States. Thus, we would
                            have to concede resource jurisdiction off foreign coasts out to 200
                            nautical miles (except for jurisdiction over highly migratory species of
                            tuna). Although this means giving up a right to exploit seabed resources
                            beyond the continental shelf but within 200 nautical miles of a foreign
                            coast, it is most unlikely, in light of the clear trend in the law, that
                            US companies would spend the money to exploit resources in such areas
                            even if the US maintained its current position. Second, an <gloss
                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> claim concedes the right of the
                            coastal State to impose reasonable controls on marine scientific
                            research off its coast, unless such control is specifically disclaimed
                            in an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> assertion. This will require
                            closer cooperation with other States to allow research programs to
                            continue. Whether or not we assert an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss>, military research and other activities related to the
                            freedom of the high seas (and not subject to coastal State jurisdiction)
                            may be questioned by other nations. We must be firm in exercising our
                            rights in the face of such challenges. Third, the declaration of an
                                <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> could hasten claims of other
                            States to expansive pollution jurisdiction. However, these claims either
                            exist or are expected to arise regardless of whether we act.</p>

                            LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
                        <p>The precedent of the US claim to the Outer Continental Shelf supports the
                            view that the President can establish an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> by proclamation, rather than by legislation. In 1945,
                            President Truman proclaimed jurisdiction and control over the
                            continental shelf, but it was not until 1953 that legislation was passed
                            to provide a framework for the regulation of activities on the
                            shelf.</p>
                        <p>In balancing the President’s inherent foreign affairs powers against the
                            powers of the Congress to regulate interstate commerce under Article 1,
                            section 8 of the Constitution, the best conclusion, although by no means
                            the only defensible one, seems to be that the President could proclaim
                            US sovereign rights or control over the resources of an <gloss
                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>, but that only Congress may establish
                            a regulatory framework for the exploitation of resources, for the
                            protection of the marine environment, and for the conduct of marine
                            scientific research. This conclusion is reinforced by the record of
                            legislative action in several relevant areas, such as fisheries, the
                            continental shelf, ocean thermal energy conversion, deepwater ports and
                            marine pollution. The precise division <pb facs="0602" n="556"
                                xml:id="pg_556"/> between Presidential and Congressional authority
                            may be difficult to identify with certainty, but this much is clear:</p>
                        <p>1) By Proclamation the President could control resource related
                            activities by a foreign flag vessel beyond the continental shelf but
                            within 200 nautical miles of the coast.</p>
                        <p>2) By Proclamation the President could assert jurisdiction in general
                            terms, leaving for Congress the identification of its specific
                            content.</p>
                        <p>3) By Proclamation the President could not regulate the activities of US
                            nationals in these areas where there was not otherwise a statutory
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, any decision to proclaim an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> should be accompanied by a decision to begin the
                            process of implementing legislation. This would be achieved either by
                            drafting an Administration Bill or working closely with the Members of
                            Congress and Senators who have already introduced <gloss

                            would then have to promulgate regulations to implement the new law. We
                            will have to examine very carefully existing statutes to determine what
                            modifications are necessary or desirable as a result of the US
                            establishing an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>, including tax
                            consequences which may be substantial.</p>

                            control over fisheries within 200 nautical miles of the coast. The
                            present US law on highly migratory species of tuna within the 200 mile
                            zone varies from the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III
                            Convention as interpreted by a majority of States, in that the US
                            neither recognizes nor asserts unilateral jurisdiction over such tuna.
                            Any change in our tuna policy would be politically controversial and
                            would severely damage our distant-water tuna industry. The establishment
                            of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> would not affect the scope of
                            our laws, but would give us a stronger hand in fishery negotiations with
                            other States by establishing US sovereign rights in these resources.</p>

                        <p>A US <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> would incorporate existing US

                            are contemplated. The only question is the geographical outer limit. The

                            Continental Shelf to which the US is a party, is ambiguous. It would be
                            possible at this time—but is not necessary—to define specifically the
                            outer limits of the US continental shelf in those areas where it may
                            extend beyond 200 nautical miles.</p>

                            of whom consider it without merit. Insofar as the Gorda Ridge, which

                                >EEZ</gloss> would be that the United States would gain jurisdiction
                            over the resources of the seabed beyond the continental shelf but within
                            200 nautical miles of the coast. Recently discovered deposits of
                            polymetallic sulphides and cobalt/manganese crusts are not currently
                            commercially recoverable, but could be a major source of industrially
                            important strategic minerals in the future. The <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> will assert jurisdiction over all minerals (nodules,
                            sulfide deposits, hydrocarbons, etc.) in these areas. The Proclamation
                            will permit the US to control any foreign resource-related activities in
                            these areas. The Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act already governs
                            US citizens mining nodules in these areas as an exercise of a high seas
                            freedom. Additional legislation should be sought to establish exclusive

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> recommends that the US assert no
                            new jurisdiction over marine scientific research. The US will continue
                            to exercise existing controls over resource related research on the
                            continental shelf and within the fisheries zone. However, as a legal
                            matter, if the US adopts the concept of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss>, it must accept that the coastal State has jurisdiction
                            over marine scientific research in the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> (understanding that military activities are not within
                            the definition of marine scientific research). It is important to
                            clarify the distinction between marine scientific research, which is
                            subject to coastal State controls, and research related to other uses of
                            the high seas and embodied in the concept of freedom of navigation and
                            overflight, which is not subject <pb facs="0604" n="558" xml:id="pg_558"
                            /> to coastal State controls. This distinction is essential to preserve
                            our right to conduct military related research off the coasts of other
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The US scientific community has indicated that it is reluctantly willing
                            to accede to expanded coastal State jurisdiction over marine scientific
                            research in the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> if the US will seek
                            clearances from coastal States for such research. The Department of
                            State will submit such vessel clearance requests from US marine
                            scientists seeking to conduct marine scientific research programs in

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">5.</hi> Marine Pollution</p>
                        <p>The Clean Water Act, and other laws, provide for certain pollution
                            jurisdiction off the US coast at the present time. Without going into
                            detail, it may be said that the <gloss target="#t_UNCLOS_1"
                                >UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention provides a complex formula for an
                            exercise of significantly more coastal State jurisdiction, but this is
                            subject to dispute settlement procedures established under the
                            Convention. Our present jurisdiction is probably sufficient to meet our
                            own coastal needs for the foreseeable future. However, in light of the
                            interest of other States in asserting new pollution control jurisdiction
                            that could seriously affect and have a negative influence on continued
                            freedom of navigation and overflight in the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss>, in the future we may wish to consider establishing a
                            pollution jurisdiction that implements the principles of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention in this area.
                            There are essentially three aspects of this matter. Under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCLOS_1">UNCLOS</gloss> III Convention, the coastal
                            State has jurisdiction over the dumping of wastes (as defined) within
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>. By asserting an <gloss
                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>, we would be recognizing the rights of
                            others to control this activity. The Marine Protection Research and
                            Sanctuaries Act would require amendment to bring foreign dumping in a US
                                <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> under US regulatory authority
                            beyond the territorial sea and contiguous zone.</p>
                        <p>The second aspect of this matter is the port State’s authority to take
                            actions in port against foreign flag vessels that have violated
                            pollution regulations applicable to the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss>. The US has an interest in maintaining that such
                            regulations may only implement generally agreed international standards
                            and that the coastal State has no authority to adopt its own <hi
                                rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> standards. Our commercial shipping
                            interests would also benefit from a precedent created for prompt
                            resolution of any legal proceedings brought by the port State. The entry
                            into force of the International Convention for the Prevention of
                            Pollution from Ships of 1973 and the 1978 Protocol relating thereto in
                            October 1983 will, in large measure, together with other US laws, enable
                            the United States to structure a responsible pollution regime for the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss> that can influence other States
                            as they deal with this complicated question. At this time, it would be
                            appropriate to indicate our general intentions and to require further
                            study of this question.</p>
                        <pb facs="0605" n="559" xml:id="pg_559"/>
                        <p>The third aspect of this matter is the enforcement jurisdiction that the
                            coastal State may exercise against foreign flag vessels passing through
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>, but not entering a port. In
                            other words, to what extent and in conformity with what pollution
                            criteria may a coastal State enforcement authority stop, board, inspect,
                            and take control of a foreign flag vessel passing through the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEZ_1">EEZ</gloss>. Because of our navigation interests
                            the US objective is to see a very restricted State practice develop in
                            this area. At this time, it would be appropriate to indicate the US view
                            that such coastal State authority is extremely limited and goes no
                            further than the jurisdiction we presently have to intervene in the case
                            of marine disasters. This view need not be discussed at the present time
                            in either the Proclamation or the Policy Statement.</p>
                        <p>A marine pollution policy along these lines would be seen as responsive
                            to the development of international law; be a contribution to the
                            international community in developing a rational legal proposal in this
                            area; and would be protective of US resources and the coastal
                            environment. In structuring a marine pollution policy we would have the
                            opportunity to reaffirm our view that pollution jurisdiction is not
                            applicable to ships and aircraft entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>

                            its details to legislation. Present <gloss target="#t_OTEC_1"
                                >OTEC</gloss> legislation would need to be amended.</p>

                            zone as being beyond national territory, and the freedoms enjoyed by
                            foreign vessels and aircraft, should be acknowledged. We have an
                            interest in asserting leadership in this area (protecting rights off
                            foreign coasts by acknowledging their existence off our coasts), but at
                            the same time we have an interest in not creating such a strong record
                            that it causes an exaggerated reaction, creating a contrary record in
                            the end. We should indicate that the <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> is an area beyond the territory of the coastal
                            State.</p>
                        <p>There are two issues concerning resource zones of particular interest to
                            the Department of Defense: (1) the scope and nature of high seas
                            freedoms retained by the international community and (2) whether it is
                            to be regarded as a zone in which residual rights reside in the
                            international community or in the coastal State.</p>
                        <p>The importance to the United States in ensuring the retention of the
                            broadest scope and nature of traditional high seas freedoms in resource
                            zones extending out to 200 miles from foreign coasts is obvious. As to
                            the second issue, whether or not the zone is regarded <pb facs="0606"
                                n="560" xml:id="pg_560"/> as national territory is equally
                            important. It is a key in the determination of whether residual rights
                            reside with the international community or coastal state. Coastal state
                            arguments claiming control over foreign warships and aircraft would be
                            much greater if the zone were viewed as national in character, albeit
                            sui generis. Therefore, the US should protest all claims that purport to
                            assert “national zones” under the rubric of an <gloss target="#t_EEZ_1"
                                >EEZ</gloss> that do not protect high seas rights in the zone.</p>
                        <p>For practical purposes, the US assertion that the zone is not national
                            territory will help make it clear that the zone is not one wherein the
                            residual rights are nationalized. Such a US zone should not result in an
                            exaggerated reaction by others.</p>

                        <p>Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the US already has jurisdiction
                            over marine mammals within 200 miles of the US coast. The US has chosen,
                            as a matter of policy which is stated in the Marine Mammal Protection
                            Act, to exercise this jurisdiction in the case of fur seals and directed
                            take of cetaceans by deferring to management by international

                            The US has an opportunity to assert jurisdiction in a manner compatible

                            and structures having non-economic purposes. Setting this standard is
                            important to our non-navigational, military uses of foreign EEZs. The US

                        <p>• The United States is prepared to accept and act in accordance with the
                            balance of interests reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention relating
                            to traditional uses of the oceans, such as navigation and overflight. In
                            this respect, the United States will (1) recognize the rights of other
                            states in the waters off their coasts, as reflected in the Law of the
                            Sea Convention, so long as the rights and freedoms of the United States
                            and others under international law are recognized by such coastal
                            states; and (2), as indicated in National Security Decision Directive

                            navigation and overflight rights and freedoms in a manner that is
                            consistent with the results reflected in that Convention. (C)</p>
                        <p>• The United States will establish an Exclusive Economic Zone in which it
                            will exercise sovereign rights in the living and non-living resources,
                            except as qualified below, within 200 nautical miles of its coast.
                            (U)</p>
                        <p>• Within this zone all nations will continue to enjoy the high seas
                            rights and freedoms that are not resource related, including the
                            freedoms of navigation and overflight. (U)</p>
                        <p>• The establishment of such a zone will not change existing U.S. policies
                            with respect to marine mammals, the continental shelf and fisheries,
                            including highly migratory species of tuna. (U)</p>
                        <p>• The United States will continue efforts to reach agreements among
                            concerned countries for the effective management of highly migratory
                            species of tuna. (U)</p>
                        <p>These policy directions will not affect the application of existing
                            United States law concerning the high seas or existing authorities of
                            any U.S. government agency. (U)</p>

                            responsible for overseeing implementation of these decisions. It will
                            oversee and coordinate efforts to work with Congress to achieve
                            legislation to implement the Exclusive Economic Zone in a manner that
                            will be fully within the guidance established by this directive and
                            other related U.S. policies and not otherwise go beyond the Law of the
                            Sea Convention. This effort will include priority consideration to
                            introducing an Administration bill or package of amendments to bills
                            introduced in Congress. (U)</p>
                        <p>No agency will advance or seek to establish any new jurisdiction beyond
                            200 nautical miles, prior to review of any such proposals by the Senior
                            Interagency Group and, if there are significant policy implications,

                            the Law of the Sea Convention and to having our allies and others not

                            negotiating an agreement on deep seabed mining which could serve as an
                            alternative to the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention

                            Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan, we reached agreement in principle on

                            Bilateral talks were held in Tokyo in June and, as a result, we appear
                            to have settled our outstanding bilateral issues relating to the seabed

                        <p>Concurrently, the private seabed mining companies have been negotiating a
                            resolution of overlapping seabed mine sites. Negotiations have been
                            successfully concluded among the US and European-led consortia, and
                            negotiations between the US-European consortia and the Japanese have
                            begun. The initial results are encouraging. There seems to be a good
                            chance that the consortia will sign an arbitration agreement with the
                            Japanese in early September and, possibly, reach final resolution of
                            conflicts by the middle of December.</p>
                        <p>Most of the countries with which we have been negotiating have made no
                            decision yet on whether to sign a seabed mining agreement. That decision
                            will have to be made at high political levels, and the issue may be
                            controversial. The industrialized countries, particularly those which
                            have signed the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention, do not
                            want to be criticized for acting in bad faith by the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s and the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have told us they will not consider signing a
                            government-to-government seabed mining agreement until the negotiations
                            between the US-European consortia and the Japanese consortium are
                            successfully completed, and that if the U.S. and other countries go
                            ahead and sign the agreement without them, the Japanese would be
                            “forced”, for domestic political reasons, to criticize the agreement
                            publicly, thus excluding Japan from the agreement. As a result, there is
                            a close link between the government and the private sector
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the Law of the Sea Preparatory Commission will meet
                            again in Kingston for a four-week session beginning in August, although
                            most countries objected to Kingston as a site.<note n="5"

                        <p>2. The like-minded Group of Eight countries US, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, France, Japan,
                            Netherlands, Belgium and Italy, have agreed on the text of an agreement
                            on seabed mining: Provisional Understanding Regarding Seabed Matters. In
                            a series of extremely difficult and, at times heated negotiations Jan.
                            30–Feb one in The Hague, the issue between the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and Japan regarding the listing of the German AMR mine
                            site was resolved.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">In telegram 358701 to
                                Tokyo and London, December 19, 1983, the Department outlined the
                                dispute regarding the German mine site. (Department of State,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D830749–0153)</note> Once that problem
                            was disposed of, the remaining technical questions in the text were
                            quickly settled. During the negotiations certain changes were made to
                            the core provisions of the draft agreement. Therefore, as a formal
                            matter, all parties will review revised text to determine whether it is
                            acceptable. We do not expect any problems and, for practical purposes,
                            the final text of provisional understanding is completed and there will
                            be no further negotiations. Following negotiations a Japanese Rep raised
                            several minor drafting points with US Rep; these are the subject of a
                            separate message.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">In telegram 38279 to

                        <p>3. Next step will be completion of preparation of text in the other
                            official languages French, German, Italian, Japanese and Dutch. It was
                            agreed in The Hague that revised texts in these languages, reflecting
                            final text changes adopted February one, would be exchanged over next
                            two weeks. US agreed to coordinate language comparison. It has been left
                            open whether it will be necessary to convene a meeting to conform
                            various language texts.</p>
                        <p>4. France, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and Japan expressed
                            strong view that, because of the need to complete review of six language
                            texts, agreement could <pb facs="0612" n="566" xml:id="pg_566"/> not be
                            ready for signature before early March and that would be too close to

                            mid-March to mid-April. Japanese strongly urged that date of signature
                            be postponed until after Diet has recessed in late May. On a tentative
                            basis, it was agreed that seabed mining agreement should be opened for
                            signature in May or early June, 1984 in Geneva.<note n="4"

                                reported that French officials wished to postpone the signing of the
                                agreement until September because they believed the other seven

                        <p>5. Next major step will be political level review of agreement in
                            capitals. At The Hague meeting, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, US,
                            Italy and Belgian Representatives indicated they expected their
                            governments to sign. French and Japanese Representatives indicated that
                            they expected that agreement would be submitted to their cabinet with
                            recommendation to sign. Dutch and German Representatives were
                            noncommital. We expect political decision on signature to be made after
                            PrepCom, in late April–early May.</p>
                        <p>6. US and Italian experts reviewed Italian draft seabed mining law and
                            regulations. Some further communication will be necessary but we expect
                            to be in the position to designate Italy as a reciprocating state on
                            passage of Italian legislation and Italian signature of seabed mining
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>7. US held talks with Italian and Belgian Reps regarding side letter.
                            Italians and Belgians seemed essentially satisfied with latest US draft.
                            Italians suggested several changes which are acceptable. Belgians raised
                            some questions which will require further coordination. We expect in
                            next few weeks to propose revised draft of US letter based on these
                                exchanges.<note n="5" xml:id="d198fn5">In telegram 52577 to Rome,

                                    >Document 196</ref>.</note> Two important aspects of those
                            documents pertain to U.S. policy on freedom of navigation and are
                            reflected below. (C)</p>
                        <p>First, the United States is prepared to accept and act in accordance with
                            the balance of interests relating to traditional uses of the oceans—such
                            as navigation and overflight. In this respect, the United States will
                            recognize the rights of other states in the waters off their coasts, as
                            reflected in the Convention, so long as the rights and freedoms of the
                            United States and others under international law are recognized by such
                            coastal states. (U)</p>
                        <p>Second, the United States will exercise and assert its navigation and
                            overflight rights and freedoms on a worldwide basis in a manner that is
                            consistent with the balance of interests reflected in the Convention.
                            The United States will not, however, acquiesce in unilateral acts of
                            other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the
                            international community in navigation and overflight and other related
                            high seas uses. (U)</p>

                        <p>U.S. interests are to be protected against the following categories of
                            excessive maritime claims:</p>
                        <p>1. Those historic bay/historic water claims not recognized by the United
                            States. (U)</p>
                        <p>2. Those territorial sea baseline claims not drawn in conformance with
                            the customary international law reflected in the Law of the Sea (<gloss
                                target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss>) Convention. (U)</p>
                        <p>3. Those territorial sea claims not exceeding twelve nautical miles in
                            breadth that:</p>
                        <p>a. overlap straits used for international navigation and do not permit
                            transit passage in conformance with the customary international law
                            reflected in the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention,
                            including submerged transit of submarines, overflight of military
                            aircraft, and surface transit of warships/naval auxiliaries, without
                            prior notification or authorization, and including transit in a manner
                            of deployment consistent with the security of the forces involved;

                        <p>c. apply special requirements, not recognized by international law, for

                        <p>4. Territorial sea claims in excess of twelve nautical miles. (U)</p>
                        <p>5. Other claims to jurisdiction over maritime areas in excess of twelve
                            nautical miles, such as security zones, that purport to restrict
                            non-resource related high seas freedoms. (U)</p>
                        <p>6. Those archipelagic claims that either:</p>
                        <p>a. do not permit archipelagic sea lanes passage in conformance with the
                            customary international law reflected in the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1"
                                >LOS</gloss> Convention, including submerged passage of submarines,

                        <p>The Department of Defense will plan and administer the program under the
                            following procedures:</p>
                        <p>• The Department of Defense will submit in advance to the Department of
                            State and the Assistant to the President for National Security <pb
                                facs="0616" n="570" xml:id="pg_570"/> Affairs a proposed schedule
                            for asserting U.S. rights against the following categories of excessive
                            claims: unrecognized historic claims (paragraph 1 above), nonconforming
                            baselines (paragraph 2 above), and territorial sea claims of twelve
                            nautical miles or less which contain special requirements not recognized
                            by international law (paragraphs 3.b and 3.c above). Objections to the
                            schedule by the Department of State will be resolved by the Assistant to
                            the President for National Security Affairs. After a reasonable number
                            of assertions of U.S. rights against an excessive claim in any of these
                            categories, on the recommendations of the Departments of State and
                            Defense, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
                            may determine that advance scheduling to assert rights against these
                            claims will no longer be required. (C)</p>
                        <p>• Except for navigation in and over international straits (including
                            their approaches) and archipelagic sea lanes passage, when any assertion
                            of rights against an excessive claim will result in entry into a
                            politically sensitive area (<gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss>), the
                            Department of State and the Assistant to the President for National
                            Security Affairs will be notified of such operations prior to execution
                            by the Department of Defense. The Department of State is responsible, in
                            consultation with the Department of Defense, for maintaining an
                            up-to-date list of politically-sensitive areas. (C)</p>
                        <p>• International straits (paragraph 3.a. above) and archipelagic sea lanes
                            (paragraph 6.a. above) will be used by both military ships and aircraft
                            freely and frequently as directed by the Department of Defense. No prior
                            approval or <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss> notification of such
                            transits is required. (C)</p>
                        <p>• The Department of Defense will routinely assert U.S. rights against
                            territorial sea claims, other claims to jurisdiction over maritime areas
                            in excess of twelve nautical miles, and archipelagic claims not in
                            conformance with the <gloss target="#t_LOS_1">LOS</gloss> Convention,
                            (paragraphs 4, 5, and 6.b. above). No prior approval of such operations
                            is required, although <gloss target="#t_PSA_1">PSA</gloss> operations
                            require prior notification. (C)</p>
                        <p>• A Table summarizing the above guidance is attached as Tab 1 to this

                        <p>• The Department of State will advise the Department of Defense and the
                            Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs if any
                            transient political factors in a littoral country which is not a
                            politically sensitive area make it inadvisable for a limited time to
                            conduct an operation under this program. (C)</p>
                        <p>• The Department of State will continue to protest in diplomatic channels
                            the excessive claims of littoral countries. (U)</p>
                        <pb facs="0617" n="571" xml:id="pg_571"/>
                        <p>• In planning proposals for Freedom of Navigation operations which
                            require prior interagency approval, the Department of Defense should
                            consider the possible impact of frequent challenges upon bilateral
                            political relations between the affected littoral nations and the United
                            States. (C)</p>
                        <p>• Where possible, we should strive for a balanced challenge program which
                            contests the excessive claims or illegal regimes of allied or friendly
                            states, inimical powers, and neutral states alike. In sensitive areas,
                            the <gloss target="#t_FON_1">FON</gloss> program should be structured to
                            avoid conveying the impression that the United States favors one country
                            over another. (C)</p>
                        <p>• Special emphasis should be given to challenging claims which have no
                            record of prior challenge. (C)</p>

                            <salute>Dear <persName corresp="#p_GCE_1">George</persName>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>(C) The Joint Chiefs of Staff and I believe that extending the U.S.
                            territorial sea to 12 nautical miles and the outer limit of the
                            contiguous zone to 24 nautical miles would enhance the national security
                            and other essential interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>(C) We believe the most effective and expeditious way to achieve the
                            benefits of extending the territorial sea and contiguous zone is through
                            a Presidential proclamation. A Presidential proclamation would be
                            effective for foreign policy purposes when issued, and the improved
                            security that we seek from extending the U.S. territorial sea and
                            contiguous zone could be realized immediately. Congress and the
                            executive branch could address in due course domestic legal and resource
                            issues that would inevitably arise by virtue of the extension of U.S.
                            sovereignty and jurisdiction. We will participate fully in formulating
                            the legal regime within the extended maritime claims. Enclosed is a
                            draft Presidential proclamation (Annex A),<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2"
                                >Attached but not printed.</note> with accompanying Fact Sheet

                        <p>(C) Accordingly, I request you convene an Interagency Group on Ocean
                            Policy and the Law of the Sea, as soon as possible, to consider
                            recommending that the President sign a proclamation along the lines of
                            the enclosed proposal. I look forward to working closely with you on
                            this matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4">In a May 21 letter to <persName
