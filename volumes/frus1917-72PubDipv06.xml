                <p>This volume documents the public diplomacy efforts of the John F. Kennedy
                    administration. A major emphasis of the volume is the role the United States
                    Information Agency (USIA), led by Edward R. Murrow during this period, played in
                    presenting U.S. foreign policy objectives to the world during a time of social
                    change within the United States. The volume illustrates how USIA and the
                    Department of State pursued public diplomacy against the backdrop of crises,
                    including the Bay of Pigs invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall, Laos,
                    Vietnam, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Additional documentation chronicles the
                    Kennedy administration’s attempts to develop a national cultural policy, the
                    importance of overseas polling, and the Department of State’s educational
                    exchange activities.</p>
                <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Kristin L. Ahlberg and Charles V. Hawley.

                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss
                        target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department
                    of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government <pb
                        n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>agencies, departments, and other entities
                    of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or
                    support cooperate with the Department of State historians by providing full and
                    complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and
                    by providing copies of selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the
                    preparation of this volume have been declassified and are available for review
                    at the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II), in College
                    Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files are
                    available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and may be accessed
                    using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of the
                    Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to or are in
                    the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives
                    II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the presidential libraries and
                    other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been
                    declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The staff
                    of each presidential library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign-affairs
                    related documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and
                    other federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to
                    Washington time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>from the General Editor and the
                    Chief of the Editing and Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced as
                    exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are
                    described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to
                    accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents within the
                    limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for
                    each document included in this volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words and phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>series. The Advisory Committee monitors
                    the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all
                    aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this compilation, which began in 2015 and was
                    completed in 2017, resulted in the decision to withhold 0 documents in full,
                    excise a paragraph or more in one document, and make minor excisions of less
                    than a paragraph in one document.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this compilation and as a result of the declassification review
                    process described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented
                    here provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of public diplomacy
                    initiatives during the <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F. Kennedy</persName>
                    administration.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for <hi
                        rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>, Public Diplomacy, 1917–1972</p>
                <p>In 2007, historians at the Office of the Historian proposed a set of
                    retrospective <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> (<hi
                        rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) volumes designed to augment the series’ coverage of
                    U.S. public diplomacy. While the series began to document the subject in a
                    sustained and concerted way starting with the second administration of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>, previous <hi
                        rend="italic">FRUS</hi> coverage of U.S. public diplomacy efforts have been
                    far less consistent. These retrospective volumes will fill that gap, which
                    stretches from the First World War to the early 1970s. Resource constraints and
                    the statutory requirement to publish <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes 30 years after the events that they cover mean that compilations in
                    these volumes have been researched and compiled piecemeal over a longer period
                    of time than the typical <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume. Fortunately,
                    progress is being made. During the fall of 2004, the Office released the volume
                    covering the U.S. Government’s public diplomacy efforts from 1917 to 1919.
                    Subsequent compilations, which will document up to the end of the first
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration, will be
                    published as they are completed.</p>
                <p>This volume, covering the years 1961 to 1963 focuses on the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F. Kennedy</persName> administration’s efforts to
                    manage public diplomacy during the middle portion of the Cold war. It describes
                    how the United States Information Agency (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                    >USIA</gloss>) worked to present U.S. foreign policy objectives to the world
                    during a time of social change within the United States. The compilation also
                    illustrates how <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and the Department of
                    State pursued public diplomacy against the backdrop of crises, including the Bay
                    of Pigs invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall, Laos, Vietnam, and the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis. Additional documentation chronicles the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> administration’s attempts to develop a
                    national cultural policy, the importance of overseas polling, and the Department
                    of State’s educational exchange activities. The volume should be read in
                    conjunction with <ref target="frus1961-63v25"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                <p>The Presidential papers of <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F.
                        Kennedy</persName>, housed at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, are
                    a key source of high-level decision making documentation on public diplomacy. A
                    number of collections within the National Security File (<gloss
                        target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss>) are relevant to research in this area,
                    specifically the Departments and Agencies series, Meetings and Memoranda series,
                    and Subjects series. In addition, the President’s Office Files, specifically the
                    Departments and Agencies series, contains a substantial amount of documentation
                    regarding the United States Information Agency, including memoranda from <gloss

                <p>The National Archives and Records Administration also houses essential high-level

                    Department of State Record Group 59, the records of the Bureau of Educational
                    and Cultural Affairs are especially significant, as they contain the files of
                    the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs as well as
                    the records of the Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural
                    Affairs. Of great importance is Record Group 306, the records of the United
                    States Information Agency. These collections yield a substantial amount of
                    documentation on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s organizational
                    structure, as well as on program development, implementation, and evaluation.
                    The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Historical Collection includes
                    Subject Files (containing records relating to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                    </list>
                    <p>The long-range purpose of the Educational Exchange Program of the State
                        Department is to contribute to the raising of intellectual and educational
                        levels everywhere so that our way of life can be assured survival. Short
                        range, it resists Communist appeals by building into other countries a
                        broadly knowledgeable leadership class. Another short range effect is to
                        raise the technical competence in underdeveloped countries. It also makes
                        Americans more sophisticated about the world and our problems in it.</p>
                    <p>This program differs in interest and in kind from the technical assistance
                        and educational assistance programs of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>
                        which are specifically designed to contribute to economic development. But
                        as illiterate countries come into being, as in Africa, massive <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> assistance is put into general education
                        and educational institutions. This movement of <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"
                            >ICA</gloss> into the purely educational field has blurred the original
                        clear difference between the two programs.</p>
                    <p>The comparatively modest size of the State Department’s program is
                        misleading. It is highly selective. It is apportioned by countries according
                        to political judgments. It is carefully programmed. Its balance between
                        immediate and ultimate objectives is calculated. It combines U.S. dollars,
                        foreign currencies and private contributions, thus making <pb n="2"
                            facs="0039" xml:id="pg_2"/>up a pattern of complicated cooperative
                        grants. It also stimulates and services a variety of non-government
                        exchanges.</p>
                    <p>The Department does as little as possible itself but contracts student
                        placement, programming of foreign visits, examinations, etc., to private
                        institutions. Its relationships with contractors are generally good, but
                        Government accounting practices are an irritation and some of the
                        contractors have become high-powered pressure groups with a vested interest
                        in the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The principal advisory and cooperative groups assisting the program are the

                    <p>The principal handicaps are:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. Rigidity in law (and interpretation of law).</item>
                        <item>2. Chronic shortage of funds.</item>
                        <item>3. Weak leadership, reflecting lack of real State Department interest
                            in this arm of foreign policy. The geographical (political) bureaus of
                            State know little and care less about the program.</item>
                        <item>4. Impending shortage of U.S. educational resources for overseas
                            activity, a reflection of lack of national attention to our educational
                            establishment.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> has conferred with
                        Government and educational officials and has asked for suggestions for
                        drafting new comprehensive legislation for the exchange program, addressed
                        principally at point one above. There are now unnecessary built-in
                        restrictions, due partly to legislative and appropriations language, that
                        make it difficult to assure the foreigner an adequate experience in the U.S.
                        The Bureau of the Budget recently added to these restrictions by putting
                        foreign currencies for this program into the dollar appropriations
                        process.</p>
                    <p>The program needs strong, convinced leadership.</p>
                    <p>The ideal position in the Government for the exchange program would be close
                        to the State Department for policy guidance, but outside its administrative
                        control, as in the Information Agency (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>). The <pb n="3" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_3"/>State
                        Department’s administration is not equipped to handle contracts and
                        complicated fiscal relationships with private institutions.</p>
                    <p>The educational exchange work of the State Department is closely akin to the
                        cultural work of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. These programs
                        could be brought together. If related to the State Department and operated
                        together, they need administrative autonomy for efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The question of the relationship of the Department’s exchange program to
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> educational programs should be made
                        clear. The appointment of a Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for
                        inter-agency educational and cultural coordination did not achieve this
                        purpose, since his role has not been accepted outside the State Department
                        itself. This relationship with <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> is
                        increasingly important because many of the new and expanding programs can be
                        authorized either through economic aid or educational exchange depending
                        upon the emphasis, funding source and operating responsibility intended.</p>
                    <p>The present level of the educational exchange program is $23.2 million in
                        dollars and $19 million in foreign currencies. This is far short of
                        requirements to meet needs and opportunities country by country. There
                        should be a regular annual increase of hard dollar appropriations and a
                        considerable immediate increase in foreign currency availability. Coupled
                        with greater flexibility of use, this could begin to meet program needs and
                        produce a better program, which is even more desirable than greater numbers.
                        A freer use of excess foreign currencies is required to stabilize and
                        improve present programs and for overseas expansion, particularly into new
                        fields such as educational centers, regional universities and
                        institutes.</p>
                    <p>Educational institutions abroad, created and supported by the United States
                        and largely financed by foreign currencies owed the U.S., would vastly
                        expand our influence and our objectives. They would help fill the
                        educational vacuum the U.S.S.R. is trying to fill while it draws off
                        potential free leadership into Soviet educational institutions. They need
                        not be standard universities in all cases, but carefully designed to meet
                        national and regional needs. This offers the best chance for expansion of
                        our programs at low cost, and without over-burdening our own schools.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                    <p>1. All overseas psychological (information, cultural, educational) operations
                        of the U.S. Government should be grouped together in one organization.</p>
                    <p>2. This organization should take its policy guidance from the State
                        Department but should be independently administered and not a part of State
                        or any other agency.</p>
                    <p>3. This organization should be the overseas psychological instrument of the
                        U.S. Government. It should have close relations with the White House (which
                            <hi rend="italic">decides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">speaks</hi> on
                        foreign policy) as well as the State Department (which <hi rend="italic"
                            >implements</hi> that policy).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PURPOSE</p>
                    <p>It should be the purpose of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to further
                        the achievement of U.S. foreign policy objectives by:</p>
                    <p>1. Using communications techniques (personal contact and exchanges,
                        libraries, press, radio, motion pictures, television, fairs and <pb n="5"
                            facs="0042" xml:id="pg_5"/>exhibits, lectures, book publishing and
                        others) to promote climates of public opinion abroad which will enhance the
                        prospects of achieving these objectives through diplomatic means.</p>
                    <p>2. Projecting to the world an image of a strong, democratic, dynamic America
                        which is serving the interests of free peoples and is worthy of their
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>3. Advising the President and the State Department on the reactions of
                        foreign peoples to, and the consequences of, proposed U.S. policies,
                        programs and official statements. Repeated propaganda defeats in recent
                        years, notably our handling of the U–2 affair<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">On

                        of the U.S. Government overseas, just as State is its diplomatic instrument

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">GENERAL ORGANIZATION</p>
                    <p>The consensus of best-informed opinion, with which I fully agree, is that all

                        together in one organization.</p>

                        concluded that a separate agency is more likely to generate “high vitality”
                        and a “sense of urgency,” and also is more likely to achieve a vigorous,
                        imaginative program and effective administration of the distinctive tasks
                        involved.” Both groups oppose putting <hi rend="italic">operations</hi> into

                    <p>Former <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Director <persName
                            corresp="#p_STC_3">Streibert</persName> wrote me: “It is completely
                        clear to me from my experience in 1953 to 1956 that information activities
                        should not be incorporated within the State Department, but should continue
                        as an independent agency . . . These operations are foreign to its (State’s)
                        field of diplomacy . . . A separate agency can develop greater competence in
                        both personnel and methods if it has a single objective and is not diverted
                        by being part of another organization. The proponents of moving <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> back into State are never explicit, at
                        least to my knowledge, as to what currently is so wrong . . . as to require
                        a fundamental change. It has been especially established overseas that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> country staffs do work well under
                        the Chief of Mission and as part of the country diplomatic
                        establishment.”</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> staffs
                        abroad are thoroughly integrated in the Embassy establishment and, as Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STC_3">Streibert</persName> points out, work under
                        the direction of the Chief of Mission. Integration overseas is essential for
                        a coordinated approach; independence of operations (though not of policy) is
                        equally essential at home for a vigorous, effective program.</p>
                    <p>The top career man in State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, who

                        this view. In a memorandum discussing his particular field of interest he
                        stated: “The ideal position in the Government for the exchange program would
                        be close to the State Department for policy guidance but outside <pb n="8"
                            facs="0045" xml:id="pg_8"/>its administrative control, as in the
                        Information Agency. The (State) Department’s administration is not equipped
                        to handle contracts and complicated fiscal relationships with private
                        institutions . . . If (information and exchange programs are) related to the
                        (State) Department and operated together, they need administrative autonomy
                        for efficiency.”<note n="9" xml:id="d2fn9">The memorandum was not

                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should:</p>
                    <p>1. Have experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign peoples. In
                        particular they should comprehend the “revolution of rising expectations”
                        throughout the world, and its impact on U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>2. Be pragmatic, open-minded and sensitive to international political
                        currents, without being naive.</p>
                    <p>3. Understand the potentialities of propaganda while being aware of its
                        limitations.</p>
                    <p>4. Be able to apply the psychological factor in the determination of policies
                        affecting our relations with other nations. That is, they should be able to
                        advise on the reactions of foreign peoples to, and the consequences of,
                        proposed U.S. policies and programs.</p>
                    <p>5. Have a clear understanding of, and loyalty to, the President’s
                        program.</p>
                    <p>6. Have qualities of leadership, be able and decisive executives, men who are
                        impatient with inefficiency.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the <hi rend="italic">Director</hi> should have the personality
                        and the public stature which would enable him to deal amicably and
                        effectively with Congress and the American people. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >Deputy Director</hi> should be a professional propagandist, preferably
                        with overseas experience, and should have the confidence of—and the ability
                        to work with—the President’s policy advisers and press secretary. (The

                    <p>This report is highly selective. It covers five areas of <gloss

                    <p>The new administration should determine, as soon as possible, the position it

                        governmental framework. This decision will put to rest an uncertainty that
                        now exists throughout the Agency. This uncertainty results from the fact
                        that during the <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>
                        administration the information program was the responsibility of the State
                        Department, and during the <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> administration it was the responsibility of the

                    <p>There are three principal proposals for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>:</p>

                        applicants seeking to join the Agency has greatly increased. To re-integrate
                        the Agency into State would destroy the esprit which has slowly been
                        growing.</p>
                    <p>The principal argument favoring re-integration into the State Department
                        appears to be that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> may, as time goes
                        on and its influence increases, attempt to enter the policy-making area and
                        thus embarrass the U.S. government. This could happen. But it has not
                        happened in the past seven years and there is no reason why it should happen
                        if the President makes it plain to the Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> that policy decisions come <hi rend="italic">only</hi>
                        from the White House and the State Department.</p>
                    <p>The chief argument against granting Cabinet rank to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> is that it would inevitably lead to conflict with the
                        State Department. The State Department is the foreign <hi rend="italic"
                            >policy</hi> arm of the government. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> is the <hi rend="italic">organizational</hi> arm whose
                        duty it is to explain and promote that policy. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, not being a policy maker, should remain in a subordinate
                        role to State. However, it should always be able to offer its views on the
                        international psychological effects of policies before they are put into
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>Another decision requiring prompt action concerns the scope of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s responsibilities. There are many,
                        including myself, who feel that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> overseas
                        psychological operations (information, educational, and cultural) should be
                        grouped under <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Currently there are
                        two important programs that are outside of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s sphere. One is administered by the State Department, the
                        other by the Commerce Department.</p>
                    <p>1) The State Department administers all educational exchange (<persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>) and cultural programs under its
                        Bureau of Educational and Cultural Relations. Although this Bureau is
                        responsible for selecting the people who go abroad under these programs,
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> gets the job making their
                        arrangements and shepherding them once they get overseas. This is an awkward
                        and cumbersome arrangement. These exchange and cultural programs, which fall
                        under the heading of over<pb n="11" facs="0048" xml:id="pg_11"/>seas
                        psychological operations, should be taken out of State and put under <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. This might prove difficult to get
                        through the Senate, however, since the original divorce of the exchange
                        programs from the information programs was initiated by Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>. He presumably feels the same
                        today.</p>
                    <p>2) The Commerce Department administers the international fair and exhibit
                        programs with the “coordination” of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.
                        Some international fairs and exhibits are truly “commercial” and devoted to
                        the promotion of products. But many, i.e., the 1959 Agricultural Fair in New
                        Delhi, are more truly cold war competitions, using “commercial” products as
                        trappings behind which each nation tries to promote its own image. The
                        psychological importance of these fairs and exhibits far outweigh the
                        commercial importance and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be
                        given primary responsibility for the entire program with Commerce put in the
                        subsidiary role.</p>
                    <p rend="center">PROGRAMS</p>
                    <p>This section picks out the two most crucial regional areas of Africa and
                        Latin America for brief examination and makes some program recommendations.
                        It also picks out two tremendously useful tools—science and television—and
                        offers some ideas on how they might be used to better advantage.</p>
                    <p>A) AFRICA—At the present we have 31 <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        posts in 20 African countries. By June 30, 1961 there will be 12 new posts
                        opened in 11 more African countries. These figures illustrate the kind of
                        African operation that currently dominates <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>: secure a foothold in every new country. We will only have
                        98 Americans manning those 43 posts by June 30, 1961, which indicates what a
                        slim foothold it is.</p>
                    <p>This foothold operation is obviously necessary and the new administration
                        should support it wholeheartedly by giving it sufficient funds to staff it
                        with the proper personnel and physical equipment. But we must also look
                        ahead and anticipate the type of programs that will prove the most effective
                        in Africa. Here are three programs that appear particularly promising.</p>
                    <p>1) <hi rend="italic">English Language Teaching</hi>—The new leadership and
                        the intellectual elite of all French Africa is hungry to learn English. In
                        that hunger lies an enormous opportunity for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> that we must exploit. The possibilities are tremendous.
                        For example, in answer to an urgent State Department call, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> opened an Information Center in Bamako,
                        Mali this Fall. The Public Affairs Officer had no sooner arrived than he was
                        asked to set up an English class in the Presidential palace. His students
                        today: The President<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6"><persName corresp="#p_KM_1"
                                >Modibo Keita</persName>.</note> and his wife, three cabinet
                        ministers and their <pb n="12" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_12"/>wives, the Mayor,
                        and three high officials of the Foreign Ministry. In the Congo, where the
                        teaching program is only two months old, 150 are enrolled, including several
                        Chiefs. In Guinea, where most <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        operations are being curtailed by the pro-Communist government, the English
                        teaching program is specifically exempted and the students include several
                        cabinet and sub-cabinet officials. We should begin extensive recruiting of
                        qualified American teachers who speak French to move into this vacuum.
                        Equally as important, we should plan to supply all French Africa with
                        American textbooks on the basic subjects. To backstop that, excellent
                        libraries should be set up to maintain and nourish the interest in the
                        English language. This program should be viewed as a <hi rend="italic"
                            >long-term</hi> project of 20 or 30 years through which we can exert
                        great influence on the present and future leaders of Africa.</p>
                    <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Radio Broadcasting</hi>—The Communist and pro-Communist
                        radios of Moscow, Peking, and Cairo broadcast 100 hours a week of African
                        programs to African audiences. Voice of America broadcasts 7 hours of
                        African programs a week, most of it with a weak signal from Munich and
                        Tangier. It now appears practically certain that we will be forced out of
                        Tangier by the Moroccan government at the end of 1963. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> signed an agreement with Liberia in
                        October, 1959 to build a powerful short-wave relay station there but
                        appropriations were not forthcoming until July of 1960. When completed in
                        the summer or fall of 1963, at the cost of $13 million, the Liberian station
                        will blanket all of Africa with a clear signal. Under present plans <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will have no effective radio signal into
                        Africa until that time.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has made what it
                        describes as a “comprehensive study” of the possibilities of putting two
                        35kw transmitters that they now own into the Liberian site as an interim
                        measure. Their study indicated that this would take one year, cost $1
                        million, provide a signal too weak to be of much use south of Guinea and
                        would substantially slow down the construction of the permanent relay
                        station in Liberia. They rejected the idea.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has long hoped to buy a portable relay
                        station consisting of one 50kw medium wave transmitter and three 50kw
                        shortwave transmitters. This can be built in eleven months and can be moved
                        to any point in the world in two or three weeks. The cost is $1.8 million.
                        It would cover a fairly wide portion of Africa. I recommend that <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> asks Congress for a special
                        appropriation this year to build such a portable transmitter. I further
                        recommend it be set up in Liberia in early 1962 to cover at least a year and
                        a half of the gap before completion of the permanent station. Because it is
                        portable, it will not interfere with the construction of the permanent
                        station. Once the permanent station is in use, the portable one can be used
                        in another important <pb n="13" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_13"/>area or put in
                        reserve for emergency use (i.e., the Lebanon crisis,<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d3fn7">Reference is to the 1958 crisis that led to the

                            Jordan.</note> where a portable station would have been invaluable.)</p>
                    <p>3) <hi rend="italic">African Students in Europe</hi>—There are now over
                        20,000 African students in England and France and nearly that number in
                        Germany. These are the future leaders of Africa, forming the opinions and
                        ideas that they will take back home and put into practice. The Communists
                        are hard at work organizing clubs, discussion groups, holding special
                        lectures and seminars for them. We should surpass the Communists in this
                        activity.</p>

                        triggered <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> into stepping up its
                        program there although it still is inadequate. Unlike Africa, there are long
                        established posts in most of the major cities. Current <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> activity is directed toward
                        strengthening personnel, library, press, motion picture, television and
                        radio operations. Here are three programs which need particular
                        attention:</p>
                    <p>1) <hi rend="italic">Student and Labor Groups</hi>—There are two leadership
                        groups in Latin America upon which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        should concentrate. One group is the students who represent a powerful
                        political entity today in most Latin American countries. The other group is
                        the labor leaders whose power has been growing rapidly in spite of efforts
                        by ruling oligarchies to hold them down.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has made a start at the establishment
                        of nine new Community centers for labor and students. They have also made a
                        start in asking for special <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> student
                        and labor “Information Officers” who will be specially trained in their
                        fields as well as in Communist strategies normally employed to subvert such
                        groups. Both of these programs should be expanded so <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will be better able to deal with these
                        two new power elites.</p>
                    <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Radio Broadcasting</hi>—<gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> began its first short wave broadcast to Latin America in
                        March 1959. Today <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is broadcasting only
                        seven hours a week directly to Latin America and seven hours of
                        re-broadcast. The Budget for Fiscal Year 1962 calls for an extra seven hours
                        a week. Meanwhile the Communists are broadcasting 163 hours a week into
                        Latin America. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> argues that short wave
                        is not popular and it is more effective to place packaged programs on medium
                        wave commercial stations. However, this medium wave placement is always
                        subject to restriction by an unfriendly government. Short wave is not. My
                        recommendation would be to increase short wave to 42 hours a week.</p>
                    <p><pb n="14" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_14"/>Cuba receives the same single hour of
                        short wave that the rest of Latin America receives. Medium wave broadcasts
                        into Cuba have been considered but rejected because they would violate the
                        North American Broadcasting Agreement of which we and other North American
                        nations are signators. Furthermore, if we attempted to direct a propaganda
                        broadcast at Cuba they could easily turn some 50 of their 148 transmitters
                        on us and badly foul up the American airwaves along the East Coast. From the
                        “Voice” point of view, we are currently stymied in our relations with
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>3) <hi rend="italic">Television</hi>—Latin America has 3.3 million television
                        sets today with an estimated audience of 15 million (4 million each in
                        Mexico and Brazil). <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has only one
                        weekly 15-minute news show which is sent to all <gloss target="#t_TV_1"
                            >TV</gloss> countries and viewed by 10 million people. If this estimate

                    <p>The Task Force is under no illusions that any modifications in the
                        information and cultural machinery of government can reverse the unfavorable
                        trends in the psychological position of the United States abroad. We cannot
                        put a good face on unsound or inadequate policies or unwise actions by
                        information or cultural operations, let alone by slogans or propaganda
                        gimmicks.</p>

                            Recommendations</hi></p>
                    <p>Fundamentally, the decline in United States prestige can be arrested only by
                        more dynamic Presidential leadership, a much clearer sense of our national
                        purposes, sound substantive policies and better coordinated programs for
                        accomplishing them. Among important specifics, reversal of the recent trend
                        will require that the United States</p>
                    <p>1) adopt a posture toward the world and its problems, and pursue policies and
                        programs motivated by considerations more positive than mere
                        anti-communism;</p>
                    <p>2) identify itself in a more vital way with “the revolution of rising
                        expectations” now sweeping the world, rather than continue to be identified
                        as the defender of the status quo;</p>
                    <p>3) use all of its programs in the underdeveloped areas (including its
                        information and cultural activities) to develop frameworks of free
                        governments, within which the aspirations of the people can ultimately be
                        met;</p>
                    <p>4) come to terms with the spirit of nationalism (and concomitant feelings
                        about racism) which constitutes the most powerful emotional force now at
                        work in the Afro-Asian countries;</p>
                    <p>5) do a more effective and imaginative job of waging the psychological war
                        against Communism behind the Iron Curtain, rather than continuing to allow
                        the Communists to choose psychological battle grounds on Free World
                        territory, with relatively little disruption behind their lines.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Need to Consider Psychological Effects</hi></p>
                    <p>The Task Force is fully aware that foreign reactions cannot be the
                        controlling element in the formulation of substantive United States
                        policies; that measures in the furtherance of America’s broader interests
                        may be unpopular in certain parts of the world; that psychological
                        considerations are not separable from political ones and are only one of the
                        factors that must be considered in the evolution of sound policies. At the
                        same time, if unfavorable trends of foreign opinion are to be reversed,
                        psychological considerations must be taken into account on a more regular,
                        systematic basis than has been true in the past, not only in the conduct of
                        our information and cultural operations, but at the level of the President,
                        the Secretary of State and all other major officials who make statements,
                        develop policies and decide on action or non-action by the United States
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">No Substitute for Foresight</hi></p>
                    <p>In this connection, no machinery can substitute for a President and Cabinet
                        members who anticipate foreign reactions before they talk or act. However,
                        the Task Force believes that given proper support by the President and his
                        Cabinet the recommendations proposed herein <pb n="22" facs="0059"
                            xml:id="pg_22"/>can insure that psychological considerations are at
                        least not overlooked when policies are being formulated, and that success
                        can be achieved in coordinating the policies and actions of the manifold

                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Failures at the Top</hi></p>
                    <p>Considering the severe limitations to which they have been subjected in
                        recent years, the staffs of the international information, education and
                        cultural arms of the Government have functioned remarkably well. With some
                        exceptions, however, the programs which they have been asked to carry out
                        have become pedestrian and routine. Furthermore, other weaknesses have
                        limited the staff’s effectiveness—deficiencies which must also be rectified
                        if the United States is to regain prestige abroad. By and large, for
                        example, the President, his Cabinet and their staffs have failed to:</p>
                    <p>1) infuse psychological considerations, on a systematic basis, into the
                        formulation and execution of substantive policies which have or could have
                        psychological impact;</p>
                    <p>2) develop clear-cut, meaningful, long-range objectives (world-wide and
                        country-by-country) toward which our international information, education
                        and cultural programs and all the media should be working;</p>
                    <p>3) devise common informational themes to be stressed by all departments and
                        agencies of the government, which would help define as well as achieve
                        America’s psychological objectives;</p>
                    <p>4) determine on a priority basis and with sufficient precision the “target
                        groups” to be emphasized in each country; more specifically to establish, on
                        a sufficiently systematic and extensive basis, close, continuing working
                        relationships with:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>(a) new or emerging elites (e.g., military or urban middle-class), or</p>
                        <p>(b) urban labor and youth (particularly university students) in countries
                            where they will play an increasingly important political role;</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>5) coordinate effectively the various informational and cultural tools
                        available to the United States Government so as to attain long-range
                        objectives in target areas as well as with target groups.</p>

                    <p>It is recommended below that certain exchange of persons, educational and
                        cultural programs now being conducted by other agencies be transferred to
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. In the case of certain other
                        activities, however, such as those of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        and the Department of Defense, such a step is not feasible. The problem is
                        not one of amalgamation but of more effective coordination.</p>

                        administrative responsibilities, requiring specialized personnel unsuited to

                        disruption of current operations would be required which the United States

                    <p>The Committee should have a relatively small, high-level staff whose primary
                        purpose would be to develop ideas and originate material for presentation to

                    <p>Some members of the Task Force thought the functions suggested for the

                        responsibility of the Department of State. About two-thirds of the Task
                        Force, however, favored the recommendation on the grounds that the functions

                        several agencies of the government which are directly concerned; that the

                        which can only be assured structurally through the formation of a board or
                        committee; and that this committee to be effective should be set up at no

                    <p>a) The Exchange of Persons Program (now in the State Department);</p>
                    <p>b) The Cultural Presentations Program (under the President’s Special
                        International Program, now in the State Department);</p>
                    <p>c) The educational, book and English-teaching programs now being conducted by
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> which are not confined to technical
                        assistance training;</p>
                    <p>d) The International Trade Fair Program (now in Commerce).</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Other Views</hi></p>
                    <p>The proposals to transfer the exchange of persons and cultural presentations
                        programs from State to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are proposals
                        on which the Task Force is not unanimous. Some members believe that such
                        programs should be handled by private or semi-public organizations rather
                        than by governmental agencies. Others feel that transferring these programs
                        to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, which they consider a propaganda
                        agency, would contaminate them and lead to their being used for propaganda
                        purposes; that “education” and “culture”, in other words, should be kept
                        separate from “information”. In addition, it should be noted that Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> and many individuals
                        and organizations in the educational community, would probably oppose such
                        transfers, particularly of the exchange of persons program. Nevertheless,
                        the majority of the Task Force feels that such a shift should be made,
                        chiefly on the <pb n="26" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_26"/>ground that it would
                        greatly facilitate the coordinated use of integrally related tools for
                        accomplishing, not short-term propaganda effects, but long-range United
                        States objectives. Opposition to the proposal to transfer the educational,
                        book and English-teaching programs now being conducted by <gloss

                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> records and personnel necessary for a
                        meaningful critique of the specific media programs now conducted in the
                        information field. There has been within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> an almost continual review of the techniques and adequacy
                        of the agency’s use of various media—radio and television, official press
                        services, motion pictures, libraries, etc. The results of these studies will
                        unquestionably be available to your Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> when he is appointed. A useful reappraisal of these
                        programs to determine whether proper emphasis is being placed on the given
                        media and whether additional appropriations are required to expand a
                        particular activity must of necessity proceed on a country by country basis.
                        The Task Force has concluded that this is beyond its capability. However, it
                        does wish to make certain recommendations in terms of new programs which it
                        believes deserve the immediate attention of your Director of <gloss

                        About the United States</p>
                    <p>In many areas of the world newspapers cannot afford the rates charged by the
                        Associated Press and United Press International wire services. As a result,
                        in key areas news media are almost completely dependent on cheaper foreign
                        press services for news about events in the United States. This necessarily
                        results in a more limited amount of coverage and also in foreign peoples
                        consistently being exposed only to foreign interpretations of events in the
                        United States and their significance.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you instruct the Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> to immediately explore possible governmental action to
                        make United States wire services available to newspapers in key foreign
                        countries, if necessary through direct government subsidy, to permit rates
                        competitive with European services.</p>

                    <p>Elsewhere in this Report the Task Force has urged greater recognition of the
                        importance of directing information and cultural activities toward emerging
                        power elites and particularly students and intellectuals who will wield
                        increasing political power in emerging underdeveloped nations. One
                        indispensable means of influencing such groups is by exposing them to the
                        best political, economic, social and scientific thought of the United
                        States. This can be accomplished only by placing in their hands the books
                        and magazines through which such thought is conveyed. Books published in the
                        United States, even the less expensive paperbound editions, are still
                        prohibitively expensive in many critical areas of the world. This is
                        particularly true because they are competing in a market flooded by cheap,
                        subsidized Soviet publications. You should instruct your Director of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to immediately prepare programs for
                        distribution of books and magazines, where necessary in translation, at
                        prices which make them easily available. It appears probable that the most
                        feasible solution again may be direct subsidy of foreign distribution by
                        United States publishers.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Service Officers, early in their career, should be required to have
                        training and experience in international information and cultural programs.
                        Sensitivity to and competence in the psychological aspects of foreign policy
                        must become “built into” our State Department and Foreign Service. Today,
                        the Foreign Service has a definite “blind spot” and prejudice when it comes
                        to the psychological aspects of international affairs—tendencies which,
                        almost by heredity, are being handed down from one generation of Foreign
                        Service Officers to the next. There must be a mutation in this process if
                        the ideal is ever to be achieved: a State Department and Foreign Service
                        capable of taking into account, automatically and instinctively, the
                        psychological considerations necessary for American foreign policy to

                    </list>
                    <p>I would like to put on paper some of the thoughts I have expressed to you
                        orally on the tremendous opportunities which I believe the United States is
                        missing in regard to radio in Africa. These feelings, growing out of my own
                        trip to the area late last spring, have been reinforced by reports from
                        other travelers as well as the comments and evaluation of many expert
                        observers of the African scene.</p>
                    <p>In my opening sentence, I use the term “United States” rather than Voice of
                        America deliberately. Given our mission and facilities, I think that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is perhaps meeting its particular
                        challenge in Africa as well as might be expected. Certainly, increased
                        facilities and more manpower and funds will enable us to expand and refine
                        our operation; as you are well aware, we are energetically pursuing these
                        goals. However, I think the opportunities this country faces in the field of
                        radio go well beyond the capacity or even the function of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. And it is this broader task which I would
                        like to outline briefly.</p>
                    <p>Necessary to a full appreciation of this possibility are a few fundamental
                        facts in regard to mass communication media in Africa (throughout this
                        memorandum my use of Africa is meant to apply to sub-Saharan Africa rather
                        than the entire continent):</p>
                    <p>1. Radio is today, and for the foreseeable future will remain, the closest
                        instrument to a medium of “mass communication” on the continent. In the area
                        involved, radio today reaches a potential audience of 17,000,000 which will
                        probably double within the next five years.</p>
                    <p>2. Neither press, television nor motion picture can hope to reach anything
                        close to this level in the near future. Illiteracy and the limitations on
                        widespread distribution impede the development of press; television is
                        simply too expensive for more than an experimental level <pb n="30"
                            facs="0067" xml:id="pg_30"/>for a long time—and once it gets out of this
                        stage, the lack of power outside the major cities will make it largely an
                        urban medium; motion pictures face limitations of projecting equipment,
                        distribution means and exhibition facilities.</p>
                    <p>3. The emerging independent governments recognize the potential of radio.
                        Almost every new government of any means—and even those without capital—is
                        rapidly expanding both its domestic and external transmitting capability and
                        is encouraging set distribution.</p>
                    <p>4. Expansion of radio on an even more accelerated pace is not only possible
                        but the most economic means available to the new governments to communicate
                        with their peoples. Radio transmitters are comparatively inexpensive; the
                        availability of cheap transistor sets makes distribution feasible even in
                        non-electrical areas; and staff requirements are reasonably modest in
                        comparison with other media.</p>
                    <p>5. The overwhelming shortages faced by the new countries in this “explosion”
                        of radio are trained staff and broadcast materials. The management of these
                        new stations find it particularly hard to develop the type of educational
                        broadcast materials which are in greatest demand by their listeners.</p>
                    <p>In this situation, the United States can play an aggressive, imaginative role
                        of servicing which can bring far-reaching dividends in coming years. What is
                        needed is a major undertaking which will provide servicing to African
                        radio—training of staff, consultative services, non-political broadcast
                        materials, largely in the educational field of both an academic and adult
                        extension nature. Expert consultation can provide the technical means for
                        development of radio in the countries concerned; training of staff can
                        insure orientation of the people who will direct the medium for many years
                        to come; and provision of educational broadcast fare can create a vast
                        reservoir of good will as well as orientation towards the source of such
                        materials on the part of millions of Africans who above all are looking for
                        education of any type.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> and Sorafom would seem to be the natural
                        godparents of such an undertaking in their former colonial possessions. Both
                        are trying to meet the challenge to some extent. But both have the onus of
                        colonial heritage and neither has the capacity nor funds to fill the market.
                        As countries begin to flex their nationalism, they are rejecting even the
                        limited help that <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> and Sorafom can
                        provide.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt a need exists. Every contact we have had indicates that the
                        directors of radio in these countries are going to get their needs met in
                        one way or another. If the United States does not meet the challenge, other
                        countries will. Certainly, both Moscow and Peiping are active in this
                        area—but both fortunately face problems of language and some political
                        resistance in the area. I think the conclusion is <pb n="31" facs="0068"
                            xml:id="pg_31"/>inevitable that the way is pretty much open for the
                        United States if it uses discretion, tact and imagination.</p>
                    <p>I am not speaking of any limited effort. I think <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> could and should play an important, though not a primary,
                        role. But what I think is needed is across-the-board massive undertaking
                        that might well go beyond radio, in fact to other means of mass
                        communication. This offer should perhaps be sponsored by a Foundation in
                        order to eliminate the suspicion of U.S. Government motivation or at least
                        by a separate government organization which would draw on the facilities and
                        resources of such agencies as <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, State
                        and <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>. Red tape, bureaucratic issues of
                        jurisdiction, the normal built-in caution and resistance of the established
                        agencies would have to be overcome. What is needed is boldness,
                        persistence—and money in substantial amounts. But given all this, I think
                        the United States could make an investment which would bring many rewards in
                        terms of national interest in the future.</p>

                    <p>All major British papers lauded the address. The Daily Mail printed it in
                        toto on the front page in place of the normal one-column editorial. The
                        Manchester Guardian called it “an inspiring example of a courageous man
                        dedicating himself to great responsibilities.”</p>
                    <p>In France, Le Figaro said, “The speech was full of virile language . . . The

                    <p>In Germany, West Berlin’s Spandauer Volksblatt said, “Seldom in American
                        history has an American President made such an impressive inaugural
                        speech.”</p>
                    <p>Cairo’s Akhbar Elyom observed, “We should look forward to the future with
                        confidence. However, the U.S. relations with the Arabs has suffered in the
                        past because of the Palestine question.”</p>
                    <p>In India the Hindu of Madras wrote, “Though Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"

                        politician and is determined to be a strong Chief Executive on the model of

                    <p>Lima, Peru’s newspaper El Comercio echoed this: “President <persName

                    <p>In Tokyo, Yomiuri emphasized the President’s pledge of cooperation with Latin
                        America saying, “There is little doubt that it was a warning to Castro’s
                        Cuban regime. It is clear that the Cuban issue will be the first major test
                        facing the new administration.”</p>
                    <p>In Tunis the newspaper Al-Amal said, “President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"

                        information, cultural, and educational fields. This has been altered and

                    <p>Much of the disagreement over organization stems from the lack of
                        understanding of the purpose of these programs. Some believe the programs so
                        differ in purpose that they should not be conducted by the same governmental
                        department. Others see the programs as ends in themselves. I disagree with
                        both views. All these programs exist only to further the achievement of U.S.
                        foreign policy objectives. All of them attempt to do this by creating
                        climates of public opinion abroad that advance the aims of U.S. foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Every serious study with which I am acquainted has first pointed this out and
                        then gone on to recommend that the information, cultural, and educational
                        activities be brought together in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,
                        operating independently but subject to State Department policy control. This

                        however, apply to the cultural program. The argument is currently being made
                        in the name of the educational exchange program that all <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cultural activities be placed in the
                        State Department too so they will not be “sullied” by the information
                        program. This plan, presumably, would transfer the book translation,
                        publication, and distribution programs, binational cultural centers,
                        overseas libraries, and most of the exhibit programs into the State
                        Department. The transfer would be made on the theoretical grounds that
                        “information” and “culture” are totally different programs and that they
                        work better when separated.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that they do. The library, for example, is the heart of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> activities abroad. Using it as a
                        base, the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> abroad is able to establish
                        contacts with newspaper editors, radio commentators, and students and
                        influence them because of this institutional backing and the reservoir of
                        material it gives him to work with. When he tries to influence a student
                        organization in Latin America, he uses neither all “informational” or
                        “cultural” tools. He uses both. He combines exchange grants, books,
                        carefully-placed newspaper material, motion pictures and presentation of
                        materials that are often artistic in nature. If he is an imaginative and
                        successful officer, he is always weaving together informational and cultural
                        elements to get the maximum effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>Finally, such a dismemberment of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would
                        deal it a serious morale defeat just at the wrong time. The appointment of

                    <p>As you are well aware, informational, cultural and educational activities
                        have become a major factor in United States foreign relations. In your State
                        of the Union address you emphasized that these activities must be given even
                        greater importance in the future.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">For the text of

                        ties with older nations, help advance underdeveloped nations, and enable the
                        younger generation to build a positive long run basis for world peace.</p>
                    <p>Everyone who has looked into it, including several recent task forces and
                        consultants, is strongly agreed that this whole area is in serious and
                        urgent need of policy clarification, program coordination and strong
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>A wide variety of related activities have proliferated in a number of Federal
                        agencies. In the absence of any clear policy or direction, and under
                        pressures from many sources, there have been conflicts both of philosophy
                        and of day-to-day operations among these agencies, often to the detriment of
                        our foreign relations.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to solutions, our advisers are generally agreed that
                        responsibility for developing policy and coordinating programs must be
                        focused in one place, even though operations may be shared among
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>There are very divergent opinions, however, as to whether and how these
                        diverse activities should be reorganized. The primary agencies involved
                        (though there are many other peripheral ones) are the United States
                        Information Agency, the International Cooperation Agency, the Bureau of
                        Cultural and Educational Affairs of the Department of State, and the
                        Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>The different advisers tend to propose solutions which emphasize their own
                        primary concerns and experience. Some emphasize primarily the
                        “psychological” or propaganda objective and impact, some the <pb n="37"
                            facs="0074" xml:id="pg_37"/>“development” aspect, and others the
                        long-range cultural and humanistic objectives. Actually, of course, all
                        these are important and a way must be found to give them all a properly
                        balanced emphasis.</p>
                    <p>Having considered the various diagnoses and cures that have been submitted, I
                        have come to the following conclusions which I wish to share with you. (1)
                        Although reorganization and redistribution of activities among various
                        agencies will undoubtedly be necessary, this should not be our most
                        immediate concern. Reorganization plans should be based on sound experience
                        of the next few months.</p>
                    <p>The most pressing need right now is to provide all these agencies with clear,
                        firm and imaginative policy and program direction. Even under present
                        organizational arrangements, I am convinced, a much more forceful and
                        imaginative job can be done, especially with an infusion of able people in
                        key positions.</p>
                    <p>(2) Since all of these activities deeply affect our foreign relations, and
                        since the Secretary of State has clearcut responsibility under existing
                        legislation for providing policy guidance or direction to three of the four
                        primary agencies concerned, I believe that the Department of State is the
                        appropriate place to center policy development and coordination for the
                        executive agencies with respect to these matters.</p>
                    <p>(3) In order that the State Department may be properly staffed and organized
                        to exercise this responsibility vigorously and imaginatively, I propose to
                        appoint a well qualified person as Assistant Secretary for Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs. Through consolidation, we have made available an Assistant
                        Secretaryship for this purpose. I believe that a post at this level is
                        requisite to giving the new position and the subject itself proper prestige
                        and authority. This Assistant Secretary, working closely with the operating
                        agencies concerned, would concentrate his energies on clarifying, developing
                        and communicating policies in this area and insuring that such policies were
                        faithfully expressed in operating programs. In this position he could
                        maintain a balanced perspective of the several major objectives involved and
                        devote himself fully to the central problem of policy development and
                        program coordination which confronts us. This Assistant Secretary would also
                        be concerned with providing guidance and stimulation to colleges,
                        universities and private foundations and organizations that constitute the
                        main “resource base” for the nation’s international activities in these
                        fields.</p>
                    <p>I hope to secure for this position, as you know, <persName corresp="#p_CPH_1"
                            >Philip H. Coombs</persName> of the Ford Foundation who I believe is
                        well qualified by experience, ability and personality to get this job done.
                        If you agree with these proposals, I believe that it would help exceedingly
                        to get things off to a fresh start if you personally would announce the new
                        arrangements. <pb n="38" facs="0075" xml:id="pg_38"/>Enclosed is a draft

                    <p>Before our luncheon today<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">No record of the
                            luncheon meeting has been found.</note> I want to set forth for you my
                        views on the role of cultural activities in the conduct of our foreign
                        relations. I particularly wish to comment on the Secretary of State’s letter
                        to the President of January 30<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> on this subject, a copy of
                        which was sent me by the State Department.</p>
                    <p>Since coming to Washington I have spent a large portion of my time studying
                        this matter, with particular emphasis on organizational structure. I have
                        read, or been briefed upon, various recent studies and have heard from
                        officers with years of experience in this field. I am struck by the virtual
                        unanimity of opinion which supports the general <pb n="39" facs="0076"
                            xml:id="pg_39"/>position of our Deputy Director, <persName
                            corresp="#p_WDM_1">Donald M. Wilson</persName>, as set forth in his
                        Memorandum to the President of January 26, 1961 (copy attached).<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d10fn4">Printed as <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> My
                        views, and theirs, are:</p>
                    <p>1. “Culture” and “information” comprise a false dichotomy, in terms of both
                        semantics and organization. Much if not most of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s “information” effort deals with American culture—motion
                        pictures, press releases, radio and television programs, pamphlets and
                        exhibits on American history, literature and the arts.</p>
                    <p>2. Dissemination of information on American culture through the various media
                        to selected audiences is perhaps our most important technique for
                        influencing the political thinking of foreign opinion leaders.</p>
                    <p>3. It may not be politically possible to transfer the exchange-of-persons and
                        cultural presentations programs from State to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> as recommended by the President’s Task Force and two other
                        studies prepared at his request. But we should not further fragment our
                        overseas psychological operations by transferring the “cultural” portion of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to State (even if we could
                        identify and separate this portion) without suffering the ill consequences
                        cited by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> in his
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Part of the problem appears to be a misunderstanding of how the present
                        machinery works. The exchange and cultural-presentation programs directed
                        from Washington by the State Department are conducted in the field by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> staffs under the direction of the Public
                        Affairs Officer who is in charge of all cultural and informational activity
                        in each country. Cultural Officers report to the Public Affairs Officer who
                        is the principal U.S. cultural officer in the country. The <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> staff reports through State channels to
                        the State Department on matters affecting State-directed programs; on
                        matters affecting <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> programs the staffs
                        report to me through our channels. Both Public Affairs and Cultural Officers
                        are employees of this Agency. Many of our ablest Public Affairs Officers are
                        former Cultural Officers.</p>
                    <p>Almost without exception, our Cultural Officers at recent regional meetings
                        in Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kampala, and Beirut emphatically endorsed the
                        present arrangement in the field. Recommendation No. 3 of the Rome
                        Conference of European Cultural and Educational Exchange Officers states:
                        “(Resolved) that since, in a field cultural program, the so-called
                        informational and cultural media and other cultural activities should not be
                        separated, the operations now in <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        should continue to be in a single operational unit under the direction of a
                        single person who reports to the Chief of Mission.” Similarly, the <pb
                            n="40" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_40"/>Kampala meeting “recognized that the
                        Cultural Affairs Officer should be the focus of an integrated cultural
                        program and vigorously urged that there be no organizational separation of
                        cultural and information activities.”</p>
                    <p>While no formal poll of Ambassadors has been taken, we have every reason to
                        believe they prefer the present integrated cultural-informational operation
                        with one man, the Public Affairs Officer, responsible to the Chief of
                        Mission at each post for these activities.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rusk</persName>’s
                        letter to the President of January 30, I do not understand precisely what he
                        has in mind in the way of realigning functions, although I do agree with his
                        thesis that “this whole area is in serious and urgent need of policy
                        clarification, program coordination and strong direction.”</p>
                    <p>While I believe <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must continue to
                        receive policy guidance from State, I agree with the President’s Task Force,
                        the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information, the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMD_1">Sprague</persName> Committee and the informal view of
                        the Bureau of the Budget that the vitality and effectiveness of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> depend in large measure on its
                        independence of operations. I hope and assume that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD_1">Rusk</persName> intends that the new Assistant
                        Secretary will exercise program direction only over those activities now
                        conducted by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. I welcome the
                        new importance given those activities.</p>
                    <p>The State Department has—and will continue to have—the closest cooperation of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> at both the operational and
                        policy levels. Only with such cooperation will achievement of our common
                        objectives be possible.</p>

                            and William Lederer.</note> has a rather long history which I will be
                        glad to fill you in on at your convenience.</p>
                    <p>About two years ago, the Department of State and this office were approached
                        by a representative of Universal International Pictures relative to the
                        possibility of achieving two objectives: (1) to obtain approval of a script
                        which would make it possible for the Department and this office to request
                        cooperation on the part of a Far Eastern country (preferably Thailand) in
                        connection with the production of the film on location; and (2) to assist
                        Universal International Pictures in obtaining aid from the Department of
                        Defense in connection with a number of items available only from the
                        Department of Defense which were necessary to the production.</p>
                    <p>The first script which was submitted was completely unacceptable to everyone
                        concerned. A meeting was held by representatives of the film company with
                        the Department of State and us regarding changes which might make the script
                        suitable. It was our fear at the time that neither Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EG_1">Englund</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3"
                                ><persName corresp="#p_EG_1">George Englund</persName>, a motion
                            picture director.</note> nor certain other people associated with the
                        production of the film were dealing with the Government in good faith in
                        this matter.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, since I was going to the Far East on other business, the
                        Department of State requested that I include a full discussion of this
                        problem with <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Muhl</persName>, Vice President
                        in Charge of Production of Universal Pictures in Los Angeles, and that I
                        also discuss fully with <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Alexis
                            Johnson</persName>, our Ambassador to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>I had such a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Muhl</persName>
                        and received from him assurance that under no circumstances would his studio
                        favor the production of this film unless the script could be written in a
                        manner which would not be harmful to the overall interests of the United
                        States. He assigned his assistant, Mel Tucker, to insure that this entire
                        production was handled in a responsible manner rather than in the <pb n="42"
                            facs="0079" xml:id="pg_42"/>what appeared to be considered sensational
                        approach which was favored by <persName corresp="#p_EG_1">George
                            Englund</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I then discussed the entire situation with Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> upon my arrival in Bangkok. I also
                        discussed the matter with <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">John
                            Steeves</persName> in Hong Kong since he had at almost that exact time
                        been appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs.
                        The conclusion of our Ambassador in Thailand was in general that there would
                        have to be a script which was satisfactory to us since inevitably the Thai
                        Government would more or less want to be guided by our advice relative to
                        whether or not they should assist in making the film in Thailand. It
                        appeared clear that the Thai Government would not want the film made if it
                        would be detrimental to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests.</p>
                    <p>Various people connected with this production, including <persName
                            corresp="#p_EG_1">George Englund</persName>, have been to Thailand at
                        least twice to discuss the entire project and to “scout locations.”</p>
                    <p>Several representatives of Universal International came back to Washington
                        and met with Ed Kretzmann, several other people in the Department, and me
                        about a year ago at which time they brought what they described as a “step
                        outline” of a proposed new approach to the <hi rend="italic">Ugly
                            American</hi> script. This “step outline” had removed most of the
                        objectionable parts of the original script from the viewpoint of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>, the Foreign Service, the State Department
                        in general, but had substituted a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        “Information Officer” as the “heavy.” There appeared to be an obvious effort
                        on their part to play off the varying special interests of the regular
                        Foreign Service, political appointees, <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>,
                        the State Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and they had
                        apparently decided that if they could mobilize the support of the rest of
                        the forces by removing portions which they considered negative they could
                        get away with the use of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as the
                        “heavy.” There was, however, a fairly good closing of ranks at this point
                        and an insistence on the part of everyone concerned on the Government’s side
                        that such an identification of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must
                        not be used and an alternative proposal was made that the “heavy” be made a
                        vague assistant in the Embassy unidentified as to his specific
                        assignment.</p>
                    <p>After this meeting, the group from Universal International promised that they
                        would submit a completed script consistent with all the suggested changes.
                        Although we have heard from time to time that they were “working on the
                        script,” they have not delivered it to either State or us as yet.</p>
                    <p>I want to emphasize that our relations with Universal International are
                        extremely good as they are with every Hollywood film company. As a matter of
                        fact, this has been the only case that I can recall of where there has been
                        obvious efforts made to pressure various elements of the Government in an
                        apparent desire to create friction within the Government so as to prevent a
                        solid position regarding <hi rend="italic">The Ugly American.</hi></p>
                    <p><pb n="43" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_43"/>It has been my observation, rightly or
                        wrongly, that this effort has been made primarily by <persName
                            corresp="#p_EG_1">George Englund</persName> who has used John Horton (a
                        public relations consultant here in Washington) in an effort to create some
                        confusion on this entire matter. My feeling is that <persName
                            corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Muhl</persName> is anxious to avoid anything that
                        would be openly detrimental to the Government.</p>

                            asked: “Mr. President, Castro is reported to have built a new radio
                            station, one of the largest in the hemisphere, which will begin
                            operations within a few months to broadcast pro-Castro propaganda
                            throughout Latin America. Is there anything we can do or plan to do to
                            counter this?” The President responded: “We are giving the matter of
                            Cuba and its export of its revolution throughout Latin America a matter
                            of high priority. I could not state what actions will be taken yet until

                    <p>Over a dozen powerful short wave transmitters in the U.S. Seven short wave
                        transmitters with a total power of 530 KW are now being used for our hour
                        long Spanish broadcast at 8:00 p.m. each evening. An hour later this program
                        is repeated over two West Coast transmitters with a total power of 200
                        KW.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the short wave broadcasts, the Agency enjoys a tremendous
                        placement on the local radios throughout Latin America. About 140 stations
                        now relay portions of our short wave broadcast. In addition, we place
                        roughly 400 hours a day on some 1,500 local stations in Latin America.</p>

                        ½ hour daily in English. It also has a 7½ KW short wave transmitter which
                        carries the same programs.</p>

                    <p>WRUL has five short wave transmitters in Boston with a total of 220 KW. These

                    <p>Half a dozen commercial U.S. medium wave stations can be heard in some parts
                        of Cuba, particularly late at night. WGBS in Miami has the best coverage.
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is now placing two hours a day of
                        Spanish on WGBS—one hour late in the evening, one hour early in the morning.
                        WGBS broadcasts 50 KW in the daytime but is required to reduce power to 10
                        KW at night. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is attempting to get

                        has not been successful.</p>
                    <p><pb n="45" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_45"/>Last year a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> technical monitor toured the entire island of Cuba and
                        obtained complete and accurate data on both medium wave and short wave
                        reception, city-by-city. He found that in addition to WGBS, the Atlanta,
                        Nashville, and New Orleans stations had fair reception in limited areas,
                        especially late at night.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">FACTS:</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that there are about 1,100,000 radio receivers in Cuba, of
                        which at least 10% can tune short wave. There is considerable evidence that
                        the number of short wave receivers may be significantly larger however—many
                        of them having been smuggled into Cuba during the Batista regime<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d12fn3">Fulgencio Batista served as President of Cuba from 1940
                            until 1944 and from 1952 until he fled Cuba on January 1, 1959.</note>
                        in order to hear Castro’s short wave broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>There are 135 medium wave transmitters on the island. While most are quite
                        low power, at least two are 50 KW. Most of these stations are concentrated
                        in urban areas. Twenty-five <gloss target="#t_FM_1">FM</gloss> transmitters
                        are mainly used for relay purposes. Six low powered short wave transmitters
                        are now in use but a 100 KW transmitter purchased from the Swiss last year
                        should be on the air shortly.</p>
                    <p>The large number of medium wave transmitters, particularly in the Havana
                        area, effectively block reception of medium wave stations from outside the
                        area. Since Cuban radios no longer operate independently, Castro can assign
                        many to a jamming function without interfering with his domestic coverage.
                        For the last six weeks he has been jamming Swan medium wave with increasing
                        effectiveness. He has attempted jamming on short wave but physics is against
                        him and the short wave jamming has been largely ineffective. If Castro
                        chose, he could change the frequency of his most powerful transmitters and
                        interfere with U.S. commercial broadcasts as far north as New York and as
                        far west as the Mississippi.</p>
                    <p>In February, 1960 the Senate ratified the North American Regional
                        Broadcasting Agreement to which Canada, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
                        Mexico, and the West Indies are signatories. The treaty, negotiated over ten
                        years ago,<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">The agreement was signed November 15,
                            1950, in Washington.</note> assigns specific frequencies and powers to
                        the different countries for the express purpose of minimizing interference
                        between countries. If the U.S. Government overtly broadcasts on medium wave
                        to Cuba, it would be a clear violation of this treaty.</p>
                    <p><pb n="46" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_46"/>In view of the above, <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and we have divided the job as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> short wave broadcasts are aimed at an
                        audience throughout Latin America. They discuss problems of interest to all
                        of Latin America, including the Cuban problem. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Cuban position is explained not only to Cubans but to other
                        Latin Americans. Its tone is objective and unexcited. Short wave broadcasts
                        are massively supplemented by placement of material on local radios.</p>
                    <p>Radio Swan is for Cubans to talk to Cubans. Its purpose is to excite its
                        listeners and to ridicule and undermine the regime. The <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> program on WGBS, while also Cuban to
                        Cuban, is designed to be more objective, more certain of its accuracy, and
                        quieter in tone.</p>
                    <p>All evidence points to both <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and Swan
                        having wide audiences. Many listen to both; to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> for confirmation; to Swan for titillation. Some say that
                        Swan has carried too many unfounded rumors and that its credibility is low.
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is well aware of this and is
                        watching it carefully, but we all agree the purpose of Swan is to be
                        exciting. It should not have the same broadcast policy as the Voice. The
                        WGBS program is just starting. All of this can perhaps best be summed up in
                        the following direct quote from a Cuban defector who arrived in Mexico last
                        week:</p>
                    <p>“<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is the only thing we have, now that
                        Radio Swan is being jammed. People spend the whole day waiting for the Voice
                        of America broadcast. They consider it truthful and completely reliable. We
                        know that when the Voice says it, it’s true. It is dangerous to be caught
                        listening to the Voice of America, but everybody is doing it. There are many
                        short wave sets in Cuba because they were popular when Fidel was
                        broadcasting from the Sierra Maestra. Now they are being used to hear the
                        Voice. We also try to hear Miami on the regular broadcast band, but it is
                        not as clear or as strong as hearing the Voice from Washington.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATIONS:</p>
                    <p>The ’62 <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> budget calls for
                        an increase of one hour in Spanish. The B budget you approved would call for
                        an additional hour over that, which would make a total of three hours of
                        daily originations in Spanish. I believe that this would be ample.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has been urged by many to build a medium
                        wave station in Florida. We have done the engineering studies of this. I do
                        not recommend it however since it would be a clear violation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NARBA_1">NARBA</gloss> Treaty; Castro could jam it in all the

                    <p>Many have also urged us to buy time on commercial stations. In fact, the

                        have been completed. The performance within the several categories varies
                        for different reasons, the primary ones being Soviet interest in scientific
                        and technical exchanges, reluctance to engage in long-term exchanges and a
                        desire to avoid informational exchanges.</p>

                        countries and indicates that, except in the case of Poland, exchange
                        activity has been strictly limited because of the unfavorable political
                        climate in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the cautious attitude of Rumania, and
                        the only recent resumption of diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. Modest and
                        gradual increases can be expected with Rumania and Bulgaria, but there is
                        little hope for any significant change in the cases of Hungary and
                        Czechoslovakia. The large-scale Polish program is unique because exchanges
                        have been developed and financed primarily by private American groups,
                        particularly the Ford and <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                            >Rockefeller</persName> Foundations. The opportunities in Poland are
                        still large but these are limited by the attitude of the Polish Government
                        and the available official funds.</p>

                        that exchanges arranged and carried out imaginatively, persistently, and
                        with adequate resources of trained personnel and funds can be responsive to
                        and advance our long-term interests.</p>

                    <p rend="center">REASSESSMENT</p>
                    <p>There is considerable interest abroad in the process of reassessment now
                        under way in Washington. The significance of that process is worth
                        clarifying, for the world has witnessed only two such thoroughgoing changes
                        of U.S. Administration in nearly three decades.</p>
                    <p>The new Administration is conducting a general reassessment of its foreign
                        policies in the light of the awareness that this is an era of great change.
                        The world today is undergoing basic changes of a depth and scope and
                        velocity which make this period a major turning-point in history. The
                        Administration believes the central issue in foreign policy is to associate
                        the United States constructively with an epoch of inevitable change. The
                        U.S., with its friends, must decide on their mutual and realistic
                        aspirations for the future.</p>
                    <p>In many cases the current reassessment will confirm the validity of previous
                        decisions, enabling the Government to continue their application with
                        confidence. In other cases, reassessment will disclose the need for a shift
                        of emphases. In every case the constant of U.S. foreign policy is the
                        aspirations of the American people. Under the democratic system, foreign
                        policy could not long be at variance with those aspirations. Fundamental to
                        all policy, domestic and foreign, are the national <pb n="50" facs="0087"
                            xml:id="pg_50"/>strength and growth adequate to that degree of American
                        leadership in [<hi rend="italic">is</hi>] change itself which circumstances
                        may require.</p>
                    <p>The United States is determined to explore new solutions and, instead of
                        belaboring old problems, to view these in fresh perspective. The U.S. hopes
                        its determination is matched in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>A prime difficulty is the unwillingness of the Soviets to achieve settlements
                        on any terms but their own. Both the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> face major problems beyond their direct control. One such
                        problem is the prospective proliferation of nuclear weapons to even more
                        countries than now possess them. There is some feeling in Washington that
                        the Soviets may incline toward some specific progress in the realm of arms
                        control. But no progress is possible unless they change their views on
                        inspection designed to assure compliance with agreed control measures.</p>
                    <p>Another major problem of interest both to the U.S. and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is the rising power and belligerence of
                        Communist China, a have-not country with a vast and growing population and a
                        historical record of imperialist expansion. Peiping poses a major threat to
                        Southeast Asia, coveting the land and resources of that area. The immediate
                        threat is against Laos, and the United States would react vigorously if
                        Peiping placed military pressure on Laos. In the long run, the problem for
                        the non-Communist world will be to contain Chinese Communist aggressiveness
                        and to seek a way to help reduce Communist China’s internal pressures.</p>
                    <p>There are other problems toward the solution of which new and more effective
                        approaches are needed. These include the urgent and mounting requirements of
                        newly emerging nations for developmental assistance, and the orientation of
                        long-established friendly alliances to fresh and complex challenges. It is
                        on such problems that the current reassessment in Washington is
                        focusing.</p>

                            ‘Themes’</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In the various U.S. government information operations since the end of World
                        War II, numerous efforts have been made to focus media output on priority
                        themes.</p>
                    <p>The most ambitious effort was begun in 1954. Its purpose was to establish a
                        number of “Global Themes” which presumably would dominate output both in
                        Washington and the field. Over a two-year period the following were
                        established as Global Themes:</p>
                    <p>1. Unite the Free World in order to reduce the Communist threat without
                        war.</p>
                    <p>2. Expose the Communist Party or movement as a foreign force directed from
                        Moscow or Peiping for expansionist purposes—Red colonialism.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States champions peace and progress through peaceful
                        change.</p>
                    <p>4. The United States seeks with other nations and peoples to speed
                        development and use of the Atom for Peace—as a promise of better life and a
                        powerful force for world peace.</p>
                    <p>In December 1955 the terminology was changed to “Global Objectives.” This was
                        tacit recognition of the lack of clarity in their formulation and their
                        relative uselessness as guides to output. They remained on the books until
                        July 1959 when they were officially cancelled but they had been virtually
                        forgotten by that date.</p>
                    <p>The present consensus in the Agency is that they largely failed of their
                        purpose for these reasons:</p>
                    <p>The first three themes were too general and platitudinous to be of much use.
                        Theme No. 2 was merely an awkward restatement of one of the Agency’s primary
                        missions. Numbers 1, 3 and 4 were heavily dependent on Government actions
                        and statements for real effectiveness. The Atoms for Peace theme, which <hi
                            rend="italic">was</hi> specific, is cited by some <pb n="52" facs="0089"
                            xml:id="pg_52"/>as the only effective theme because there were specific,
                        easily-related deeds to match the words. Here too, however, when the action
                        program petered out, so did the Agency theme, but only after a brief period
                        during which the words ran so far ahead of the deeds as to raise
                        unrealizable expectations. Finally, there was no follow-up or enforcement in
                        the media to see that the themes were being used. (<gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >IOP</gloss> had no power of enforcement.)</p>
                    <p>In 1956 and 1957, one theme was introduced which did have impact on the media
                        and the field. The “Peoples’ Capitalism” campaign, although not officially
                        promulgated as a theme and despite the widespread objection in many posts to
                        the title, did achieve coordinated output by all the media on the nature of
                        the American economy.</p>
                    <p>In 1959, two relatively modest efforts were initiated. With the advice of the
                        Areas and the Media, <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> worked out two
                        comprehensive lists of themes to be stressed in Washington media output, one
                        for the general field of American life and culture, and the other for the
                        material issued by the Agency on Communism. Both these lists are still
                        technically in effect but evidence of their use by the media is spotty.
                        There is no central evaluation of media output and neither <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> nor anyone else has enforcement authority
                        for such guidances.</p>
                    <p>Two years ago, in the absence of any centrally established themes, <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> began to issue a series of quarterly
                        themes to guide their language services and the writers of centrally
                        produced scripts. More recently, <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>, in an
                        effort to ensure a degree of homogeneity in the political content of Agency
                        programs, began to specify sets of themes on a periodic basis. One of the
                        purposes of such lists is to have media staffs relate upcoming developments
                        in the foreign policy field to a set of priority concepts which the
                        Government and the Agency wish to stress.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s experience thus far with the central selection of themes would
                        suggest the following conclusions:</p>
                    <p>(1) A distinction needs to be made between two types of themes: (a) those
                        major themes which the Agency would like to see the Government project (or
                        which the Government has already decided to project) around the world
                        through a program of action and high-level statements over a period of time
                        and which the Agency would help publicize alongside the commercial media
                        which must do the bulk of the job; and (b) those themes which the Agency can
                        usefully choose to emphasize in its own output with less regard to what the
                        rest of the Government may or may not be doing at the moment.</p>
                    <p>(2) In this connection, distinctions have to be made among the three broad
                        fields of subject matter with which our media generally deal: the field of
                            <hi rend="italic">current U.S. foreign policy</hi> and U.S. governmental
                        action which has major impact abroad; the related field of <hi rend="italic"
                            >communism</hi> and Sino-Soviet Bloc affairs, and the field of <hi
                            rend="italic">American life and culture.</hi></p>
                    <p><pb n="53" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_53"/>(3) Generally speaking, in the field
                        of <hi rend="italic">current U.S. foreign policy</hi> themes can be
                        effective for the Agency only if they have been adopted as themes for the
                        Government as a whole. On such subjects as military strength, disarmament,
                        negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, foreign
                        economic assistance, aid to education abroad, international cooperation in
                        science, cultural interchange, support for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> and rule of law, our attitude to free world alliances and
                        our attitude toward national independence, a decision by the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to concentrate output on this or that
                        related theme would be just as ineffective today as it was in 1954 unless it
                        is accompanied by a <hi rend="italic">sustained</hi> program of national
                        action and of repeated top-level articulation of the relevant purposes and
                        achievements. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can have an important
                        role to play in suggesting such themes and, if they are adopted, advising on
                        the most effective manner and timing of actions and statements useful in
                        projecting the themes. (See <persName corresp="#p_SMD_1">Sprague</persName>
                        Committee paper<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">See <ref target="#d3fn5">footnote
                                5, Document 3</ref>.</note> on Themes.) Selection by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> of themes which it knows will be
                        supported by Government actions and statements, and on which it wants its
                        own media to place special emphasis, would then have real meaning and
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>(4) On the other hand, in the other two major spheres with which <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> output deals, the general projection of
                            <hi rend="italic">American life and culture</hi> and various aspects of
                            <hi rend="italic">Communism</hi>, the Agency has much to gain by
                        independently selecting the priority themes on which its media should
                        concentrate. Hopefully an increasing percentage of our material on American
                        life will report and reflect Government and private action to improve the
                        quality of our society but much of our output will still be concerned with
                        the existing reality of the American scene in which Government action is not
                        necessarily the dominant factor. In the field of Communism, our material is
                        naturally affected by events in the Sino-Soviet Bloc and the Communist
                        movement, but considerable output can still be devoted to fairly permanent
                        characteristics of Communist philosophy and behavior. In both these fields
                        our present output is inclined to wander almost aimlessly over an infinite
                        spectrum of subject matter, sometimes without any clear purpose. Periodic
                        establishment of Agency priority themes in these two fields would result in
                        greater impact abroad. (See Agency Guidances No. 9, June 3, 1959, and No.
                        10, July 14, 1959.)</p>
                    <p>(5) There are a number of central concepts which comprise the basic
                        principles, or at least ideals, of American life and which may also be
                        exemplified in our international behavior. These include such concepts as
                        freedom, openness, progress and change, pluralism, service to humanity,
                        respect for intellectual achievement, and respect for indi<pb n="54"
                            facs="0091" xml:id="pg_54"/>vidual dignity. In regard to such concepts,
                        there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a choice to be made. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can select some of these concepts as
                        themes for the projection of American life by the media regardless of any
                        action we might take in the international sphere. Or the Agency could hold
                        off selecting them as themes until there was a good prospect of Government
                        action to project those themes on a world scale.</p>
                    <p>(6) Selection of themes for emphasis by the Agency should not imply that all
                        other Agency output would be suspended. Providing the posts abroad with
                        material to meet special country and area objectives should not be affected.
                        Nor should all other output be exclusively concentrated on the chosen
                        themes. The value of selecting themes lies in the establishment of <hi
                            rend="italic">priorities</hi> for the ideas on which the media can
                        concentrate and coordinate their world-wide output and which they can treat
                        in depth.</p>

                        Foreign Policy—(Requiring Government wide cooperation)</p>
                    <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> of the United States and the free
                        world is being maintained so that it will effectively deter aggression,
                        prevent the outbreak of war, increase the security of free nations and be
                        able to frustrate limited aggressions without turning them into nuclear
                        cataclysms. We consider this strength a sacred trust, to be handled with
                        prudent restraint.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States is taking the initiative in making constructive,
                        realistic proposals for various measures of <hi rend="italic"
                            >disarmament.</hi> The United States will be tireless in its efforts to
                        find agreement with the Soviet Union on cessation of nuclear tests,
                        prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, prevention of surprise attack
                        and reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons and forces.</p>
                    <p>3. A strong, effective <hi rend="italic">United Nations</hi> and steady
                        progress toward the <hi rend="italic">rule of law</hi> in the world
                        community offer the greatest promise for escape from the precarious balance
                        of terror and from the possibility of a world in the grip of an iron
                        tyranny. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is particularly important
                        today for the security of small nations. (One specific application of this
                        theme now would be to stress: “The best way to keep the cold war out of
                        Africa is to keep the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in.”) The United
                        States will do its utmost to strengthen international institutions which can
                        help keep the peace and create world conditions favorable to the development
                        of all societies in accordance with the desires of their people.</p>
                    <p>4. The United States stands ready seriously to <hi rend="italic"
                            >negotiate</hi> outstanding issues with the Soviet Union. But we will
                        not negotiate out of fear and are determined to defend the principles and
                        positions of freedom.</p>
                    <p>5. We are committed to the encouragement of <hi rend="italic">economic and
                            social development</hi>, progress and growth for all people. Accordingly
                        we favor cooperative international action to solve common economic problems,
                        the freest possible flow of international trade and extensive efforts by all
                        industrially advanced countries to help the newly developing nations help
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p><pb n="56" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_56"/>6. Both the fate of civilization and
                        the satisfaction of individual aspirations everywhere depend on <hi
                            rend="italic">education.</hi> The United States is committed to the
                        expansion of educational opportunities and the improvement of the quality of
                        education both at home and <hi rend="italic">abroad.</hi> Taking seriously
                        the Wellsian dictum that civilization is a race between education and
                        catastrophe, the United States is eager to help the new countries lift
                        dramatically the levels of their peoples’ literacy, technical skill,
                        knowledge and understanding of the world.</p>
                    <p>7. Americans, with their rich and varied inheritance from other peoples,
                        acknowledge and appreciate the achievements and values of other cultures.
                        The United States seeks to encourage a maximum of <hi rend="italic">cultural
                            interchange</hi> among nations both for its own sake and for its
                        contribution to international understanding. The United States is
                        particularly interested in the greatest possible contact with the peoples of
                        the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>8. The community of free nations is being reinvigorated with strengthened
                        defenses, greater attention to mutual consultation and more intensive
                        collaboration on the basis of equality in the political, economic and social
                        spheres.</p>
                    <p>(This theme is primarily of use in Western Europe. It is not popular in the
                        former and present dependent territories in Asia and Africa.)</p>
                    <p>9. The United States supports the independence and self-determination of all
                        peoples, including those in the newly developing parts of the world and
                        those behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>(This theme is primarily of use in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. It is
                        not popular among some of our allies in Western Europe.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Themes on General American
                        Concepts—(Preferably for Governmentwide cooperation but susceptible to
                        effective use by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> alone)</p>
                    <p>1. Basic to American civilization is respect for the <hi rend="italic"
                            >dignity</hi> and rights of the individual. We are striving as a nation
                        to expand and perfect the protection of individual rights at home and we
                        favor the advance of <hi rend="italic">freedom</hi> for all men. We are
                        convinced that nations can achieve industrial development and greater social
                        welfare without resort to tyranny.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States of America today is the spiritual heir of the American
                        Revolution of 1776. We are a people uniquely committed and sympathetic to
                            <hi rend="italic">change</hi>, which has been the keynote of our
                        history. Although we have remained steadfast to the democratic principles on
                        which the nation was founded and have preserved its basic political forms,
                        our laws and institutions have evolved in response to changing needs. We do
                        not cling to the status quo and are eager to help other nations on their
                        road to political, economic and social advancement.</p>
                    <p><pb n="57" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_57"/>3. We are eager to let ideas be argued
                        out freely so that the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> will prevail in all
                        spheres. We are concerned pragmatically with the <hi rend="italic"
                            >realities</hi> both of our own existence and of the world situation. We
                        strive to solve the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> problems which are common to
                            <hi rend="italic">all</hi> societies in the various stages of their
                        development rather than view problems through a prism of outdated dogma and
                        distort solutions to fit a strait-jacket of artificial doctrine. The future
                        belongs to those who respect <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> and deal with <hi
                            rend="italic">reality</hi>.</p>
                    <p>4. The United States, along with other nations, is actively engaged in
                        pushing back the frontiers of science. It is particularly interested in
                        enlisting the achievements of <hi rend="italic">science</hi> and technology
                            <hi rend="italic">in the service of humanity</hi>. It is stepping up its
                        own efforts, and is seeking the cooperation of all other nations, in
                        utilizing scientific advances in combating disease, hunger, poverty and
                        ignorance everywhere.</p>
                    <p>5. One of the main sources of strength of democratic society is its <hi
                            rend="italic">openness</hi>. It helps make possible the fulfillment of
                        individual aspirations and gives free play to the creative energies of the
                        people. Americans are also convinced that nations which insist on
                        concealment of their weapons, forces and aggressive intentions are a menace
                        to peace. The United States will join in challenging the leaders of the
                        Sino-Soviet bloc on this issue and on the additional point that regimes
                        which fear the free movement, thought and voice of their own people are
                        basically weak and lacking in self-confidence. (This concept carries little
                        weight in many parts of Africa and Asia.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">III.</hi> Themes on American Life

                    <p>1. The United States is a pluralistic society in which power is widely
                        dispersed and which functions by achieving compromise among conflicting
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States has evolved a “mixed economy” in which government holds
                        a balance among countervailing forces and interests, acts as a stimulator
                        and regulator of private enterprise, and provides basic social security for
                        its citizens.</p>
                    <p>3. American education is preparing unprecedented numbers of young people for
                        lives that will be satisfying for themselves and fruitful for society. At
                        the same time it is working to improve educational standards, expand
                        resources and increase attention to gifted students.</p>
                    <p>4. The United States, despite great problems, has been making substantial
                        progress through government and community effort toward the integration of
                        its multi-racial population and toward the social and economic advancement
                        of minority groups.</p>

                    <p>1. Communist policies and actions are essentially anti-nationalistic despite
                        vociferous lip-service in support of freedom for colonial peoples.
                        Nationalities have been suppressed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and Communist China. Independent nationalist movements
                        abroad are covertly—and eventually overtly—undermined and opposed. Communist
                        leaders support nationalism only as a “temporary stage on the way to
                        Communism.”</p>
                    <p>2. Communism and freedom of thought and expression are incompatible.
                        Communist societies tolerate only a single approach to the manifold problems
                        of society and the varied creative expressions of the human mind.</p>
                    <p>3. The Communist state disregards the dignity and rights of the individual,
                        interferes with family life and builds up new privileged classes.</p>

                        rather than the economic development aspects of the program. From the
                        propaganda point of view, this will be most effective. It is the people of
                        Latin America we want to reach and to involve in the success of the program;
                        and this we do best by concentrating on the things of direct interest to the

                        strongly the mutual nature of the program, make forcefully the point that
                        the program will not work unless everybody cooperates to make it work, that
                        the U.S. can most effectively help those who are willing to help

                        the Argentine Government reversed its position and began a campaign of
                        opposition to the program. Its motive is peculiar to Argentina, i.e.,
                        defense of the country’s primary exports; and the propaganda appears so far
                        to be local. However, it is intensive and colorful enough to give Communists
                        and others some sharp language to pick up and use throughout the Continent.
                        For example, they are saying that Food for Peace means “fed today, starved
                        tomorrow.”</p>
                    <p>It is true, also, that the wide publicity engendered by the Food for Peace
                        mission does have a tendency to push other aid programs out of mind,
                        fostering the impression among the half-attentive general public that this
                        alone is our current recipe for assistance.</p>
                    <p>Now that the mission has returned, early clarification by an authoritative
                        source, putting the new program into context with the broad spread of
                        development aid, could be useful in Latin America. Perhaps the President’s
                            speech<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">See <ref target="#d17fn4">footnote 4,
                                Document 17</ref>.</note> could touch on this. Consideration might
                        be given to scotching the Argentine slogan in specific terms by pointing out
                        that the aim of our combined programs is “fed today,<note n="4"

                            the Argentine reaction to Food for Peace. However, I don’t think your
                            slogan is quite right. It strikes me as patronizing. I think the
                            President’s speech will help us out on this but maybe we need some
                            direct action in Argentina. Why don’t you think it over again and see if
                            you can come up with a better idea of the approach to this. Please
                            consult with <persName corresp="#p_STC_2">Tom Sorensen</persName> on

                    <p>It is basically important to us that people overseas—enemies, allies and
                        neutrals—think the United States is strong. We should, therefore, do as much
                        as we can to reverse the recent trend of overseas opinion saying the U.S. is
                        weak and to build an image of superior and growing strength. This task will
                        require a long-term effort, since substantial numbers of opinion leaders
                        abroad believe the U.S. is behind.</p>
                    <p>The immediate problem is the tone and tenor of the President’s upcoming
                        report to Congress on the state of our defenses,<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2"
                            >Presumable reference to the President’s March 28 special message to the

                                >Public Papers: Kennedy, 1961</hi>, pp. 229–240.</note> based on the
                        four Task Force studies now being completed. The crucial question, more
                        basic than the “missile gap,” is: Does the defense review show that the U.S.
                        is ahead or behind the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in military
                        strength?</p>
                    <p>We recommend that, no matter what substantive facts the review may reveal, a
                        public posture be adopted which would avoid any implication that overall
                        U.S. military strength is below that of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Assuming the facts warrant it, we would like to see the President and the
                        Department of Defense stress these points:</p>
                    <p>1. The United States has a measurable margin of superiority over the Soviet
                        Union or any other country in overall military strength, including:</p>
                    <p>(a) U.S. primacy by a wide margin in both quantity and quality of nuclear
                        warheads for a variety of offensive and defensive weapons.</p>
                    <p>(b) U.S. overall preponderance in the means of delivery of nuclear warheads,
                        the chief types being planes, missiles, ships and guns.</p>
                    <p>(c) Substantial U.S. lead over all other nations in nuclear-propelled ships,
                        notably the <gloss target="#t_Polaris_1">Polaris</gloss> submarines.</p>

                        serious, require urgent improvement. These deficiencies do not, however,
                        destroy the validity of our claim of primacy. But they should be overcome
                        for two reasons:</p>
                    <p>(a) To make the overall margin of our preponderance even wider and more
                        secure;</p>
                    <p>(b) To ensure that we are not faced with a special military situation, such
                        as a limited war or a request for help from an ally, for which we might not
                        be fully prepared.</p>
                    <p>3. The “missile gap,” in light of our overall superiority, is a matter of
                        limited significance although obviously important. It relates to “means of
                        delivery” in one category only. Our bombers, for example, are available in
                        greater quantities and can carry more and larger warheads.</p>
                    <p>4. Efforts to preserve our military strength have not diverted us from our
                        main goal—the preservation of peace. We must be strong to keep the peace. We
                        look upon our weapons as a sacred trust.</p>

                    <p>The success of the Peace Corps will be closely linked to our objectives. We
                        are eager for it to succeed. We think we can help to see that it does.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Washington Support:</p>
                    <p>A. We have the specialized area and country experience and the media
                        resources to help you in your overseas public relations. Here in Washington
                        we can assist in considering foreign audience reactions to your public
                        announcements. (Even when your press releases, speeches and statements are
                        designed for domestic audiences you may expect them to get overseas.) We
                        would like to work with your staff here to develop materials which we can
                        disseminate abroad through a wide variety of media to make sure that foreign
                        publics correctly understand and support Peace Corps activities.</p>
                    <p>For instance, we would suggest from the world public opinion point of view
                        that the first major Peace Corps activity be a work project in a neutral,
                        underdeveloped country in Africa rather than teaching English on a large
                        scale in the Philippines. This latter idea, while it would have excellent
                        results in U.S. and Filipino eyes, would be looked on in many foreign
                        countries as just another project to reinforce our hold on an ex-colony
                        which is still pretty much in our pocket.</p>
                    <p>B. We have many years experience in recruiting and training personnel for
                        direct contact with foreigners overseas. Particularly relevant to the Peace
                        Corps have been our efforts (1) to improve the screening of recruits through
                        psychiatric examination especially designed to probe for potential strengths
                        and weaknesses in foreign situations; and (2) to train new employees to
                        explain and defend the United States and its history, institutions and
                        culture; to understand the nature of hostile ideologies and to appreciate
                        the nature of the communications <pb n="69" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_69"
                        />process. Rapid training methods in these fields were successfully tested
                        with the guides at the U.S. National Exhibition in Moscow<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d20fn2">The American National Exhibition took place in Sokolniki
                            Park in Moscow during the summer of 1959. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> made an unofficial visit to the Soviet Union July
                            23–August 2, in order to open the Exhibition. During a tour on July 24,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> came to a model American
                            home and stopped in the kitchen. While there, they engaged in an
                            argument about the relative merits of capitalism and Communism. The
                            argument became known as the “kitchen debate.”</note> two years ago.</p>
                    <p>C. We have had more than two decades of experience in teaching foreigners
                        English in more than 70 countries. In the process we have developed
                        specialized techniques and materials which would be of direct value to Peace
                        Corps English teachers.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Field Support:</p>
                    <p>We have offices in all countries in which you will be establishing Peace
                        Corps operations. Each of the U.S. Information Service country
                        establishments is headed by a Public Affairs Officer who is the adviser to
                        the Ambassador’s Country Team on information and cultural matters. As such
                        he and his staff can provide useful psychological guidance in all phases of
                        the development of Peace Corps programs in that country, from exploration of
                        their feasibility and estimating the public reaction to them to working out
                        ways of determining the psychological effects of the programs themselves.
                        The role of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> in helping produce local
                        publicity is obvious. Our people in the field know how to gain access to
                        local media or, as is the case in many underdeveloped countries, can provide
                        their own information outlets such as mobile motion picture projection
                        units. Our people can be of assistance in briefing Peace Corps personnel on
                        local factors important to good reciprocal public relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        Utilization of Peace Corps:</p>
                    <p>I think we agree that the use of Peace Corps personnel in activities directly
                        operated by the U.S. Government should be avoided. They are supposed to be
                        available to help local institutions. However, I believe they could find
                        useful employment in activities of the bi-national centers with which we are
                        associated.</p>
                    <p>Essentially the bi-national center is an indigenous institution devoted to
                        cultural matters, sponsored by a board composed of prominent local citizens
                        and resident Americans, largely self-supporting but assisted by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-provided American grantees who manage
                        and teach in the centers, books, other materials and some cash grants for
                        housing and other expenses. In most of these centers English-teaching is a
                        major activity and the supply of teachers is much less than the demand. We
                            <pb n="70" facs="0107" xml:id="pg_70"/>would hope Peace Corps personnel
                        might be used to help fill this gap. Others might be used to work with
                        university student groups, to help expand use of center libraries, to lead
                        hobby clubs and for other purposes. Since the initiative and responsibility
                        for drawing up plans and operating the programs would be largely in the
                        hands of host country nationals and Peace Corps personnel would be serving
                        local people in a local institution, I believe such activities would meet
                        your criteria. We are looking into the specifics of these possibilities
                        without encouraging local authorities or making commitments.</p>
                    <p>Possibly there are other areas of cooperation which we may find as the Peace
                        Corps develops. We are ready and willing to assist.</p>
                    <p>As an essential element in the day-to-day collaboration between your
                        organization and ours, I propose to nominate a senior member of my staff,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNJ_1">Norman J. Meiklejohn</persName>, as our

                    <p>On Friday, April 14, 1961, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRW_1">Roger
                            Tubby</persName>, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs,
                        telephoned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> at Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName>’s home in Beverly Hills,
                        California and advised him that he had discussed within the Department the
                        situation regarding Universal International Pictures’ effort to produce <hi
                            rend="italic">The Ugly American</hi> in Thailand and that it was the
                        belief of the Department that every appropriate step should be taken to
                        insure that this film was not produced unless and until the script had been
                        changed in order to insure the film would not be harmful to U.S. interests
                        abroad. This decision was based on two important factors: (1) the delicate
                        situation regarding relations in the Far East at the moment; and (2) the
                        fact that there would have to be unquestionably some implied “approval” on
                        the part of the U.S. Gov<pb n="73" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_73"/>ernment
                        involved in connection with the making of this film in a foreign country,
                        especially in view of the fact that cooperation had been requested by
                        Universal International both from the point of view of assistance with the
                        Government of Thailand and assistance by the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> said that since this was
                        the position of the Department he felt confident that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> would concur in this position and
                        that he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName>, would be
                        prepared to discuss the matter fully with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1"
                            >Muhl</persName> if the Department wished him to do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRW_1">Tubby</persName> stated that the Department
                        did wish such a discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> called Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ME_1">Muhl</persName> and made a luncheon appointment for
                        the following day at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ME_1">Muhl</persName> was accompanied to this luncheon by a
                        gentlemen whom he described as one of his “assistants” but who took no part
                        in the discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> pointed out to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Muhl</persName> the historical background of
                        the situation regarding <hi rend="italic">The Ugly American</hi> vis-à-vis
                        the Department of State, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, our Embassy
                        in Bangkok and Universal International. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1"
                            >Shelton</persName> stated that it had appeared approximately a year ago
                        that there had been a meeting of the minds regarding the proper handling of
                        this script, but that now the Government had been faced up again, as it had
                        been before on several occasions, with an unacceptable script and with an
                        expressed urgency on the part of Universal Pictures which seemed to preclude
                        the type of cooperative work to bring about an acceptable script that would
                        be expected under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> said that he wished to
                        make it perfectly clear that nothing he said was in any way critical of Mr.
                        John Horton, the Universal International representative in Washington but
                        that over the past approximately ten years he, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName>, had had occasion to work with
                        studios on perhaps as many as 500 scripts, some just as difficult as <hi
                            rend="italic">The Ugly American</hi> and that he did not believe that
                        the manner in which Universal International had handled the efforts of the
                        Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to cooperate with
                        Universal had made it easier on anyone concerned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Muhl</persName> said he recognized the film
                        was a difficult one but that he wished to reiterate the statement he had
                        made to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> about a year and
                        a half ago that Universal International did not wish to make a motion
                        picture which would be harmful to the United States. He stated, however,
                        that it was his understanding that agreement had been reached on the changes
                        to be made in the script between State Department personnel and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EG_1">Englund</persName>.<note n="2"

                            >Shelton</persName> said that he was of the opinion that these changes
                        were relatively generalized in nature in some cases, and where they were
                        specific they did not strike at the heart of the problem which involved the
                        characterization of the Ambassador and the espousal of the philosophy that
                        the United States uses every effort to force small foreign Governments to
                        accept “the American way” despite their wishes.</p>
                    <p>There followed a general discussion of the story treatment as outlined in the
                        script. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> made the point
                        that he felt there was concern by the Department and <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> that there was not a serious attitude
                        taken by either the producer or the writer toward the basic problems which
                        existed relative to the script and that neither our Embassy or Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TRW_1">Tubby</persName>, who had been in Bangkok, were
                        reassured after discussions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EG_1"
                            >Englund</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName>
                        said that therefore he felt the only alternative was for Mr. <persName

                        to take upon himself the basic responsibility for working out an acceptable
                        script, if possible, and making alternative decisions if necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Muhl</persName> said he would do this and he
                        would assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> that he

                        prevent the production of the film no matter what changes were made. Mr.

                        positive aspects of the Administration’s foreign policy. Positive themes
                        should therefore be emphasized wherever possible. This paper cites examples
                        of positive foreign policy themes immediately available and furnishes a
                        basic inventory to which new themes can be added as they are developed.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Putting our own house in order</hi>. We are tackling the
                        problems of our own society—accelerating our economic growth and setting an
                        example of liberal democracy at work—because what we do at home is the
                        necessary foundation of all genuine effectiveness abroad. The President’s
                        domestic programs illustrate this, notably those concerned with economic
                        growth, minimum wages, unemployment, depressed areas and racial
                            discrimination.<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">The President outlined
                            several initiatives related to housing, unemployment, minimum wage,
                            distressed area redevelopment, disability insurance, and surplus

                            regarding a program for economic recovery and growth. For the text of

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Civility of relations with friend and foe</hi>. In a new
                        effort to influence the emergence of a world environment of peace and
                        orderly politics, we are concentrating on understanding the essential
                        interests of others, and the relationship of these interests to our own.
                        Civility and a patient effort to understand and negotiate differences of
                        viewpoint characterize our diplomacy toward friend and foe alike, in order
                        that we may never be accused of prejudgment or a lack of honest effort.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><pb n="76" facs="0113" xml:id="pg_76"/>We are striking
                            toward a new diplomatic style:</hi> talking less and listening more, and
                        we shall always listen well before we talk firmly. Thus we are consulting

                        of foreign governments and foreign ministers. We are trying to keep our
                        differences with the Soviets and Chinese Communists in low key and are
                        urgently reviewing the nature and extent of these differences in an effort
                        to reduce tensions and ameliorate problems which we have inherited.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Political rather than military solutions</hi>. We have
                        taken steps to show that we are not “trigger-happy” or “bomb rattlers”. We
                        have exercised patience and restraint in Laos, Cuba and the Congo, for
                        example, though the world knows that we possess the military strength to
                        intervene unilaterally. Another example: The President has requested our
                        military to mute their claims about American arms and their estimates of
                        enemy intentions and strength; a conscious effort is being made to tailor
                        Pentagon statements to the new White House specifications for diplomacy.</p>

                            flexibility of military response</hi>. World realities demand that we
                        maintain military strength and the invulnerability of our deterrent power
                        (step-up in <gloss target="#t_Polaris_1">Polaris</gloss> and Minuteman
                        production; emphasis on hardening and shelter concept). But we are no longer
                        committed to a rigid doctrine of “massive retaliation”; instead “any
                        potential aggressor . . . must know that our response will be suitable,
                        selective, swift and effective.” (President’s Defense Budget message<note

                        respects—in order that we may be the better able to negotiate and to defend
                        essential interests during prolonged negotiations—, the President has
                        recommitted us to serious and patient efforts to effect a suspension of
                        nuclear testing and an amelioration of the present arms race under viable,
                        secure and verifiable safeguards. This effort, which we regard as both

                            and since an arms race adds to tension, our present task is the far more
                            difficult one of finding measures which will safely permit reductions in
                            arms while a world of law and order is coming into being. This is why
                            effective inspection and control are required, why progressive steps
                            appear to be a prudent procedure, why the constitutional structure for
                            settling disputes must be strengthened, and why effective international

                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> recommitted our national
                        purpose to the verities of our own revolution and to the fulfillment of
                        these verities within our domestic society and in our conduct of foreign
                        relations. Because we profoundly believe in the truths and purposes of the
                        American revolution, we shall, while eschewing any pretentions to cultural
                        “imperialism”, continue to hold out a helping and protective hand to all
                        people whose purposes coincide with our own. By word and action we will
                        continue to show that we do not stand for the <hi rend="italic">status
                            quo</hi>, that we recognize the nature of the revolutionary changes at
                        work throughout the world, and that we are capable of developing new
                        diplomatic and economic tools with which we can more constructively
                        influence the forces at work.</p>
                    <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Diversity within a world of freedom</hi>. The
                        President, on the basis of our own revolution, has recommitted us to the
                        survival and success of both personal and national liberty. Thus our concept
                        of a Free World of orderly polities admits of diversities from our own way
                        of life and system of institutions. For example, we are giving aid to many
                        governments committed to forms of neutralism in foreign policy, or state
                        socialism or mixed economies at home—e.g., centrally prepared and directed
                        development plans, or public-owned enterprises.</p>
                    <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Understanding of neutralism</hi>. We no longer condemn
                        nations which wish to remain non-committed in the world struggle. Though we
                        can never ourselves again return to our former isolationism and
                        disentanglement from the world’s other continents, and we naturally
                        recognize and cherish the special ties that link some nations with us, we
                        can understand that non-alignment may serve the national interests of some
                        new nations better than does a policy of military alliance or active
                        participation in the Cold War. We recognize in any case that the most
                        constructive contributions to human progress which many developing nations
                        can make is to build the strength to protect their own genuine national
                        independence. Toward nations so situated and motivated, our relationship
                        will be one of cooperation and sympathetic understanding.</p>

                        prepare for the inevitability of independence. Our encouragement of colonial
                        “liberation” in the world’s remaining colonial areas will generally proceed
                        therefore in consultation with the metropoles involved; our effort will be
                        one of helping metropole and colony alike to achieve as rational and orderly

                        need for close cooperation with other departments and agencies of Government
                        and underscoring that statements and actions by Cabinet officers can often
                        have profound impact on world opinion either positively or negatively for
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>These briefings were always well received, and in one instance the President
                        directed that the presentation be brought to the second echelon of
                        management in the various Cabinet agencies.</p>

                    <p>Invariably these presentations caused discussion at their conclusion. From
                        the questions asked it was often clear how little the Cabinet officers knew
                        about the overseas information program and what could (and could not) be
                        expected of it.</p>

                            to which a Theme is effective only insofar as it engages a real need and
                            a real will to work; otherwise it is likely to be (and to be readily
                            identifiable as) mere window-dressing behind which lurk the realities of
                            the diverse and often conflicting interests which nations and peoples

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJB_1">Phillips</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_IAE_1">IAE</gloss>, apologizing if he should seem somewhat

                            corresp="#p_PJB_1">Phillips</persName> said another Berlin crisis was
                        expected between May and September. He recalled the very good media

                            during which he asserted that the parties to the Potsdam Agreement give
                            up the occupation regime in Berlin.</note> when journalists were flown
                        into Berlin and <gloss target="#t_IBS_1">IBS</gloss> gave excellent
                        coverage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJB_1">Phillips</persName> recommended
                        immediate gathering of usable material, including a documentary film
                        suitable both for film programs and for <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>
                        use, to be forwarded to the posts and held by them for use when the crisis
                        breaks.</p>
                    <p>He also offered as a major theme: “<hi rend="italic">Responding to the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">King</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IAN_1"
                            >IAN</gloss>, proposed as a major theme an excerpt from the Inaugural
                        Address: “<hi rend="italic">The United States will pay any price, bear any
                            burden, meet any hardship, support any friends, oppose any foe to assure

                            target="#t_IAL_1">IAL</gloss>, questioned whether we weren’t putting the
                        cart before the horse. He said that it appeared to him advisable, in order
                        to arrive at the desired major themes, first to identify U.S. policy goals
                        worldwide, define potential <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        contributions to their achievement—in light of problems <gloss

                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> assets with the enemy’s assets, and only
                        then attempt to answer the question, “What themes?” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_STC_2">Sorensen</persName> remarked that such was the
                        procedure being followed.</p>
                    <p><pb n="86" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_86"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJP_1"
                            >McKnight</persName> mentioned some of the problems which, in his view,
                        confronted <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>1. “Wave of future” versus “paper tiger”.</p>
                        <p>2. Double standard of morality applied to U.S. and U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>3. “Knee-jerk” pro-Soviet reaction of “intellectual,” “liberals.” (What’s
                            explanation of anomaly?)</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet orchestration of propaganda, diplomacy, military pressure
                            (guerrilla), economic pressures, subversion.</p>
                        <p>5. Soviet “capture” of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> words.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NEJ_1">Nickel</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IAF_1"
                            >IAF</gloss>, suggested that the Agency might undertake the major job of
                        mounting a mass education campaign on “What is economic development?” This
                        might be stated thematically as “<hi rend="italic">Development for
                            Freedom</hi>”, or “<hi rend="italic">Development for
                            Progress</hi>.”<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">An unknown hand placed two
                            parallel vertical lines in the right-hand margin next to this
                            sentence.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NEJ_1">Nickel</persName>
                        suggested that some University might be chosen to do the basic research job
                        and provide a body of doctrine and raw material which the Agency might draw
                        on in the proposed campaign.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hutchison, <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss>, said that the themes he
                        would propose were designed to awaken friends and neutrals to the danger to
                        all and to win the confidence of these friends and neutrals for the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>His themes were: “<hi rend="italic">Forward-changing America versus static
                            communism</hi>;” “<hi rend="italic">Collective security means collective
                            freedom.</hi>”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJR_1">O’Brien</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IBS_1"
                            >IBS</gloss>, said that his theme was broad and blunt, namely: “<hi
                            rend="italic">The United States leads and supports social revolution
                            around the world.</hi>”</p>
                    <p>This might appear tricky and perhaps unpalatable at home and in Europe, but,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OJR_1">O’Brien</persName> noted, a recent bold
                        projection of American revolutionary ideals had been effective around the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLA_1">Squires</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IAA_1"
                            >IAA</gloss>, asked whether the themes to be selected would be <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> themes or U.S. themes—that is, themes
                        built on U.S. policies and actions. He was doubtful of the advisability of
                        working with the former, and felt that U.S. themes should be employed. He
                        foresaw difficulties. In Morocco, he recalled, when the Posts were asked to
                        exploit the Hungarian revolution, the Moroccans were not interested in the
                        plight of the Hungarian refugees and asked, “Why aren’t you doing something
                        about the Algerian refugees?”<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5"><persName
                                corresp="#p_SLA_1">Squires</persName> had served as a Public Affairs
                            Officer in the U.S. Embassy in Morocco during the 1950s.</note> He noted
                        also (someone had mentioned “The Open Society” as a possible theme) that the
                        Africans are not interested in an “open” society; they want a “closed”
                        society. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLA_1">Squires</persName> said that he
                        believed the best opportunities for <pb n="87" facs="0124" xml:id="pg_87"
                        />coordinated media output to get results arise when major U.S. policies and
                        actions come together, as in the Lebanese landings of 1958.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d26fn6">See <ref target="#d3fn6">footnote 6, Document

                    <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLA_1">Squires</persName> submitted an <gloss
                            target="#t_IAA_1">IAA</gloss> paper proposing the theme: “<hi
                            rend="italic">Improving the Image of International and Regional
                            Organizations in the Context of the Indispensability of International
                            Cooperation</hi>.” He suggested emphasis on the idea that “this will
                        win.”)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SO_1">Stephens</persName>, IRI, suggested two
                        themes: “<hi rend="italic">America’s is the true revolution</hi>; <hi
                            rend="italic">Russia’s is counter-revolution</hi>.” “<hi rend="italic">A
                            nation has the right to choose provided it respects the rights of
                            others</hi>.” He indicated that he would give decided priority to the
                        first of the two.</p>
                    <p>(“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SO_1">Stephens</persName> suggested consideration
                        of naming a three-man task force to develop a priority list of themes. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> responded that the themes
                        would be chosen by “a one-man task force.”)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWJ_1">Handley</persName>, <gloss target="#t_ICS_1"
                            >ICS</gloss>, proposed as a theme: “<hi rend="italic">History is on the
                            side of freedom</hi>.” He said that carrying this concept to all the
                        world—a world weary and beset by doubts—could restore hope where there is
                        none and spark courage to halt the advance of communism. It could serve, he
                        said, as a kind of “non-military” penetration of wavering and doubtful
                        countries. He noted that effective subsidiary themes would derive from the
                        first: One showing the United States as “a cornucopia of devices and
                        experience” of immense help to other nations; the other exposing Communism’s
                        practice of wielding power “without a sense of responsibility to God or
                        fellow men.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJM_1">Begg</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IOC_1"
                            >IOC</gloss>, said that a recent conference he had attended, concerned
                        with such matters as “home rule” and “local autonomy of communities” lead
                        him to believe that an effective theme could be based on those concepts. He
                        proposed as his first theme: “<hi rend="italic">American Respect for the
                            Dignity of the Individual</hi>.”</p>
                    <p>(He submitted a paper proposing these additional themes: “<hi rend="italic"
                            >Americans Govern Themselves</hi>;” “<hi rend="italic">The Strengths of
                            the American Democratic System</hi>,” “<hi rend="italic">The U.S. Stands
                            for Rule of Law</hi>;” and, “<hi rend="italic">American Application
                            Abroad of the Free Enterprise System</hi>.”)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IMS_1"
                            >IMS</gloss>, said that, in his view, one of the major problems facing
                        the Agency is that communism is simple and easy to sell, whereas democracy
                        is complicated and pretty hard to sell. He noted that few people seem to
                        realize that the Soviet Union is a fascist state and gets away with passing
                        off its “fascist” achievements as proofs of the effectiveness of communism.
                        The object of the theme he would propose, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1"
                            >Shelton</persName> said, was to break down the appeal of communism and
                            <pb n="88" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_88"/>induce people to reject
                        communism’s “easy road to breakdown and degradation.” The theme: “<hi
                            rend="italic">Expanding and Perfecting Man’s Freedom</hi>.”</p>
                    <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STB_1">Shelton</persName> submitted a paper giving
                        the rationale of this and additional themes. The others: “<hi rend="italic"
                            >Progress and Social Justice through Peaceful Change</hi>;” “<hi

                            >ITV</gloss>, remarked that the theme he was proposing was perhaps “more
                        doctrine than theme,” but that he felt it offered a worthy suggestion for
                        coordinated Media effort. The theme: “<hi rend="italic">Humanism</hi>.” This
                        theme held “the essence of our evolution as a nation.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> remarked that he had long
                        felt that there was “a goldmine in <gloss target="#t_HEW_1"
                        >HEW</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">King</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IAN_1"
                            >IAN</gloss>, questioned whether the humanism theme might not contain a
                        possible booby-trap—that of reviving charges of “U.S. materialism.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJP_1">McKnight</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_IAL_1">IAL</gloss>, asked, “After the loss of Laos and Cuba,
                        would emphasis on Humanism make us seem weak? And would a campaign on
                        humanism perhaps be betrayed by a tough military act?”</p>
                    <p>In a general discussion at this point, it was agreed that the Peace Corps was
                        a self-evident theme, but that no coordinated output should be attempted on
                        it until there were enough Peace Corps projects in actual operation abroad
                        to assure continuing material for the Media to work with—that it would be
                        premature to publicize the Peace Corps very much in the immediate
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BED_1">Brooke</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >IOP</gloss>, noted that considerable work had been done in <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> in developing possible themes and in
                        preparing very comprehensive guidances for media utilization. Two of a
                        number of examples which were available for examination were: “<hi
                            rend="italic">The Scientific Revolution</hi>,” designed to show the
                        depth and breadth of U.S. scientific achievement, and the extent to which
                        this achievement is benefiting the entire world; and, “<hi rend="italic">The
                            Open Society</hi>,” designed to appeal to man’s inherent desire for
                        freedom and to stress communist determination to deny that desire and
                        thereby put the communist powers on the defensive. Noting the able job which
                        enemy propagandists have done in branding America as “imperialist” and in
                        attaching to the U.S. such labels as “Uncle Shylock,” “Wolves of Wall
                        Street,” the “Yankee Dollar,” and “Dollar Diplomacy,” he suggested
                        consideration of a long-term campaign to make the dollar respected again—as
                        a symbol of the hard work of the American people helping to do the important
                        work of the world.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJB_1">Phillips</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_IAE_1">IAE</gloss>, remarked in connection with the “Science”
                        theme that in Western Germany, despite <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> efforts, most Germans <pb n="89" facs="0126"
                            xml:id="pg_89"/>believed that the Russians were ahead of the U.S. in
                        scientific accomplishments. He felt this might be explained by the somewhat
                        “scattered” attention which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has so
                        far given to science.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> said that he hoped all
                        present would not be forgetful of the value of repetition in getting across
                        whatever messages or points the Agency was aiming at its audiences.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> then made an appeal “for
                        small things,” for colorful, revealing items on “what this Agency is and
                        what it does.” Such items could be very useful in speeches and for other
                        purposes. They could be sent to him, via Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PCR_1"
                            >Payne</persName>, on 3 x 5 cards. He said not to make it a chore, not
                        to submit “long reports.” (These should be items such as a letter from
                        Africa on the long waiting list for “The Federalist Papers,” the hunger for
                        education in the Sudan where schools are on three shifts, and the fact that
                        over 200 million people saw <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> films
                        last week.)</p>

                        Peace Corps project (assistance to Tanganyika in road development and
                        geological surveying) at his April 22 news conference.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d27fn3">The news conference took place on April 21. For the

                            the development of roads to open up the country, and I am delighted that
                            some Americans have volunteered to help in this important effort.”

                        foreseeable public-opinion contingencies and opportunities, and that

                    <p>The Peace Corps concept is in keeping with President <persName

                        Address, “to those people in the huts and villages of half the globe

                    <p>“We pledge ourselves to help them help themselves, for whatever period is

                        outlines the motivations and purposes of the Peace Corps. It embodies as

                        publicity about the Peace Corps should be determined within the framework of
                        the Country Team. As a general rule, local publicity should be limited and
                        essentially factual until the Peace Corps itself is firmly established
                            legisla<pb n="91" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_91"/>tively and operationally,
                        i.e. until pilot projects are successfully under way and a reservoir of
                        volunteers has been formed. Publicity should make clear, along the lines of
                        the referenced <gloss target="#t_PotomacCable_1">Potomac Cable</gloss>, the
                        underlying philosophy and general terms of reference of the Peace Corps
                        concept, taking care not to generate unwarranted expectations. This is an
                        informational task, not a sales task.</p>
                    <p>In countries where Peace Corps projects are established, local publicity
                        efforts should be based on Country Team agreement. Posts should file stories

                        by the Federal Government. These contracts, of varying duration, amount in
                        the aggregate to $101 million, almost all of which is borne by <gloss

                        as advisers to the foreign university or to the Ministry of Education and

                    <p>It is with mingled pleasure and awe that I join you today . . . pleasure at
                        being again among so many of my former colleagues . . . awe that I am now
                        the object of those scowling, critical visages among whose array I once sat
                        with my own frowning brow. The frowning brow has not changed. We have only
                        changed seats, and I must now answer questions instead of propounding
                        them.</p>
                    <p>I come to this microphone to tell you of the U.S. Information Agency. In a
                        sense, it is a reciprocal visit. There are members of this club who have
                        shared our international microphones on the Voice of America. For example,
                        three of your members—William Stringer, Ernest K. Lindley, and Fred
                        Collins—do a weekly broadcast for the Voice, entitled “Issues in the News.”
                        The program has had an excellent response from a widely appreciative
                        audience. I trust I shall do these <pb n="97" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_97"
                        />gentlemen no offense, however, if I share with you one letter we received
                        that was not so enthusiastic. “Dear Voice of America,” the letter said,
                        “Never in my life have I heard three more indecisive talkers. They never
                        have anything definite to say. Keep them off the air and run <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F. Kennedy</persName> instead.” Let me add,
                        though, that if I have as few detractors as they, I shall count myself among
                        the fortunate.</p>
                    <p>I have been in my job as Director of the Agency scant weeks. Operating as we
                        do in 98 countries around the world, there is much about the Agency that I
                        have yet to learn. But as a former working newsman like most of you here
                        today, there are a number of thoughts and impressions that I would share
                        with you in my present role as a government official.</p>
                    <p>Our Agency operates in a difficult, not too well defined area. We embrace a
                        multitude of disciplines and professions. Many of you are newsmen who devote
                        your careers, as I did for 25 years, to expression in a single medium of
                        communication. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employs not one but
                        seven: radio, television, movies, press, book publishing, exhibits and the
                        arts. We are involved in an entire range of problems: from a press run in
                        Beirut, an exhibition in Turin, a stage performance in Munich and radio
                        relays in Colombo. From a news telecast in Bogota to a sound-tracked film
                        strip in Paris to a book typeset in Manila—upon all the myriad of details we
                        initiate, we create, we facilitate.</p>
                    <p>Even more important we must deal amidst the intangibles: the difficult,
                        delicate human art of persuasion. For by word of mouth, by cultivated
                        personal contact abroad, we seek to persuade others of the rightness of our
                        view and that our actions and our goals are in harmony with theirs. And this
                        brings on a thought: in the course of a single working day how many of you
                        gentlemen here could exercise your expertise competently over an array of
                        problems as diverse as these?</p>
                    <p>To those bold enough to reply in the affirmative, I offer a note of caution:
                        this is only half the Agency’s problem. For we deal not only in
                        communications but also in policy. We articulate and distribute not
                        advertising for cigarettes and soap suds but clarifications of government
                        policy and deeds. And we speak in many languages to many peoples of vastly
                        differing cultures and styles, of vastly differing levels of comprehension.
                        We must deal also with the very considerable pre-conditioning foreigners

                        realities of their fears, their concerns, their stereotypes—however
                        unjustified, their existence is real—of the product we promote: the actions

                        must be a creature who combines the talents of professional proficiency with

                        communication as most of you gentlemen know about your one. I shall not <pb

                        earn.</p>
                    <p>In my first four months, I have asked many of my colleagues to postpone
                        fellowships, assignments abroad and desirable posts long anticipated. Often
                        at great personal inconvenience, their invariable response to me has been:
                        “Whatever you think is best for the Agency, I will gladly do.”</p>
                    <p>So it was that one of my own long-held illusions about government was rudely
                        shattered on that January day when I assumed office. I arrived at 1776
                        Pennsylvania Avenue expecting a bureaucracy of dawdlers; instead I found a
                        bounty of capable doers. For my own part, I have never worked harder in my
                        life. I have never been called a loafing man—though on occasion I confess a
                        predilection for good conversation, fine wine and rich food—but not since
                        the days of World War II have I worked with such frantic fascination.</p>
                    <p>I am finding that this is truly the time of the “New Zeal”, and it is not
                        easy to set the pace for my younger colleagues. Our work product would
                        stagger the mind of what we in government call “private enterprise”. Our
                        radio broadcasts live over 88 hours a day in 35 languages. Our special
                        wireless file puts out up to 8–10,000 words a day to each of five world
                        areas. Our films reach an estimated weekly audience of about 150 million
                        people. When a special project goes through on a <pb n="99" facs="0136"
                            xml:id="pg_99"/>crash basis, we can get to an audience of over five
                        hundred million. And in television, our “market” is rapidly expanding—some
                        36 million <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> sets and 160 million
                        viewers.</p>
                    <p>Nor is our product dissipated meaninglessly. For the 50 million books we have
                        published in 50 languages, there is incessant demand. In Blantyre,
                        Nyasaland, a library opened in March of this year, and borrowers stripped
                        its shelves nearly bare in about a month of operation. In another African
                        post there was a greater demand for the Federalist Papers in four weeks time
                        than the New York Public Library had in a year. And the first English
                        classes formed in two newly-independent countries numbered among their
                        pupils both Prime Ministers, a number of Cabinet officials as well as other
                        high government leaders and their wives.</p>

                        what the U.S. Information Agency does. We have received letters with ominous
                        overtones, such as a request to “send me all your information on
                        counterfeiting” and “please rush me all the facts on bullet wounds, fast.”
                        Letter-writers have asked us “what percentage of young people are juveniles,
                        how can I figure out which <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> newscasters

                        do-it-yourself fans have written our Agency for information on how to bottle
                        peanut butter, refinish driftwood, operate bongo drums, and make low-calorie

                        palatable.</p>
                    <p>We shall endeavor to reflect with fidelity to our allies, to the uncommitted
                        nations, as well as to those who are hostile to us, not only our policy but
                        our ideals. Yet, in our day-to-day efforts directed to this end, we do not
                        stand alone. For much that is known and believed about this country is
                        beyond the purview of our Agency alone.</p>
                    <p>Just as the work of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is far more than
                        just Voice of America broadcasts, so is the real voice of America far more
                        than just our Agency. From Norway to Nyasaland, from Rio to Rangoon, the
                        story and the face of America goes out in movies, television, magazines and
                        the press. The military, with fighters and their families, number one
                        million abroad. Over four million American tourists travel abroad each <pb
                            n="100" facs="0137" xml:id="pg_100"/>year. Another half million
                        Americans live overseas for reasons embracing both business and pleasure.
                        Foundations, educational exchanges, and international scholarships send our
                        young intellectuals and their studious professors swarming to foreign
                        universities. Fifty thousand foreign students and hundreds of thousands of
                        foreign tourists visit our country every year to hear and evaluate the
                        first-hand voice of America.</p>
                    <p>And all of this has great impact. Italy has built its first drive-in movie.
                        An authentic drug store stands in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe.
                        England, heaven bless its warm draught lager, is beginning to drink cold
                        beer in cans. American blue jeans and slacks vie with the kimono in Japan.
                        Nairobi has its parking meters; there are skyscrapers in Johannesburg and
                        supermarkets in Leopoldville. Air conditioning has settled in Santiago, and
                        even Moscow has succumbed not only to jazz and <persName corresp="#p_AL_1"
                            >Louis Armstrong</persName> but also—heaven assuage the souls of Marx
                        and Lenin—to American installment buying. And these are but frothy facets of
                        the spreading style of America—or of the 20th Century, since both in so many
                        ways are synonymous.</p>
                    <p>Beneath them, and of far more lasting impact, is the broadening outward flow
                        of ideas and techniques of how to live and work together, of respect for
                        neighbors, of faith that every human problem is capable of human solution.
                        We and all the other voices of America that reach outside our frontiers are
                        helping to spread the concept of “access”, of individual self-fulfilment and
                        citizen participation.</p>
                    <p>I tell you all this not to defend our culture but to define our Agency. You
                        gentlemen of the press share very much with our Agency the making of the
                        picture of America that is known abroad. To give you but random figures: 89%
                        of the people in West Germany consider the press as their major source of
                        information about the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>. 77% in Burma,
                        81% in Britain and Japan, 85% in Peru and Uruguay. All of these are people,
                        gentlemen, saying the press is their major source of information about
                        America.</p>
                    <p>And the impact made on these people through the press is of course largely
                        beyond the exclusive influence of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.
                        Yet the picture is even broader. Not only the press, but the television, the
                        movies, the travelling tourists, the missionaries and the businessmen, are
                        part of the chorus that is the real voice of America. It means there are no
                        more domestic issues. The speech of a single Senator to a hometown audience
                        can have more impact abroad than months of our Agency’s informational
                        activities. A breakthrough in science or medicine, the price on the big

                        America—these events and issues are absorbed, debated and pondered on all
                        shores of every ocean.</p>
                    <p>To some of us the picture of a burning bus in Alabama<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d32fn7">In May 1961, civil rights activists led by <gloss

                            Washington on Greyhound and Trailways buses in order to ride through the
                            southern United States to test an earlier Supreme Court ruling banning
                            racial discrimination in interstate travel. In Anniston, Alabama, Klu
                            Klux Klansmen attacked one of Greyhound buses, forced it outside of
                            town, and firebombed it. The KKK members also physically attacked the
                            Freedom Riders. Riders on the Trailways bus were also attacked once the
                            bus reached Anniston and again when the bus reached Birmingham. On June
                            1, the Department of State released the text of a May 29 letter from

                            divorced from our ability to achieve those same purposes for all the
                            people in our own country. The principles of racial equality and
                            non-discrimination are imperatives of the American society with its many
                            racial strains. In the degree to which we ourselves practice those
                            principles our voice will carry conviction in seeking national goals in

                        tomorrow all the way from Manila to Rabat. Here in Washington itself, for
                        example, there exists a much unreported encumbrance on our African relations
                        that can lose us as much influence as anything the Soviets might do. Where
                        do we house African diplomats in our capital? These are representatives of
                        Negro nations led by Negro leaders. It is bad enough that they read
                        headlines of Birmingham bus burnings and beatings. It is even worse that
                        they find it near impossible to live in the capital of our nation. Landlords
                        will not rent to them; schools refuse their children; stores will not let
                        them try on clothes; beaches bar their families. Today there are some 30
                        African representatives in Washington with what is euphemistically called
                        “unsatisfactory housing.” Fully 1/3 of these are termed emergency cases.
                        There will be some 50 more families arriving in the next six months, 100 in
                        the next year. It is not only that these people are humans like the rest of
                        us, but that they are leaders of nations whose friendship this land deems
                        vital. We would have them join our company of honorable men in defending
                        against encroachment our dedication to dignity and freedom. But it is a
                        dignity to which we will not fully admit them.</p>

                        the United States. And if and when that day should come, do not fly to your
                        Information Agency crying that we have not told “our story” abroad. For in
                        this damaging indignity there is blame enough for us all. And let us
                        remember, this is not something the Communists did to us. We do it ourselves
                        in our own capital. Is it possible that we concern ourselves too much with
                        outer space and far places, and too little with inner space and near
                        places?</p>
                    <p>Let me turn back to the subject at hand. You did not invite me here to talk
                        about our duty and our opportunity as citizens, rather to tell you about our
                        work. Quite reasonably, you wish to know where we hope to go and how we
                        shall try to get there. At the outset let me emphasize that I did not bring
                        to the Agency the infinite wisdom of an outsider, with magic cures for all
                        that’s wrong.</p>
                    <p>In fact, much of what I have found is good, effective, solid. I recognize, as
                        I know you will too, that the role of our Agency has limits. We are but one
                        arm of the U.S. government. As such, we must respond to the policy of that
                        government. To put it more bluntly, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        can be no better than the policies it supports and explains. Yet within that
                        limitation there are obviously practices and principles to which we are
                        committed. It is fundamental that we operate on a basis of truth. Ours is,
                        and must be, a dedication to the factual.</p>
                    <p>But this itself poses difficulties. We operate abroad; our audience is
                        foreign. And in this world there are no absolute standards of truth. What is
                        one man’s truth is another man’s falsehood. Our objective is, and must be,
                        credibility. It is easy to assume that because we tell the truth as we see
                        it, others will believe us. But statements that are true are not always
                        believed. It is a measure of our difficulty that in this relentless
                        half-war, truth and credibility are not co-equal.</p>
                    <p>Candor and openness have their merits . . . as the successful <persName

                        their demerits . . . as the abortive Cuban episode demonstrated.</p>
                    <p>On Cuba, we had no choice but to be truthful and complete. At noon on April
                        17, we expanded our Spanish broadcasting to Latin America from one hour of
                        origination to 19 hours. Within two hours we were on the air. I mention this
                        with some pride. What network could undertake such expansion on such short
                        notice with no change in personnel allowance?</p>
                    <p><pb n="103" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_103"/>There were Latins relaying our
                        broadcasts who said, “you are too honest, you will be misunderstood.” There
                        were Americans who protested, as the letter writer from California who heard
                        the tirades of Dr. Raul Roa<note n="9" xml:id="d32fn9">Reference is Cuban
                            Foreign Minister Raul Roa.</note> on our Spanish broadcasts and
                        suggested we leave such broadcasting to the Voice of Castro. The answer was
                        that Dr. Roa was speaking in the United Nations debate which we carried in
                        its entirety. We carried the whole story—Castro’s announcement, the
                        self-labelled “invasion”, the writhing in Washington, the agonies in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and even the agonizing reappraisal
                        which a critical aftermath spilled over the Administration.</p>
                    <p>But if truth must be our guide then dreams must be our goal. To the hunger of
                        those masses yearning to be free and to learn, to this sleeping giant now
                        stirring, that is so much of the world, we shall say: “We share your
                        dreams.” As a nation, we have never been allergic to change. Ours was the
                        first of the great revolutions. It is a birthright we do not intend to let
                        go by default. Our responsibilities of nationhood are predicated on a
                        helping hand to others who would elevate their crushing way of existence by
                        change into a more bountiful society. We offer no panaceas, no final
                        solutions. We offer to join in the search for betterment. We offer our
                        experience and our energies in partnership in the quest for greater human
                        excellence. This we not only endorse. This we sponsor and promote, and
                        provoke. A tradition of government by the governed, of revolution by
                        consent—all of these are among the greater virtues that we have to
                        demonstrate to a world sorely in need of great virtues.</p>
                    <p>But we shall go further. We are taking the offensive in this war of ideas. We
                        shall be more alert in exposing Communist techniques and tactics. Distortion
                        and duplicity about this land and its people will not go unanswered.</p>
                    <p>How shall we accomplish this dual role?</p>
                    <p>First, the projects that we launch are delivered abroad, primarily through
                        our posts—218 of them in 98 countries around the world, staffed by some
                        1,200 American men and women and their valuable local assistants. Their
                        relation to Washington is as the rim of a wheel to a hub. We in Washington
                        set policy and direction for our posts abroad, but it is as a service center
                        to our overseas operators that we serve our main function.</p>
                    <p>Second, I have already mentioned that we operate in seven principal media of
                        communication—radio, television, movies, press, book publishing, exhibits
                        and the arts, as well as the all-important field of personal
                        contact—reaching out to all parts of the world in virtually all <pb n="104"
                            facs="0141" xml:id="pg_104"/>languages. As the informational arm of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy, what we do is often imposed
                        on us by the impact of events. But we do not await events. We anticipate,
                        prepare and organize our resources. There is also sometimes a need to
                        concentrate on a selected short range of subject-matter. We have thus
                        established a new post, entitled “Director of Media Content”. This job is to
                        aim our output, to pull together the sinews of our several media, to
                        multiply their effectiveness by combining their effort.</p>
                    <p>Next, we are concentrating our attention on the fields where the ideological
                        competition is being waged. This means expansion in Africa—where new nations
                        have arisen—and in Latin America—where new difficulties have been born—and
                        in Southeast Asia—where new pressures are upon us. We will not do this,
                        however, at the expense of thinning the lines of communication with our
                        traditional friends and allies.</p>
                    <p>To our neighbors to the south, we shall ask them to face the facts about this
                        man called Castro. We shall ask them to recognize the nature of his
                        totalitarian dictatorship, his betrayal of the ideals of the revolution that
                        brought him to power, his suppression of basic human liberties, his treason
                        to the ideals of civilization, and his atrocities, his calculated reliance
                        on the Sino-Soviet bloc and the danger that this threatens to free
                        institutions in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>But we shall do more than merely affirm the negative. We shall examine and
                        explain the promise of the new “Alliance for Progress”, the economic and
                        social promise that can bloom from the new planted seedling of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Latin American cooperation.</p>
                    <p>In Africa, there are new lands emerging with new leaders. It is a continent
                        groping for directions, churning with ideas, surveying our style, sampling
                        our ideals. One need only recall the heady wine of our own independence in
                        1776 to appreciate the new intoxication of Africa. To them we must do more
                        than criticize their politics and caution them on the Soviets. We must share
                        with them our hands and our hearts, our techniques and our time. We must,
                        perhaps above all, accord them the dignity of friendship and respect. In
                        Africa alone we have opened 12 new posts in the past year: Mali, Ivory
                        Coast, Togo, Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, Congo, Gabon, Central African
                        Republic, Chad, Ruanda-Urundi, Malagasy Republic. New countries, all of
                        them, some not even in existence when I assumed this office less than four
                        months ago.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America, we hope to establish 11 new posts in key interior cities,
                        and to strengthen 17 existing posts now undermanned.</p>
                    <p>In Southeast Asia we are taking additional urgent steps to communicate our
                        determination to support our allies and to prevent neutral countries from
                        falling to Communism. Communication in these lands <pb n="105" facs="0142"
                            xml:id="pg_105"/>is poor. Literacy is low. The challenge to our
                        ingenuity and to our energy is great—and it is expensive.</p>
                    <p>Our financing for this year will we hope be adequate. But I would remind you
                        that our budget now awaiting approval was drawn up before the sudden
                        increase in the menace of Castro’s Communism, before the stepped-up
                        Communist assault in Laos and the eroding subversion in South Viet Nam and
                            Thailand.<note n="10" xml:id="d32fn10">In his May 25 special message to
                            the Congress on urgent national needs, the President referenced the
                            “world-wide” struggle the United States faced to “preserve and promote”
                            its ideals. He continued: “That struggle has highlighted the role of our
                            Information Agency. It is essential that the funds previously requested
                            for this effort be not only approved in full, but increased by 2
                            million, 400 thousand dollars, to a total of 121 million dollars.“This
                            new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and
                            Southeast Asia. These tools are particularly effective and essential in
                            the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching
                            millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their
                            fight for freedom.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Kennedy,
                            1961</hi>, p. 399)</note></p>
                    <p>In the matter of financial and manpower substance, our adversaries have a
                        clear advantage. The Soviet bloc spends more money jamming our radio
                        broadcasts than we spend on our entire Agency. Our total budget is less than
                        the cost of one combat loaded <gloss target="#t_Polaris_1">Polaris</gloss>
                        submarine, and it is one fifth of the estimated advertising budget of our
                        armaments manufacturers. One American soap company spends almost as much on
                        advertising as the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> spends explaining
                        U.S. policy abroad.</p>
                    <p>We certainly do not solicit billions for propagating the truth. But this
                        country must be willing to do what must be done—or we will forfeit to the
                        inexorable tide of history our role as the promoters of freedom.</p>
                    <p>Implicit in meeting this challenge is the cost of physical facility. The
                        Voice of America broadcasts 600 hours a week and, including packaged
                        programs, uses up to 62 languages. But, as they say in the trade, let’s look
                        at the competition. We are fourth, ranked in order behind Russia, Communist
                        China, and the United Arab Republic. But we certainly do not intend to
                        remain in fourth position. We are building new transmitters, one in North
                        Carolina, and one in Liberia, but we are seriously handicapped against the
                        opposition because they are already located physically closer to much of the
                        audience we would reach. We have had practically no increase in power since
                        1953 and it is in these years that our competition has passed us.</p>
                    <p>Our broadcast and other activities do need more money, but money alone will
                        not do the job. We need immunization from accordion financing—granting most
                        of our budget requests one year, squeezing them tightly the next. No network
                        or newspaper could flourish on such financial irregularity; neither can
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p><pb n="106" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_106"/>We face a difficult time with
                        staffing. We need more permanent staff—talented people willing to work for
                        little pay and less recognition. And we need the cooperation of the men who
                        help shape the thinking of our citizens. We want them to share their
                        thoughts abroad. In Moscow and Peiping, such intellectuals and journalists
                        are summoned at government bidding. In America, we do not bid; we request.
                        But the argument heard sometimes here that cooperation with the government
                        hampers professional independence is, I submit, specious. We need your help
                        and, while we cannot pay commercial rates, we can offer another
                        compensation: the satisfaction that you helped keep our country strong.</p>
                    <p>The history of this Agency has been brief and turbulent. I trust its future
                        will be long and fruitful. In the bare 20 years of its life, it has had five
                        titles and a dozen different directors. Our origins lie in the frenzied
                        beginnings of World War II, when we operated with a radio and a prayer. Our
                        future may lie in the unseen systems of communications satellites, when we
                        will operate with international television and perhaps those same prayers
                        again.</p>
                    <p>The product of this Agency is all for export, much of it invisible, much of
                        it unknown at home. Much of its end-product effectiveness is not measurable
                        by common standards. We do not have a rating service, and frequently our
                        work is known to the public only when we make a mistake. We do not ask for
                        special consideration, and certainly not for sympathy, from those of you who
                        work in the private sector of communication.</p>
                    <p>We do not ask that our mistakes be ignored, nor that our accomplishments be
                        exaggerated. We shall do our best to tell you what the Agency is doing in
                        the belief that you are as concerned as we in providing the citizens of this
                        country with information as to what is being said and done in their name
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>I have learned since coming to Washington at least two things: the first is
                        that it is easier to ask questions than to answer them, and the second, that
                        questions are never indiscreet but answers sometimes are. I suppose the art

                    <p>They want the United States Government to inform the Thai Government that we
                        have no objection to the film being shot in Thailand.</p>
                    <p>We carefully reviewed the script. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Ed
                            Murrow</persName> read it too. We decided that the U.S. Government most
                        certainly should not give such clearance to the Thais. The film—although
                        somewhat cleaned up—still portrays the United States as a power imposing its
                        will on others. It also portrays an American Ambassador who, by his
                        bull-headedness, causes a bloody upheaval in an underdeveloped Southeast
                        Asian nation.</p>
                    <p>We informed these gentlemen that the U.S. Government took the following
                        position: (1) We have no right or intention of censorship. (2) What you are
                        asking for is a stamp of approval from the United States Government to do
                        the film in Thailand. (3) We cannot grant that stamp of approval. (4) We are
                        advising our embassy in Bangkok to this effect. If they are queried by the
                        Thai Government as to our position, we will inform them that we believe the
                        film is not in the interests of the United States Government or the Thai
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The film makers stated that they still intended to make the film. We said,
                        “Okay. That is obviously none of our business, except insofar as you
                        officially ask the United States Government to help you.”<note n="3"

                    <p>I have the impression that our operations in Africa, particularly in
                        connection with the new posts, parallel too closely the practice of the
                        State Department. We are an operating agency and should concentrate our
                        limited resources in areas of actual or potential strength. I doubt, for
                        example, that posts in Mauritania or Upper Volta will greatly influence the
                        course of future events in Africa.</p>
                    <p>We ought to establish a list of priorities and concentrate our resources and
                        our efforts in those areas. Perhaps you would be good enough to consult with
                        the appropriate people at State and I.C.A. and attempt to produce such a
                        list. We may be able to cover the waterfront but we can’t cover all of
                        Africa. We must decide where to concentrate.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>To facilitate obtaining a fast and accurate appraisal of the effectiveness of
                        a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post, I suggest you:</p>
                    <p>1. Pay an unannounced visit to the Library. How many patrons are there? Are
                        they mostly children or are they obviously members of the Post’s target
                        audiences?</p>
                    <p>2. Check the proportion of Spanish (in Brazil, Portuguese)-language and
                        English-language books on the shelves. Look at the check-out cards in the
                        backs of the books to determine what kinds of books are circulating. Only
                        fiction, or substantive (Americana, biography, political science, communism,
                        and American literature) books as well? Mostly in the local languages, or in
                        English as well?</p>
                    <p>3. Is the Library conveniently accessible to our principal target
                        audiences?</p>
                    <p>4. Take a look at Film Section records. Are substantive as well as
                        entertainment films circulating? Who are our viewers—mostly children or
                        members of target audiences?</p>
                    <p>5. Observe the relationships between the Public Affairs Officer and members
                        of his staff. Does the Public Affairs Officer encourage you to see his
                        colleagues or are you isolated from them?</p>
                    <p>6. See the Ambassador, the Deputy Chief of Mission, the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> Mission Chief and other senior Embassy
                        officials alone. They will be more candid if the Public Affairs Officer is
                        not present.</p>
                    <p>7. Look at what the post distributes to the local newspapers from the
                        Wireless File? Is there a careful selection, editing and rewriting of items?
                        How fast does the material move?</p>
                    <p>8. Ask local editors for their views on the value of our press output and the
                        quality of our translations.</p>
                    <p>9. Look at the type of principal contacts of the Public Affairs Officer,
                        Information Officer and Cultural Officer. Are they key representatives <pb
                            n="110" facs="0147" xml:id="pg_110"/>of the Post’s target audiences, or
                        are they mostly pro-American, English speaking “tame Latinos?”</p>
                    <p>10. Look into the relationship of the Post’s principal, i.e., most time
                        consuming, activities and the Country Plan. Is the Post devoting most of its
                        effort to achievement of specific objectives or is it squandering too much
                        time on activities which are generally useful but only peripheral in terms
                        of our political and psychological objectives?</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I am very anxious to see how rapidly we can move to improve the quality of
                        our educational and cultural representatives overseas. It seems to me that
                        the problem is made urgent by the increased demands we anticipate in the
                        near future.</p>
                    <p>Our Cultural Officers have been required to carry the executive burden of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cultural program, the
                        Department’s educational exchange programs; to demonstrate U.S. letters,
                        art, music, scholarship and other elements of our national culture; and to
                        serve the Ambassador in a variety of ways. I have met a great many of them
                        around the world, and have found them to be dedicated and hard-working
                        public servants. Some have been outstanding, but many lack the professional
                        background essential for a really first-rate job.</p>
                    <p><pb n="111" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_111"/>I know you both agree with me that
                        however well or poorly we may have done in the past, we must be better
                        prepared to keep up with the pace required for the 1960s. The nation’s
                        international responsibilities have quickened, and we must raise our sights
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Our officers must really understand our own culture and have the skills to
                        direct an increased and improved cultural program. They must understand the
                        process by which education builds leaders. They should have real
                        professional competence in the field of American education and the ability
                        to apply that competence with great skill to situations and institutions in
                        foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Our cultural officers will also have to be more fluent in foreign languages,
                        better grounded in alien cultures and better human communicators. They will
                        have to be better trained in the philosophical bases of our society and
                        articulate enough to compete in the market place of ideas. They will have to
                        develop a much closer association with writers, students, economists,
                        educators, etc. They may have to be assigned at foreign posts for much
                        longer periods of time so we may capitalize on their competence as it
                        develops.</p>
                    <p>The need and the opportunity are becoming apparent. I believe we should
                        discuss means, and I am prepared to meet with you at an early date to do
                        so.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The guidelines set forth below are designed to assure maximum appropriate
                        participation of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in the development
                        of State Department country and area policy papers.</p>
                    <p>These papers hopefully will be made available at an early stage (informally
                        by State drafter to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> country desk
                        officer) and will be sent formally to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        at a later stage (State Assistant Secretary to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> Area Director) for comment. The final, approved policy
                        paper will be distributed in Washington and to the field.</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions, please take them up with <persName
                            corresp="#p_BFO_1">Fred Bundy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The guidelines:</p>
                    <p>1. After the Area desk officer has formulated, but before he has transmitted,
                        his comments on the early draft submitted by the State drafter, he should
                        consult with <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> (<persName
                            corresp="#p_BFO_1">Fred Bundy</persName>). This is for the purpose of
                        reviewing the draft policy and Area comments in the context of broad Agency
                        policy and interests. <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> clearance of area
                        comments is not required at this stage.</p>
                    <p>2. After “early stage” informal comments by interested agencies in Washington
                        and the field, and rewriting as necessary, the draft policy will receive
                        substantial clearance within State. Then the appropriate State Asst.
                        Secretary will officially transmit the policy paper to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Area Director for comments, not
                        clearance. The Area Director’s reply should be cleared with <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_BFO_1"
                            >Bundy</persName>) in draft.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> comments should deal with
                        psychological-public attitude-information aspects. However, we should not
                        hesitate to take a broad view of what “psychological” comprises.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> contributions need not be limited
                        to existing Agency policy; however, modified or new policy should receive
                        appropriate Agency <pb n="113" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_113"/>approval prior
                        to its inclusion in comments to State. This applies to comments at both
                        early and later stages. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> activities
                        which have been rejected by the Agency for budgetary or policy reasons
                        should not be included in your suggestions.</p>
                    <p>5. The scope of Agency comments will be governed, to some extent, by the type
                        of material which State has decided to include in a given paper. Wherever
                        possible, we should concentrate on significant policy issues and avoid
                        operational detail.</p>
                    <p>6. We do not believe “psychological” aspects can be compartmentalized any
                        more than “political” can be separated from “economic” or “military”. Some
                        State drafts contain such a breakdown; others do not. Where such a breakdown
                        exists, and in your judgment it is desirable to do so, you may wish to
                        incorporate your contribution into a section entitled “Psychological.”</p>

                    <p>I share your views on the importance of having officers of the highest
                        possible quality conduct our educational and cultural programs abroad. We
                        must, I agree, have officers who can keep up with the pace required for the
                        1960s, who can imaginatively and competently carry on the growing
                        responsibilities of the cultural programs including educational development.
                        The problem is as you know a complex one, and must be tackled on many
                        fronts. I shall be glad to discuss it with you, and welcome your
                        suggestions.</p>
                    <p>To take a new look at the problem, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        last April established an Ad Hoc Committee on Personnel Policies regarding
                        Cultural Affairs Officers. The Director of your Bureau of Educational and

                        this Committee, which is considering a broad range of questions from
                        recruitment to job classification and training. I expect a report shortly
                        that will indicate some lines for further action.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3"
                            >Not found.</note></p>
                    <p>In the meantime let me put down a few thoughts on the matter and list some of
                        the steps we are now taking.</p>
                    <p>Your memorandum (Tab A)<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">Attached but not printed.

                        Officers. It also suggests why we fall short of this high standard in some
                        cases. The requirements for a Cultural Officer are demanding and varied: he
                        should understand and represent well the culture of his own country, be
                        versed in the culture and language <pb n="116" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_116"
                        />of the country in which he works, be skilled in communications techniques,
                        be articulate and strong on personal contacts, and at the same time be a
                        competent administrator of several complex programs.</p>
                    <p>Obviously it is difficult, often impossible, to find persons with all these
                        qualities; we must seek those who most nearly approximate our ideal, fill in
                        the gaps as far as possible through training and experience, and utilize
                        them in the best ways, taking into account their strengths and
                        weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>Steps we are taking and plans for the future include:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Career Opportunities and Development</hi></p>
                    <p>1. While we have not yet succeeded in getting career legislation, a Career
                        Corps was set up by administrative action in July 1960 with full support and
                        encouragement of the State Department. For the long term, a career service
                        will provide <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, as it does State, with
                        the soundest basis for getting and holding high quality personnel.</p>
                    <p>2. We now have the policy that in each major post, one of the two top jobs
                            (<gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> and Deputy, or next ranking
                        officer) should be filled by an officer with a background of cultural
                        work.</p>
                    <p>3. In several major posts we have raised the classification of the Cultural
                        Officer job, and are again re-examining the pattern to be sure it adequately
                        reflects the stature and complexity of cultural affairs work.</p>
                    <p>4. We are seeking to keep our Cultural Officers and other personnel longer at
                        their posts—either for two regular tours of duty, or for one three-year
                        tour.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Selection of Personnel</hi></p>
                    <p>1. The Junior Officer program, inaugurated in 1954, is bringing excellent
                        young material into our Foreign Service. Last year the examination procedure
                        was modified so that the written exam is very close to that of the State
                        Department for its entering Foreign Service Officers. The growing number of
                        candidates and their high quality are encouraging.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> always will need to bring in
                        officers from the outside at mid-career and senior levels. This includes
                        both the outstanding representative of some field of American culture who is
                        not willing to make a career of government service but will serve for one or
                        two tours of duty as a Cultural Attaché, and the man at mid-career in some
                        relevant field (the academic world, the arts, cultural organizations) who is
                        willing to move permanently into <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        work. We are actively seeking both. The attached memorandum gives examples
                        of some of the candidates now under consideration.</p>
                    <p>3. We are also working to improve recruiting methods and expand contacts with
                        universities and other sources of potential candidates.</p>
                    <p><pb n="117" facs="0154" xml:id="pg_117"/><hi rend="italic">Training</hi></p>
                    <p>Our Educational and Cultural Officers, as well as other Foreign Service
                        officers, need far more training than we can now give them. The great
                        problem here is personnel ceilings. At a time when we must open new posts
                        and expand programs in Latin America and Africa, we cannot release officers
                        from active duty for training to the extent that we should. We are, however,
                        taking some steps:</p>
                    <p>1. A new policy on language proficiency went into effect April 1. It sets
                        more stringent requirements than we have ever had before, and will require
                        considerably more language training.</p>
                    <p>2. Next year a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer will be
                        assigned to full-time study in American civilization for one year at an
                        American university. This program recognizes the importance of the field of
                        American civilization to Agency work; we plan eventually to assign more
                        officers to it.</p>
                    <p>3. We are planning a longer training period for Junior Officers in Washington
                        before assignment to their first posts.</p>
                    <p>4. We have a number of other projects under consideration that we hope to
                        develop as personnel ceilings and budget permit. They include: assignment of
                        Cultural Officers to work with an American university (for example, as
                        foreign student adviser) or cultural institution for one or two years during
                        a U.S. assignment; development of special summer seminars for Cultural
                        Officers to bring them up to date on developments in American cultural life,
                        with special emphasis on American education; study trips to educational and
                        cultural institutions and events throughout the U.S. for officers on home
                        leave, so that they will be better equipped to discuss the U.S. with foreign
                        leaders from first-hand, up-to-date knowledge.</p>

                    <p>3. An effective United Nations which has sufficient authority to act in
                        crisis situations is indispensable to the security of small nations. Knowing
                        this, the Soviets are seeking to paralyze the U.N. Secretariat with an
                        unworkable “troika” arrangement.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Reference is to

                            Africa, and Latin America—would have a total of one vote among them in
                            the executive direction of the U.N.—and that vote could be nullified by
                            a veto. The United Nations would be powerless to act on any proposal
                            that did not suit the purposes of the Soviet Union.” (Department of

                        “developing” and “modernizing” is confusing in translation in most

                            ‘Emerging countries’ is not considered so good. The ‘emerging’ has some
                            of the connotations of the old colonialism and is more political than
                            ‘developing’ and ‘modernizing’ which have a more economic meaning.”

                    </list>
                    <p>During the course of attempting to get information in the State Department
                        about some Angolan students, I became aware of a serious short-coming in the
                        procedures followed in handling foreign students in this country.</p>
                    <p>There are, as possibly you know, some 50,000 foreign students in the United
                        States who can represent an enormous potential for good or ill; particularly
                        with respect to the newly emerging nations in Africa and Asia. The future
                        relationship between the United States and these nations will be determined
                        very largely by the attitudes of the leaders of those nations toward us. To
                        send back students who have become disillusioned and embittered after
                        studying in this country is the height of folly—it would be better not to
                        have them than to convert them into enemies. Since the students are in the
                        United States because we want them here and since the national interest is
                        involved, surely it is the responsibility of the U.S. Government to do
                        whatever is necessary to insure that the minimum of ill will and the maximum
                        of good will results from their stay in the United States.</p>
                    <p>With due respect to the many private and voluntary groups and agencies which
                        offer their services to these students—I am told there are 53 such groups in
                        the District of Columbia—too much is at stake to leave the welfare of the
                        students entirely to uncoordinated private enterprise. The fact that many
                        foreign students already have become embittered by their experiences in this
                        country is proof that more needs <pb n="127" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_127"/>to
                        be done. It would appear that there is a definite requirement that the U.S.
                        Government concern itself with the welfare of the students. It could be done
                        by creating an Office for Foreign Student Affairs in the Bureau of
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs, which would:</p>
                    <p>1) serve as a clearing house for information about all foreign students
                        resident in this country;</p>
                    <p>2) encourage the extension and improvement of facilities—public, private,
                        university, and institutional—for advising and guiding foreign students.
                        This office would particularly encourage educational institutions attended
                        by foreign students to have full-time, qualified foreign student advisors
                        and, if necessary, would provide funds for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>3) make available information about employment opportunities for foreign
                        students;</p>
                    <p>4) in so far as the regulations of immigration and naturalization service
                        permit, encourage the business community to provide employment opportunities
                        for these students as a means of helping them to secure a) additional income
                        and b) skills;</p>
                    <p>5) take the initiative in arranging for programs of financial assistance to
                        students where such are required;</p>
                    <p>6) help the colleges and universities finance special academic programs for
                        these students where they are needed;</p>
                    <p>7) transmit to the universities Government funds which may be appropriated
                        for the above purposes and, serve as a channel through which private funds
                        might also flow;</p>
                    <p>8) develop legislative proposals for better foreign student programs in the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>The man who flagged the problem for me was Colonel <persName
                            corresp="#p_MFP_1">Francis Miller</persName>, Special Assistant to
                            <persName corresp="#p_CPH_1">Phil Coombs</persName>; I hasten to add
                        that most of the ideas expressed above are his. <persName corresp="#p_CPH_1"
                            >Coombs</persName> thinks the creation of such an office is a splendid
                        idea, but he is leaving for two weeks in Latin America and all indications
                        are that lack of funds and procedures in the bureaucracy will delay any real
                        action for an indefinite time. I share <persName corresp="#p_MFP_1"
                            >Miller</persName>’s conviction that we should move fast on this one and
                        that is why I think it should be given a push by the White House. I think it
                        is the kind of problem that would be of immediate concern to the President,
                        especially in the light of the unfortunate experiences of some of the
                        students who were brought to the U.S. by the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation.
                        Also, the town is filled with intellectuals who certainly must feel that
                        this is the kind of problem that should be solved now. A new academic year
                        is almost upon us and 50,000 foreign students <pb n="128" facs="0165"

                    <p>A vigorous, imaginative and carefully planned program of major overseas
                        exhibits in support of U.S. foreign policy objectives is in the national
                        interest. The exhibit is a medium of information which is gaining importance
                        as a major form of international communication. As such it can be used to
                        support all aspects of national policy. We can use it as a means of
                        expressing our hopes, desires and potential for further progress, in
                        partnership with others and in the interest of peace and improved well-being
                        for all mankind. We should employ this means effectively for our affirmative
                        purpose of projecting our fundamental attitudes, values and
                        accomplishments.</p>
                    <p><pb n="129" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_129"/>Effective coordination of the plans
                        and programs of the increasing number of our government agencies engaged
                        directly or indirectly in the overseas exhibits field is essential if we are
                        to reap maximum benefits from our efforts. Accordingly, I request you, as
                        the Director of the United States Information Agency, to assume the
                        leadership in bringing about the needed coordination. You are authorized to
                        establish an Interagency Exhibits Committee, which will be chaired by <gloss

                        this Committee shall include such agencies as you deem appropriate.</p>

                        Committee, you will be responsible for reviewing the proposed overseas
                        exhibit activities of the member agencies and for initiating and developing
                        a comprehensive annual program to assure the maximum psychological
                        effectiveness of United States exhibit efforts overseas. In carrying out
                        this task, you will give due consideration to the selection of sites, the
                        scope and general subject of each exhibit, and time schedules to avoid
                        unnecessary duplication or overlapping. As Chairman you may establish ad hoc
                        planning groups selected from appropriate member agencies for each
                        exhibit.</p>
                    <p>I am also requesting the member agencies, in developing their exhibits
                        programs, to seek your advice with respect to the overseas informational
                        policy and objectives of the U.S.</p>

                            which is taking place in America. All the group appeared to feel that we

                        comment in <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi> added that the reasons given by
                        Moscow for its decision did not justify it. <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi>’s
                        editorial was the first reaction by any official Yugoslav organ to the

                    <p>For whatever value it may be to you, to any successor in my job or to anyone
                        else in <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>, I am setting down some
                        thoughts on various aspects of long-range planning of our information work
                        on the basis of three and a half years in this assignment.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Initiating vs. Reacting</hi>. There are several reasons,
                        largely historical and perhaps inevitable, for our tendency as a nation to
                        continue to react to the communist challenge rather than to lay our own
                        challenge down to the other side. One reason, however, is bureaucratic. We
                        simply do not have enough people whose job it is to concentrate exclusively
                        on developing plans, proposals, projects to take the psychological
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>If there is only one long-range planning officer in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, who is free of the treadmill, (and, as I indicate later,
                        this is not enough), his primary task might well be to develop and feed such
                        proposals through the chief of <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> to the
                        Director. If this is not made his primary task, it is extremely easy for
                        even a “long-range planning” officer to get bogged down in a mass of routine
                        paper with no time or mental energy left for developing major proposals.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Concentration of Effort</hi>. <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >IOP</gloss> has made a major step forward with the establishment of the
                        Media Content job. This will help focus media effort, at least, on priority
                        themes. Beyond this, however, long-range planning generally should be
                        constantly concerned with keeping a few main concepts and approaches in the
                        foreground of the Agency’s attention in all its efforts.</p>
                    <p>The emphasis of such planning should be on concepts and approaches which have
                        an inherent forward thrust. In regard to concepts, there should be
                        consistent attention to themes which attach “wave of the future”
                        connotations to American or Free world activities and which expose the
                        backwardness of Sino-Soviet ideology and behav<pb n="134" facs="0171"
                            xml:id="pg_134"/>ior. In regard to approaches, long-range planning
                        should be directed to proposals, devices, materials and operating techniques
                        which will effectively reach and influence those audience groups from which
                        future leadership elements are likely to emerge—notably students, political
                        and trade union activists, and younger leadership echelons of the
                        managerial, professional, educational and military ranks.</p>
                    <p>Many of the things that need to be done to maintain this priority attention
                        fall between area and media stools. Only a central office such as <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> can push them through and see that they
                        get the proper support. (For example: Cultivating Asian and African students
                        in European universities; or the “Forum” program for students, educators and
                        professionals involving <gloss target="#t_IBS_1">IBS</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICS_1"
                        >ICS</gloss>.)</p>

                            >USIA</gloss> is presumably the U.S. Government’s primary agency
                        concerned with international information, persuasion and communication. One
                        would expect it, therefore, to be the repository of the nation’s best
                        talent, know-how and experience in this field. Yet over its decade or more
                        of existence, the Agency has not developed any recognizable body of
                        communications doctrine, either in terms of theory or practical techniques,
                        on which to base its operations. Basic questions remain not only unanswered
                        but even untackled. There is no accepted Agency view, for instance, on who
                        our primary audiences are or even any suggested method for a <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> to determine what his audience priorities
                        should be. We still operate largely by habit, routine, and widely varied
                        individual seat-of-the-pants experience. Some operators are very good
                        because of a fortunate combination of intuition and experience. Many are not
                        so good. To some extent, this will always be the case. But it requires a
                        more directed, organized, combined planning, research and training effort
                        than we have so far produced to fashion a truly professional operation
                        spending more than $100,000,000 a year to achieve major objectives in the
                        national interest.</p>
                    <p>A key element in this is our research program. Relative to the need, it is
                        now puny. We must know a great deal more than we do about audiences, levels
                        of understanding and sophistication, communication patterns, effectiveness
                        of local media, views and aspirations of major groupings, semantics on a
                        country and language basis, and the effectiveness of our own materials and
                        programs. We are doing a little, here and there, on all these things but
                        there is no overall strategic plan for filling in the major gaps in the
                        knowledge required for intelligent programming. Nor is there as yet any
                        organized culling of the vast amount of existing academic, commercial and
                        other governmental research in related fields for the nuggets of findings
                        that would be of operational use to the Agency.</p>
                    <p>The long-range planning function can have a major role here, in helping focus
                        increased research activity on the major continuing prob<pb n="135"
                            facs="0172" xml:id="pg_135"/>lems of international information
                        operations, and in suggesting ways to insure that the useful findings of
                        such research are geared into Agency operations and infused into our
                        training programs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Program Projections</hi>. The greater part of Agency
                        planning is budget directed rather than program directed. It is largely tied
                        to the annual budgeting cycle and most decisions are made on the basis of
                        retaining or slightly altering the dollar amounts attached to each activity,
                        post, area or medium. To gear the Agency’s operations more effectively to
                        future needs, it is desirable to develop, from time to time, projections in
                        purely program terms for some years ahead. If foreseeable program needs are
                        set down by area and media with little reference to present budgeting levels
                        and these estimates are refined and coordinated by <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >IOP</gloss>, realistic planning goals can be established towards which
                        annual budget exercises can be directed. This would serve to orient our
                        programs more toward field and area needs and less to entrenched parochial
                        interests, particularly those of the media services.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Looking Ahead</hi>. Planning beyond the next day’s output
                        or next year’s budget should be the task of all policy-making and
                        decision-making elements of the Agency. But the stark fact is that, in this
                        Agency as in the rest of the government, what is everybody’s business is
                        nobody’s business.</p>
                    <p>The daily treadmill entraps even the specialist officers in <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>. Unless there are people specially
                        enjoined to keep their eyes on future possibilities and problems and future
                        implications of current operations and trends, a great deal of essential
                        long-range planning will never take place. This function in <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> should not be considered as the exclusive
                        locale for long-range planning in the Agency. On the contrary, apart from
                        such specialized tasks as those listed in the paragraphs above and which
                        themselves require Agency-wide cooperation, <gloss target="#t_IOP_1"
                            >IOP</gloss>’s long-range planning personnel should be urging others in
                            <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> and, through appropriate channels,
                        other elements of the Agency to do their own long-range planning and should
                        be drawing their attention to those aspects of their respective spheres
                        which particularly require it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Contingency Planning</hi>. There is virtually no
                        contingency planning in the Agency for the effective deployment of our
                        “weapon on the wall” under changed world political conditions or in response
                        to plausible world developments. The recent Berlin package planning is a
                        rare exception. But sound contingency planning efforts involve more than
                        media content. In the fast moving events of today, we should have plans
                        ready for drastically different use of some of our primary instruments, such
                        as the Voice, than anyone has presently given much thought to.</p>
                    <p>There is danger in going overboard on contingency planning, both in the
                        excessive manpower and resources it can waste on plans which <pb n="136"
                            facs="0173" xml:id="pg_136"/>never get used and in its possible
                        encroachment on the more essential and valuable kind of planning which
                        develops initiatives to take the psychological offensive instead of merely
                        responding to “contingencies” which are generally created by the other side.
                        But this does not mean that we should have no contingency planning at all. A
                        major part of this might properly be set in motion by <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Staffing</hi>. If all of these things—developing proposals
                        for initiatives, keeping the focus on forward-thrust concepts and
                        approaches, improving our communications know-how and techniques, projecting
                        programs beyond annual budget cycles, spurring strategic planning in the
                        rest of the Agency, and making psychological operations plans for major
                        contingencies and opportunities—if all these things are worth doing, and
                        need to be done in <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>, they cannot be
                        done, or done adequately, by one officer.</p>
                    <p>In my own case, I had to decide which of these were most worth doing and let
                        the rest go. For instance, I did not touch contingency planning because I
                        felt this could become an endless task with no time left over to work on
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> initiatives, which I regarded as more
                        essential and rewarding. I barely got started on a working group to organize
                        Agency effort on communications doctrine and technique. In some of the other
                        fields I was able to do a bit more.</p>
                    <p>I agree with the findings of a Management survey last year<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d48fn2">Not found.</note> that this whole field of long-range
                        planning requires a three- or four-man group, with some specialization of
                        function among its members for the tasks mentioned in this memorandum, but
                        able as a unit to originate ideas for taking the initiative on a large
                        scale, to examine ideas suggested by other elements of the government or
                        outside, and to develop the more useful ideas into detailed proposals that
                        can be submitted to the Director.</p>

                        I have discussed our information program with friendly officials from
                        several Latin American governments. There has been general agreement that
                        this program is not as effective as it should be, that it does not reach
                        enough people, especially among those groups which we are trying to
                        reach—e.g., students, intellectuals, workers and rural workers.</p>
                    <p>This is not a reflection upon the operations of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, but upon the assumptions which underlie our present
                        information programs.</p>
                    <p>This assumption is that official U.S. Government propaganda is capable of
                        swaying the minds and feelings of Latin American peoples toward democracy
                        and away from communism.</p>
                    <p>This kind of propaganda can be most effective behind the iron curtain, where
                        access to normal media of information is cut off and where governments are
                        unfriendly. It is not completely effective in Latin America—with its
                        thousands of free newspapers and radio programs, and where the basic concern
                        is with urgent national and personal problems. Official propaganda is also
                        limited by its inability to appeal to the most powerful political emotions,
                        e.g., militant nationalism, the desire for radical social reform, etc., and
                        many other things for which active U.S. espousal would constitute
                        “interference” in the affairs of a friendly government. Our problem in Latin
                        America is not “unfriendly” governments; it is unfriendly people in friendly
                        countries—an almost impossible situation for official and overt propaganda
                        agencies. Thus we are only able to play around the edges of the real
                        problems and the vital issues which strike emotional chords in each
                        country.</p>
                    <p><pb n="138" facs="0175" xml:id="pg_138"/>I believe that the answer to this
                        problem lies in dissemination of the means of propaganda, rather than the
                        direct dissemination of propaganda. We must place in the hands of effective
                        democratic groups in each country—political parties, labor organizations,
                        church groups, etc.—the instruments of propaganda. This can range from the
                        donation of radio transmitters to making available leaflets, paperback
                        books; and technical assistance in programming, movie making, etc.</p>
                    <p>The mileage we would get from our propaganda dollar in this way would be, I
                        am convinced, far greater than anything we have hitherto achieved.</p>
                    <p>It would be necessary to organize for such an effort, since neither the
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss> is presently equipped to carry it on—and much of it would
                        have to be covert to avoid compromising the position of the groups we are
                        aiding.</p>
                    <p>My first thought is the establishment—within the State Department—of a small
                        office of information which would select recipients, distribute funds and
                        have access to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> staff for the technical work necessary.
                        Probably no more than half a dozen people could administer this program for
                        Latin America.</p>
                    <p>But regardless of the ultimate organization, this is an urgent problem. No
                        matter how great the volume of resources we pour into Latin America, or how
                        fast, it will be a long time before the tangible effects of foreign aid are
                        felt by the average citizen. In the interim, the problem is to create a
                        sense of movement, of concern for the people, and to combat the effective
                        propaganda of the communists. The battle is a psychological one, and will be
                        for some time.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I recommend you establish a small committee of State, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        and White House—four men—to formulate the details of organization for such
                        an effort and to come up with tentative budget suggestions. This work can be
                        done in two to three weeks. Of course, most of the present <gloss

                            to the “next Augustan age,” but he could not see the text due to sun
                            glare and instead recited one of his older poems “The Gift

                            n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">In his inaugural address, the President stated:
                            “Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though
                            arms we need—not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call
                            to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out,
                            ‘rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation’—a struggle against the
                            common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself. Can we
                            forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and
                            South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all
                            mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?” (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Public Papers: Kennedy, 1961</hi>, p. 2)</note> By this and other
                        declarations, this administration has committed itself, before the country
                        and the world, to cultural advancement as a major national aim. It will now
                        want to address itself to fulfilling this commitment.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. National and World Importance</p>
                    <p>That other great issues at home and abroad press upon the nation does not
                        mean that this is the wrong moment to start. On the contrary, in times like
                        these, the decisive national resources are courage and resolution, and
                        nothing can add to these as well as the vision of a worthy goal beyond
                        current crises and the sense of moving toward it despite stalemate or
                        setback elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>At the least, therefore, a serious effort to improve the quality of American
                        cultural life would be a boost to national morale. It would inevitably be
                        more. It would confirm that in the endless striving for peace and material
                        well-being, we have not lost sight of why we want them. And if it resulted,
                        as thoughtfully and energetically carried out it surely could, in restoring
                        the pursuit of happiness to the place it had in American thought and faith
                        at the time of the Declaration of <pb n="140" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_140"
                        />Independence, it would do no less than transform the national character
                        and open, for the whole world to see, an exhilarating new chapter in the
                        American Revolution for the nineteen sixties.</p>
                    <p>In our international relations, establishment of cultural advancement as a
                        major aim of the United States could not fail to make us more effective.
                        Among nations of like heritage and development, it would raise our standing
                        as a leader; it would make the less developed nations think better of us as
                        a model; and to the nations of the Soviet bloc, it would show devotion on
                        our part to a humanism transcending political differences, a demonstration
                        which holds more promise than any other approach tried thus far of bringing
                        forth affirmative response from their side. Arts, letters, and learning are
                        the only goods for which a world common market exists. In a world otherwise
                        divided on fundamentals, this cultural common market has better prospect of
                        thriving than any other institution of unifying tendency. If it does thrive,
                        ties will be established among peoples as never before and a new force will
                        be at work everywhere to make peace durable.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. Main Elements of a Policy: Views of the Executive
                        Branch</p>
                    <p>The foregoing observations provide the central premises of a national
                            cultural<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">It is in order to say what the term
                                <hi rend="italic">culture</hi> as used here means. Culture is not
                            seen as something apart from life, a set of superficial adornments to
                            add or take away, but as an element, infused and inseparable, of the
                            main stream. It shows itself not just in museums, concert halls,
                            theaters, and universities, but in homes, clothes, talk, cities,
                            villages, parks, roads, packages, automobiles, gadgets, churches, radio,
                            television, cemeteries, baseball stadiums—a list without end. Yet, in
                            this context, culture must mean less than the whole complex of
                            attainments, beliefs, traditions, excellences, and deficiencies which
                            differentiate one nation from another. It may be enough for present
                            purposes to say that culture is art, letters, and learning as
                            distinguished from skill, didactic writing, and professional knowledge;
                            that although, like the latter, it may be utilitarian as well, its
                            distinguishing qualities are elevation and aesthetic value; that it is
                            spiritual rather than materialistic; that it is an integral and
                            pervasive element of human existence; and that it is the clearest and
                            most direct expression of man’s aspirations and capacity. [Footnote is
                            in the original.]</note> policy: that cultural advancement is of crucial
                        importance to the nation and the world; that it must now be recognized as a
                        major national goal; and that, in setting priorities on expenditure of
                        effort and resources, it must be treated accordingly.</p>
                    <p>For present purposes, it would be premature to put forward, however
                        tentatively, a more detailed statement. The particulars of a national
                        cultural policy should not be proposed <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>, but
                        should emerge from assiduous study of a number of specific issues of which
                        the attached list is illustrative. Before such a study is started, a
                        sounding of opinion within the Executive Branch should be made to determine,
                        first, whether the cultural policy just stated in broad outline is
                        acceptable as a starting point, and second, whether the prospect of support
                            <pb n="141" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_141"/>is sufficiently good to justify
                        further effort to work out the policy fully and put it into effect. If the
                        response is positive, organizing for action is the immediate next step.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. Organizing for Action</p>
                    <p>For a program of cultural advancement, the Executive Branch, which must be
                        the moving force, is strong in the essentials: the President and Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kennedy</persName>, whose personal
                        identification with arts, letters, and learning is universally known and
                        respected, are ideally suited for leadership in this field; cultural
                        leaders, able and willing to contribute ideas, advice, and effort have
                        joined the Administration in good number; public reaction promises to be
                        dominantly favorable; Congressional support seems to be getting stronger;
                        and private citizens, organizations, business enterprises, labor unions, and
                        foundations, as well as academic institutions, learned and professional
                        societies, and religious groups can be counted upon to give their
                        backing.</p>
                    <p>One lack within the Executive Branch is an administrative unit specially
                        qualified to set this new departure in motion. The only agencies of the
                        Federal Government officially invested with responsibilities in this field
                        are the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the State Department,
                        the United States Information Agency, and the Department of Health,
                        Education, and Welfare. By the terms of their legislative mandates, State
                        and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are concerned primarily with
                        international cultural programs, and <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>
                        with domestic. Moreover, the authorized activities of each fall within one
                        or more strictly defined fields, with the consequence that none of the three
                        can claim that by experience or statutory prescription it is the indicated
                        instrument for launching a comprehensive program of cultural advancement.
                        Nor could the three taken together. A first step should therefore be the
                        establishment of a steering committee to lay out strategy and get the
                        campaign under way.</p>
                    <p>The steering committee should have as few members as compatible with being
                        broadly representative. It should be made up of individuals who both <hi
                            rend="italic">ex officio</hi> and as a matter of personal faith can be
                        counted upon to work wholeheartedly. In addition to representatives of the
                        White House, State, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and <gloss
                            target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>, it might draw from the following: the
                        Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Interior (esp. National
                        Parks), the Smithsonian Institution, the National Science Foundation, and
                        although it would mean going outside the strict confines of the Executive
                        Branch, the Library of Congress. Without blinking the requirement of small
                        size, it should remain open to such additional representatives of the
                        Executive Branch as in the opinion of the members would increase its
                        effectiveness. The task of the steering committee should be twofold: (1) to
                        develop a comprehensive national cultural <pb n="142" facs="0179"
                            xml:id="pg_142"/>policy; and (2) to work out and set in motion a plan of
                        action to put it into effect. The first specific objective of the committee
                        should be tentative formulation of both the policy and the plan of action
                        for review with the President. As soon afterwards as feasible, a conference
                        of cultural and intellectual leaders should be called for the purpose of
                        advancing the work of the committee and stirring public interest and
                            support.<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">In an October 16 memorandum to

                            will recommend that the President discuss the matter with you. The

                    <p>2. We believe the United States has very considerable resources for waging
                        effective propaganda-political warfare. As we use this phrase, it refers to
                        the whole range of activities designed to influence the attitudes of peoples
                        on the great issues of the day and to stimulate public support and the
                        active support of public and private individuals and organizations
                        throughout the world for the U.S. position on these issues. The resources
                        our country can use in this contest are dispersed in many places—in the
                        executive departments of the Government, in our embassies abroad, and in
                        many private organizations at home and abroad. This dispersion makes
                        centralized direction difficult—indeed, there is no single agency short of
                        the President with authority to direct all these elements. The committee
                        found that this condition makes it difficult if not impossible to determine
                        how well or badly we are doing in the propaganda-political warfare field.
                        Views as to our effectiveness differ somewhat among the members of the
                        committee, but we are unanimous in feeling that the United States must do
                        better and that to do better there is need for more centralized direction
                        and responsibility at the Washington level.</p>
                    <p>3. We make the following recommendations which have the concurrence of the
                        Secretary of State:</p>
                    <p>a. That the Secretary of State appoint a Special Assistant for Special
                        Projects (the title is tentative) to give full time to the coordination and
                        overall supervision of all United States resources in the
                        propaganda-political warfare field.</p>
                    <p>b. That the Secretary of State call upon the other federal agencies with a
                        capability in this field to contribute a senior official to form an
                        interdepartmental task force to work under the Special Assistant.</p>
                    <p>c. That, as an early step, the Special Assistant review United States results
                        in exploiting the Soviet action in sealing off West Berlin and comment on
                        the adequacy of these results.</p>
                    <p><pb n="144" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_144"/>d. That the President approve the
                        foregoing recommendations and refer this paper to the Secretary of State for
                            implementation.<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4">In a September 20 memorandum

                    <p>It was agreed that in general the various Agencies affected by the Act would
                        continue to carry out those functions provided for in the Act which were
                        being carried out by those Agencies under old legislation. Under the new Act
                        the President is authorized to carry out all of the <pb n="145" facs="0182"
                            xml:id="pg_145"/>activities by delegation. It was suggested that new
                        activities authorized by the Act would be expected to come to the Secretary
                        of State unless otherwise provided for in an Executive Order.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that after consultation among the various Agencies involved a
                        draft Executive Order, if possible agreeable to all, would go forward to the
                        Bureau of the Budget and the White House. Among the interested Agencies are
                        Commerce, Health, Education and Welfare, Immigration and Naturalization
                        Service, and Internal Revenue. It was pointed out that after the first
                        Executive Order is issued it will be difficult to change the allocations of
                        operating responsibility.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that a joint staff would be set up to operate the Cultural
                        Presentations Program. This Program can now come out of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> budget and form part of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> budget. However, formal <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> participation in policy formulation, the
                        laying out of tours, and the like would be highly useful. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CPH_1">Coombs</persName> expressed the desire to make the
                        program a much more flexible vehicle. He said he had in mind smaller touring
                        groups able to travel outside of the capitals of foreign countries,
                        particularly among schools and colleges. He said he wanted to recruit more
                        young talent. He felt the Government should not shoulder all of the costs of
                        the more spectacular attractions playing in the capitals, and particularly
                        should not pay big salaries to the stars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1"
                            >Murrow</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has
                        access to Hollywood talent, and that this talent might be better used if a

                    <p>It was agreed that a joint Department-<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>

                        It follows that we must take the route of acquisition, adaptation and
                        distribution. We have the distribution facilities pretty well all over the
                        world. We have no desire to compete with the networks in areas where they
                        have the possibility to make commercial sales. What we would like is access
                        to their product in order that we may adapt and distribute it in areas where
                        television is developing, where young stations cannot afford to pay
                        commercial rates.</p>
                    <p>The networks have a backlog of material which we can put to good use, such as

                    <p>The delay in securing clearance is one of the principal difficulties. If each
                        network would appoint one official to deal with us in regard to both radio
                        and television clearances, the problem would be simplified.</p>
                    <p>The National Association of Broadcasters has had under informal consideration
                        a project designed to eliminate illiteracy in one country in one year
                        through the combined use of radio and television. We have suggested that
                        Guatemala would probably be the best country for such a pilot project. If
                        you were to suggest that the national interests would be served by such an
                        undertaking, it would be helpful.</p>
                    <p>American television programs are being exported in increasing volume. The
                        impact of television in some areas is coming to equal, if not surpass, that
                        of movies. The networks regard this export primarily, if not exclusively, in
                        terms of income and disregard the impact. Their salesmen bundle up whatever
                        is available and sell it regardless of content, without regard for the
                        damage it may do the American image abroad. A few words from you might cause
                        them to scrutinize their export in terms of impact as well as income.</p>
                    <p>You might care to suggest that we could make use of an occasional documentary
                        dealing with this Nation’s accomplishments in such fields as agricultural
                        research, the accomplishments and progress of the <pb n="148" facs="0185"
                            xml:id="pg_148"/>American Negro, public health, desalinization of water,
                        and medical research.</p>
                    <p>What we seek primarily is prompt access to the networks’ output in order that
                        we may adapt and distribute in areas where they have no possibilities of a
                        commercial sale, and that they exercise their own policy control regarding
                        television shows exported abroad to insure a balanced image of the United
                        States.</p>

                            looking into the problem posed by Moscow Molly and Berlin Benny in
                            taking over the frequency of the U.S. Army’s station in Berlin at
                            midnight. Under the present circumstances, I believe there is no doubt
                            that the U.S. forces must pre-empt the frequency by staying on the air
                            around the clock.” <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>
                            suggested that “whatever funds, materials, and personnel” required be
                            “diverted immediately” from other areas: “We should be able to lick this
                            one in a matter of days, or less.” (Ibid.)</note> The Army, as Executive
                        Agent for Defense, was working on the problem when your memorandum arrived
                        and has asked for just a little more time for more information from the
                        field before making firm recommendations for action.</p>
                    <p>The problem which confronts us is not merely the technical question of
                        pre-empting the Berlin frequency from 0105 to 0600. The major problem cannot
                        be resolved only in the light of the <gloss target="#t_AFN_1">AFN</gloss>
                        Berlin operation. Although <gloss target="#t_AFN_1">AFN</gloss> enjoys
                        national protection within West Germany, it has no legal right to
                        international protection of frequencies. A modification in Berlin could
                        cause repercussions with <gloss target="#t_AFN_1">AFN</gloss> stations in
                        Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as Berlin since these stations now operate
                        on frequencies registered solely to the Soviet Union. The problem is <pb
                            n="149" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_149"/>complicated by the fact that other
                        West European stations and satellite stations also operate on Soviet
                        registered frequencies.</p>
                    <p>We are interested in a quick and efficient solution, but want to make certain
                        that our entire operation is not jeopardized and that we are prepared to
                        cope with any Soviet countermeasures. I have been assured that final

                    <p>You requested information on Castro’s present influence throughout Latin
                        America. Attached is a one-page summary produced by our research department.
                        They read a wide variety of Latin American newspapers as well as study
                        intelligence reports and State Department cables. This represents their
                        considered opinion at the present.</p>
                    <p>I have instituted a new survey to be conducted at five metropolitan areas
                        where a similar sample of the population was taken in January (we sent you
                        the results of this survey on February 23, 1961).<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2"
                            >Not found.</note> The five selected cities are Mexico City, Rio de
                        Janeiro, Lima, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo. These have been selected
                        because we have Regional Research Officers in the first three and there are
                        adequate research facilities available in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The
                        January sample for these cities was 400 cases each, whereas the new survey
                        will be 300 cases each to lower the cost without materially lessening the
                        value of the results. The estimated cost for this follow-up survey is
                        $7,000. The results should be available within thirty days.<note n="3"

                        <p>Available evidence indicates Castro’s influence is declining in Latin
                            America. Several factors are contributing to this trend. Activities of
                            anti-Castro forces are increasing in several countries. The current U.S.
                            policy of ignoring Castro is robbing him of “Yankee Imperialism”
                            ammunition. And there is an increasing awareness of the possibilities of
                            the Alliance for Progress.</p>
                        <p>The trend of events in Cuba and the heavy-handed actions of Cuban
                            diplomats, coupled with the tone of Cuban statements addressed to the
                            Latin American masses and the dangerous, sometimes violent, activities
                            of local Castro supporters and Communists, have led the moderate
                            elements to take action. The visible result of this new trend among the
                            moderates has been an increasing number of anti-Castro organizations,
                            more effective measures to control Cuban propaganda, and a subsequent
                            decline in the attendance at pro-Cuban activities.</p>
                        <p>The decline in the “headline” war between the United States and Cuba
                            shifted the spotlight to Cuba’s attitude towards the other Latin
                            American countries. It was no longer evident that the battle was solely
                            one between David and Goliath. This was dramatically illustrated by the
                            failure of the April invasion,<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d24fn3">footnote 3, Document 24</ref>.</note> which
                            made it clear to Latin American leaders and moderates that they would
                            have to act on their own to fend off the onslaught of Castro-communism.
                            This realization has gradually spread to all but the most radical
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>Though some confusion still exists as to the precise scope of the
                            Alliance for Progress, it is being looked to as an alternative to the
                            Cuban approach. Some of the confusion appears to be deliberately created
                            to serve the interests of particular groups, some conservative and some
                            communist-inspired. Some local leaders are apparently convinced that
                            their ability to prevent the growth of Castroism among the masses
                            depends upon their ability to show that the Alliance can contribute to
                            the fulfillment of their aspirations. Therefore, the failure of these
                            governments to show tangible results and the failure of any <pb n="151"
                                facs="0188" xml:id="pg_151"/>reform movements, which could be
                            attributed to U.S. failure to implement the Alliance for Progress, could
                            act to revive the Cuban experiment as an alternative.</p>

                        <p>Modernization is a basically revolutionary movement that is now under way
                            in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Probably its most essential, and
                            certainly its most prominent aspect is a desire for economic and social
                            development. The new <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program<note

                            and technical assistance to the newly developing countries in their
                            modernization efforts—in the Western Hemisphere through the Alliance for
                            Progress—during what President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"

                        <p>The task of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in this connection is
                            two-fold. Broadly, we must interpret the <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> program to all our audiences in the context of U.S.
                            policy in the world of the 1960’s. We should seek:</p>
                        <p>(1) To make clear that the U.S. welcomes the modernizing revolution, with
                            its promise of economic growth and the strengthening of freedom and
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>(2) To make clear also that in offering development assistance we accept
                            the obligations and welcome the opportunities our position in world
                            affairs entails.</p>
                        <p>(3) To encourage people of other free industrialized countries to
                            recognize that they too share in these obligations and opportunities to
                            shape the kind of world in which the 1960’s will end.</p>
                        <p>(4) To help the peoples of the newly developing nations understand the
                            basis on which we offer our cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The more demanding part of our task centers on (4). It will be our
                            responsibility to help audiences in the newly developing countries gain
                            some appreciation of the complex nature of modernization and understand
                            how the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program can help them meet
                            the requirements <pb n="153" facs="0190" xml:id="pg_153"/>of economic
                            and social development without prejudice to their sovereignty and
                            independence.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Points to Emphasize</hi></p>
                        <p>In this educational effort, we should emphasize the following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) The major push toward progress must be supplied by the people of any
                            country. Otherwise, help from the outside cannot be effective and cannot
                            be justified. Self-help, self-reliance, self-discipline are
                            indispensable if economic development and modernization are to take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>(2) Modern technology and monetary aid can accelerate the process of
                            modernization but cannot bypass the fact that it is a process, one that
                            takes time and imposes different requirements at succeeding stages of
                            development.</p>
                        <p>(3) Modernization doesn’t just “happen.” It must be planned for and
                            worked for. This planning must look to the future, so that each stage of
                            the development process will produce readiness for the next step toward
                            sustained growth. (“Showy” projects not properly geared to a country’s
                            true needs will often lead only to disappointment and may even slow down
                            the rate of development.)</p>
                        <p>(4) Countries desiring a progressive improvement in their productive
                            capacity and standards of living will find the United States ready and
                            able to help, provided that those countries have a businesslike plan,
                            will carry out their own tasks responsibly, including necessary reforms,
                            and are realistic in the kind and scale of development projects they
                            propose to undertake.</p>
                        <p>(5) A major requirement of modernization programs is that all the people
                            of the country being aided shall be able to share in the benefits as
                            improvements in productive capacity and trade bring increases in goods
                            and services.</p>
                        <p>We shall need to bear in mind, as we explain these fundamentals, that our
                            assistance is designed basically to assure that these countries may
                            pursue their course of modernization effectively and independently, so
                            that each fashions the kind of modern society it wants. (We rely on the
                            independence of this process and on their experience in the cooperative
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> effort to result in their
                            choosing their own versions of what we would recognize as a democratic
                            and open society.)</p>
                        <p>We bear in mind, too, that our emphasis must consistently be on
                            modernization, not on the U.S. contribution. We must concern ourselves
                            with understanding the problems of people who find themselves caught up
                            in a revolutionary situation. We must constantly remind ourselves of the
                            stresses and strains, the conflict between progress toward modernity and

                                xml:id="pg_154"/>interests, that are unavoidable under such
                            circumstances. These problems of group and individual adjustment, these
                            national and cultural “growing pains,” will appear in many different
                            forms. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as well as <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> must be prepared to deal with them as
                            understandingly and effectively as possible, month after month and year
                            after year, as the Decade of Development progresses.</p>
                        <p>It follows from this that in our explanation of the general <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> approach and of its application in
                            specific country programs we focus attention on how it helps meet the
                            diverse modernization requirements of the emerging countries. The merit
                            of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> lies not in the instruments of
                            policy it uses, but in the appropriateness and suitability of those
                            instruments for promoting modernization. These basic instruments are
                            four in number:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Long-term loans</hi>—to supplement a country’s own

                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Development grants</hi>—to help make good
                            shortcomings in human resources, through provision of or improvement in

                            education and facilities for transportation, sanitation, health, and
                            housing.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Food-for-Peace shipments</hi>—to enable a country
                            to release farm workers for nonagricultural projects without waiting for
                            its own agriculture to be made more efficient.</p>

                    <p>Is there any way by which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> might offer
                        supplies of uncontaminated powdered milk for distribution in fall-out areas?
                        (See attached clipping from the <hi rend="italic">London Daily
                            Telegraph.</hi>)<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">Attached but not printed.
                            The October 25 clipping features an article entitled “Babies Will Get
                            Safe Milk.” The article notes that the British Minister of Defense had
                            stated in the House of Commons on October 24 that the British Government
                            would provide uncontaminated powdered milk to babies up to a year old if
                            the Soviet bomb tests increased the amount of radioactive iodine 131 in
                            milk to dangerous levels.</note> This would obviously involve some
                        cooperation with the Food for Peace Program and possibly with <gloss

                    <p>This kind of problem raises one aspect of political warfare coordination
                        which has concerned me. Most meddlers in this field seem preoccupied with
                        improving coordination among <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, and State. Actually coordination among
                        these three agencies has not been too bad. The more troubling area, so far
                        as I can see, lies in the relationship between the aid agencies (<gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, Food for Peace, Peace Corps) and the
                        political warfare agencies. Some of our economic programs have vast
                        political implications; but I am not sure<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3"

                        aid effort is always effectively tied in with our general political
                        strategy. This is one place where better coordination is surely
                        required.</p>
                    <p>It would be excellent if <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s new Director
                        of Public Information could be a man with an interest in and an instinct for

                    <p>The President gave me a personal mission to accomplish with the Director of
                        Radio Free Europe which I took up and resolved with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RJJ_1">John Richardson</persName>, the recently-appointed
                        (May 1) Director.</p>
                    <p>In resolving this small problem, I had an opportunity to talk to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJJ_1">Richardson</persName> at length. He has
                        also briefed General <persName corresp="#p_TMD_1">Taylor</persName> a bit on
                        their activities. This much background might be helpful:</p>
                    <p>Radio Free Europe is doing a very fine job broadcasting into the satellite
                        areas especially. For a while, their reduction in personnel and other
                        problems caused considerable trouble, and the European operation was going
                        downhill. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ_1">Richardson</persName>
                        reports that he now has Major General C. Rodney Smith, United States Army,
                        Retired, <pb n="157" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_157"/>as the Operational Chief
                        in Munich and, at latest report, things are smoothed out, there are no
                        troubles with the West German labor unions, and the morale is high—this
                        latter in spite of the fact that since July, General Smith has had to reduce
                        his force by over a hundred employees.</p>
                    <p>The critical problem is the budget. For the past five years, there has been a
                        steady decline in the budget of RFE. The public fund-raising has contributed
                        about the same amount each year—I believe around $2 million. And the rest is
                        budgeted directly from the Bureau of the Budget through a Government agency.
                        It is this part which has been reduced, consequently reducing the
                        effectiveness of the RFE job.</p>
                    <p>The total—public fund-raising plus the Government contribution—should change
                        direction upwards. For a couple of million dollars more, we could hold this
                        staff together and really do a job. It’s the most effective counter-Soviet
                        propaganda in Europe. But with increased labor costs and increased
                        production costs, if the budget remained the same, we would have to diminish
                        somewhat our activities. And when the budget declines, it hurts doubly.</p>

                    <p>The kind of aggressive, pragmatic, political intellectual that RFE employs is
                        ideally suited to plan and execute these counter-political and
                        counter-propaganda activities. Most of them are not dreamers, but are
                        sophisticated, experienced politicians who know how to come to grips with
                        this problem. I believe they should be encouraged with a little more
                        money.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, there is some dissension—as always in these activities—between the
                        “outs” and the “ins”. When they have these governments-in-exile and these
                        peoples in exile, they don’t always agree with the man who is hired by RFE,
                        and is doing the job. This carping criticism is especially true on the
                        Polish desk because very few Poles can agree on how we should approach the
                        Polish problem.</p>
                    <p>This is not an important difficulty, but just an example. My feeling is that
                        if <persName corresp="#p_RJJ_1">John Richardson</persName> is given full
                        support and a pretty free hand, he is the kind of director that can bring
                        these warring factions closer together.</p>

                        history is not a reassuring one. Shortly after the Second World War,
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BJF_1">Byrnes</persName> attempted
                        unsuccessfully to persuade <persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Walter
                            Lippmann</persName> to come into the Department to take charge of the
                        “battle to win men’s minds.” The growth of operating agencies (notably

                        supervising and coordinating this battle. President <persName

                    <p>To review these efforts raises questions that should not be glossed over now
                        that the need has once again been recognized. The successive failures to
                        reach a satisfactory administrative arrangement for coordinating
                        propaganda-political activities suggests there are limiting factors that
                        must be taken into account in any future arrangement.</p>
                    <p>IV. The following limitations, it seems to me, have not always been
                        recognized:</p>
                    <p>1. Propaganda-political warfare cannot be isolated and administered as a
                        separate part of the policy machinery of government. It must be integral to
                        policies and programs in the planning stage and in every stage of
                        implementation. To treat it separately runs two risks: By failing to take
                        proper account of U.S. policies, it may inadvertently do great damage; or,
                        more likely, by being ignored or overridden, it proves totally
                        ineffectual.</p>
                    <p>The problems of propaganda-political warfare raised by the Soviet action in
                        sealing off West (or East) Berlin illustrates this dilemma. It would have
                        been perfectly possible to stimulate strong public reaction in Berlin as
                        well as in East and West Germany. Citizen groups might have been induced to
                        tear down sections of the wall. Uprisings in East Germany could possibly
                        have been provoked. But such a free wheeling approach to
                        propaganda-political warfare would have clashed head on with U.S. policy
                        which was endeavoring to keep the German situation from flaring out of
                        control.</p>
                    <p>Failing this approach in Germany, propaganda-political warfare could achieve
                        only limited successes elsewhere. The United States lacks the disciplined
                        cadres available to the Soviets which are capable of being turned on and off
                        at a signal.</p>
                    <p><pb n="161" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_161"/>2. The basic nature of the
                        propaganda-political warfare between U.S. and U.S.S.R. results in an uneven
                        contest. The conduct of propaganda-political warfare by the U.S. is very
                        much limited by what we really mean to do. We lack the flexibility of the
                        Soviets. We hesitate to rouse false hopes or false fears among allies and
                        neutrals. Remembering the experience of Hungary, we are reluctant to stir
                        unrest and uprisings within the Soviet bloc for fear that we will be called
                        upon to go to the rescue. The Soviets, on the other hand, do not hesitate to
                        play on the free world’s every vulnerability. They summon their partisans to
                        acts of sabotage, terrorism and political uprising without moral obligation
                        to back them directly.</p>
                    <p>3. U.S. conduct is limited by its open communications system. The Soviets can
                        wage one type of political-propaganda campaign on one front and another on a
                        second. Their domestic audience hears a different story from their foreign
                        audience. There is almost sacrosanct communication within the official
                        apparatus of the Soviet system.</p>
                    <p>U.S. Government, on the other hand, must reckon with a press which serves as
                        a vigilant intelligence system whose loyalty is to a different set of values
                        than the propaganda-political warfare interests of the nation. “News” is a
                        commodity which can comprise the government’s deepest secrets—the press
                        alone serves as judge.</p>
                    <p>As a result, U.S. gambits in the propaganda-political warfare are frequently
                        checkmated by our own players. The decision to delay underground nuclear
                        testing after the Soviets had resumed was effectively neutralized by the
                        press’ explanation that the only reason for the delay was to “maximize”
                        opposition of world public opinion against the Soviets. (This explanation,
                        it should be added, was made freely available by the politicians in Congress
                        who have their own problems of propaganda-political warfare back home.)</p>
                    <p>4. Finally, the U.S. government is limited in the uses for which it can
                        mobilize non-governmental groups. Much has been freely advocated about
                        employing the resources of labor unions, businesses and others who have
                        dealings abroad. But these groups, by and large, are suspicious of attempts
                        to make them into official organs of propaganda and intrigue. Any large
                        scale effort at such recruitment, except on the most carefully defined
                        terms, is apt to be counter-productive.</p>
                    <p>V. Recognizing these limitations, the U.S. government still has urgent need
                        to integrate propaganda-political warfare more fully into the formulation
                        and conduct of foreign policy. The so-called “P factor” (<persName
                            corresp="#p_JCD_1">C.D. Jackson</persName>’s innovation) should be an
                        important item on the checklist of policy makers in every related activity
                        of government. This “extra dimension” to policy needs to be constantly
                        drummed into the consciousness of those who must execute policy in the
                        field.</p>
                    <p>The “P factor” must be rescued from the faint derision it often receives from
                        the diplomats and the military strategists. Its present <pb n="162"
                            facs="0199" xml:id="pg_162"/>importance could not be more obvious.
                        Policy makers, for example, could conceivably execute a faultless series of
                        diplomatic and military moves in defense of Berlin, only to lose the city
                        because of defeats in the propaganda-political warfare.</p>
                    <p>The basic strategy directives of propaganda-political warfare must emanate
                        from the top of government rather than emerge in harum-scarum fashion down
                        the line. These directives need to be few in number, simple and clear-cut in
                        expression. Ideally, they should be enunciated by the President himself
                        after deliberation in the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Once adopted, they should serve as general guidelines to U.S. officials in
                        Washington and abroad. Following these guidelines, the State Department
                        would regularly send out “talking papers” to our representatives abroad
                        which take account of the propaganda-political warfare factors in a current
                        situation. The guidelines should be broad enough to provide direction for
                        the various representatives and agents of the U.S. government abroad. They
                        should also be capable of adaptation to provide useful information to
                        private citizens and groups working abroad.</p>
                    <p>(See Appendix<note n="11" xml:id="d59fn11">Attached but not printed is the
                            4-page appendix.</note> for more specific suggestions).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendations:</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Appointment of a Special Assistant to the Secretary of State to
                        “coordinate and supervise” propaganda-political warfare is, I believe,
                        unfeasible and unwise. Administratively, he would cut across the statutory
                        authority vested in the Directors of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. He would have vague and
                        unsupported responsibility in areas of policy guidance now belonging to the
                        Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and the Director of the
                        Office of Intelligence Research. The field is already cluttered with
                        overlapping hegemonies. It would not be clarified by setting up still
                        another high-level “coordinator” who would have neither the staff nor the
                        necessary powers to do his job. The inter-departmental task force he is
                        supposed to head would not likely draw on sufficiently high ranking agency
                        representatives to be able to implement any agreements it might reach.</p>
                    <p>2. Quite apart from his contribution to administrative anarchy, such a
                        Special Assistant might prove actually harmful to the conduct of foreign
                        policy. Standing apart from the chain of command, he would be tempted to
                        justify his existence by peddling “gimmicks” for waging propaganda-political
                        warfare. Alternatively, he would grow reconciled to serving as the
                        whipping-boy for the government’s continued failure to deal with this
                        problem.</p>
                    <p><pb n="163" facs="0200" xml:id="pg_163"/>3. Better coordination of
                        propaganda-political warfare can only be achieved by a better working
                        relationship among those who are primarily charged with responsibility in
                        this area. It would be a mistake to return to the excessively formalistic
                        arrangements of the Psychological Strategy Board or the Operations
                        Coordinating Board. These groups became so enmeshed in formal agenda,
                        voluminous staff studies and rituals that they lacked the capacity to
                        respond to urgent needs. In their place I would suggest the formation of an
                        ad hoc working group chaired by the Deputy Under Secretary of State and
                        including the appropriate Assistant Secretaries of State and agency
                        representatives. For particular projects the acting chairmanship could be
                        delegated to one of the other members. An assistant to the Deputy Under
                        Secretary could act as expediter for this working group, serving not as a
                        senior official but only on the authority of his boss. The group’s value
                        would lie in the speed and flexibility of its working relations.</p>
                    <p>4. An improved flow of ideas about propaganda-political warfare might also
                        come from better use of already existing institutions within the Government.
                        These include in the State Department the Policy Planning Staff, the Policy
                        Guidance Staff in the Bureau of Public Affairs, and the Soviet Counter
                        Propaganda Committee now located in the Office of Intelligence Research.
                        There are similar groups already at work within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. No Special
                        Assistant, working alone, could hope to duplicate their potential for
                        creative thinking in this field.</p>
                    <p>5. Better ways should be devised to make certain that political-propaganda
                        problems do not get neglected at the very highest levels of government. The
                        Tuesday Lunch Group, which brings together the second-tier officials, should
                        keep the “P factor” more regularly under survey. Needless to add, it should
                        be a regular part of <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> deliberations.</p>
                    <p>I can only reiterate that the effort to “orchestrate” governmental activities
                        in propaganda-political warfare will succeed only when there are clear and
                        firm directives emanating from the top which are sustained by clear and firm
                        policies. It is not a matter of turning this business over to a medicine
                        man—or, for that matter, a beady-eyed Psychological warrior. It will take
                        the energy and insight of the President himself to accomplish anything
                        really significant.</p>

                            Association of America.</note> He was inclined to think I had
                        exaggerated the damage done by certain films when shown abroad.</p>
                    <p>It was suggested that the Agency assign an experienced officer to Hollywood
                        who would be available for consultation on script and story lines, to advise
                        regarding material or situations which might produce adverse reactions
                        abroad. We are giving consideration to this suggestion.</p>
                    <p>There was some casual conversation about the creation of a non-profit
                        corporation for the production and distribution of films designed to serve
                        the national interest. A number of stars volunteered to work for nothing and
                        it was felt that the unions and guilds might be prepared to cooperate by
                        working for minimum scale. I doubt that anything concrete will emerge from
                        this but we are attempting to nourish the idea quietly through a group of
                        the younger producers and writers. If there should be progress on this
                        project, you will be advised.</p>
                    <p>In due course, I shall propose a list of leaders of the film industry who
                        might usefully be invited to lunch at the White House.</p>

                    <p>I. <hi rend="italic">America wants peace, has made and is making every effort
                            to achieve it.</hi></p>
                    <p>Supporting points:</p>
                    <p>a. Memories of the horrors of World War II, and the President’s personal
                        knowledge of it,<note n="4" xml:id="d61fn4">The President served in the U.S.
                            Navy during World War II.</note> which we share with the Russians.</p>
                    <p>b. The U.S. did not attack Russia when we had sole possession of atomic
                        bombs.</p>
                    <p>c. We have sought earnestly and patiently for 16 years to bring about
                        realistic complete and total disarmament, and live in peace. We still stand
                        ready to sign a treaty banning nuclear tests,<note n="5" xml:id="d61fn5">See

                        points of which were already agreed to by the Soviet Union before it broke
                        the voluntary moratorium and resumed tests in the atmosphere this fall.<note

                    <p>d. Our military capacity is inherently a defensive, second-strike capacity.
                        We will never strike first, but if we are attacked our response will be
                        greater than the blow dealt us.</p>
                    <p>e. U.S. actions that may seem aggressive (e.g., U–2 flights, overseas bases)
                        are in fact defensive, dictated in large part by the closed society of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p><pb n="166" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_166"/>f. U.S. retreat on Berlin would
                        encourage aggression just as Munich did. This is a difficult point, but if
                        it can be conveyed, it will make the Russians ask themselves whether they
                        want to risk their skins for the hated German.</p>
                    <p>g. We appreciate the peaceful accomplishments of the Soviets in music,
                        sports, science, etc. and hope they can continue toward a better world for
                        all.</p>
                    <p>h. We appreciate the innate friendliness of the Russians for Americans, as
                        shown to tourists, for example, and would like to increase interchanges of
                        all kinds, including trade on a sound basis.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The issue is not capitalism versus socialism or
                            communism but free choice versus coercion.</hi></p>
                    <p>Supporting points:</p>
                    <p>a. The U.S. cooperates willingly with independent socialist states.</p>
                    <p>b. Capitalism as seen by orthodox Marxism does not exist today. The major
                        “capitalist” nations have, in fact, provided their people with the things
                        that Communism has so far only promised. (Experience with our exhibit guides
                        has demonstrated a profound Russian interest in health care, social security
                        and pensions, educational opportunities, wage levels, unemployment
                        compensation, etc.)</p>
                    <p>c. The most striking example is perhaps not our industrial production but our
                        tremendous agricultural success, giving us food resources to share not only
                        with our allies and non-aligned countries but such countries as Poland.</p>
                    <p>d. What matters most is our freedom, including the freedom to adopt whatever
                        economic system suits us best. We will preserve our freedom to travel (any
                        American can leave his country at will), our freedom of access to
                        information, our freedom to read, think, and act as we choose.</p>
                    <p>e. As for other countries, we desire only that they are able to work out
                        their own destinies in their own way, under whatever internal political and
                        economic system they choose. We are providing help to those who ask it in
                        the pursuit of these goals.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">We will fight if we must to preserve our freedom and
                            independence, and that of our allies.</hi></p>
                    <p>a. Our military capacity is so great that we are not impressed by threats to
                        bury us.</p>
                    <p>b. Nor can we stand by and see “salami” tactics used to swallow up free
                        people slice by slice. We do not fear to negotiate, but will do so only on a
                        truly give-and-take basis; we will not negotiate from fear.</p>
                    <p>c. The actions of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its allies
                        since World War II have reluctantly compelled us to strengthen our
                        conventional defensive arms, for the maintenance of our own freedom and that
                        of our allies.</p>

                        Communist ambitions. The Allies are united in their determination to

                    <p>Some 150 U.S. business firms responded to the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> suggestion that they distribute pamphlet material to their
                        representatives abroad. They requested some 3,000 copies of the State
                        Department pamphlet, “Background Berlin—1961”.</p>
                    <p>The Agency has been working with the Berlin city government which has
                        assisted the travel to Berlin of foreign leaders to see the situation for
                        themselves. More than 750 personalities and newsmen from 80 countries were
                        received in Berlin in the six weeks following August 13. A special
                        illustrated Berlin pamphlet, in picture-magazine format with dramatic
                        photographs, is being distributed abroad in some two million copies in 11

                        appear to be a strong possibility that destruction of food crops would be
                        interpreted largely as an effort to suppress a disaffected Viet-Nam

                        stirred up in Eastern Europe about the same time.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3"

                            picked up by some neutrals. You will recall that this was the case
                            during the Korean war although the Communist charges had no factual
                            basis whatever. “On the other hand, I am satisfied that successful
                            plant-killing operations in VietNam, carefully coordinated with and
                            incidental to larger operations, can be of substantial assistance in the

                        against Asians in Japan—tie us, in effect, to another “first” in

                    <p>I fear we would be deluding ourselves if we hope to escape blame for these
                        actions by having them carried out by Vietnamese planes and pilots. Leaflets
                        to loyal inhabitants of affected areas would be helpful locally, but would

                        put in a defensive position. I would hope our emphasis throughout could be
                        on what the insurgents are trying to do to Viet-Nam, keeping our tactics in
                        the perspective of necessary steps to combat a mortal threat to that

                        future plans for the Program.</p>
                    <p>Since it began, in July 1954, the International Cultural Presentations
                        Program has put before some 15 million people in almost every country in the
                        world for them to see for themselves an authentic part of life in the United
                        States. In this program, we have not made an argument or drawn a picture. We
                        have exported actual examples, more than two hundred of them, of American
                        excellence in the performing arts and sports. The performing groups—3/4 of
                        them in music, dance, and theatre, and 1/4 in sports—have been well received
                        abroad, nearly always with enthusiasm, appreciation, and respect, and not
                        infrequently, with openly expressed admiration. (Lists of the attractions
                        exported and where they have gone are attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2"

                        events.</note></p>
                    <p>Moreover, this program is effective everywhere. The Philadelphia Orchestra
                        dazzled Paris; <persName corresp="#p_AL_1">Louis Armstrong</persName>
                        conquered sub-Sahara Africa; the University of Michigan Band triumphed in
                        the Soviet Union. For the people of the western, economically advanced
                        nations, our cultural presentations are a reminder of a common cultural
                        inheritance, as well as a demonstration that we have respected and nurtured
                        that <pb n="175" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_175"/>inheritance, with consequent
                        strengthening of traditional ties. To the people of the new nations, our
                        cultural presentations demonstrate that in building our own nation we have
                        not confined our best efforts to material and technological advancement, as
                        many of them tend to believe. With the people of the Soviet bloc, to whom
                        other channels are few and narrow, they are a direct and persuasive
                        communication of shared devotion to cultural values transcending political
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>In comparison with our international economic and military programs, cultural
                        presentations are inexpensive; total costs have averaged about 2½ million
                        dollars a year. It is unlikely that cost for cost they can be matched by
                        many other programs in gaining prestige, respect, and good will for the
                        United States. More and better use of international cultural presentations
                        is called for as a matter of prudent allocation of the resources the nation
                        devotes to foreign relations.</p>
                    <p>Five immediate steps are contemplated to make the International Cultural
                        Presentations Program more effective:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Increase the scale</hi>. Doubling of the current 2½
                        million dollar budget is recommended for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                        1963, to be followed by 2½ million dollar annual increments until the scale
                        of operations is at least four times present dimensions.<note n="3"

                            parallel lines in the left-hand margin next to this sentence and drew an
                            arrow pointing to the lines. In his November 30 covering memorandum (see
                                <ref target="#d64fn1">footnote 1</ref>, above), <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_2">Bundy</persName> indicated that the Bureau of the
                            Budget had rejected <persName corresp="#p_CPH_1">Coombs</persName>’
                            request, as <persName corresp="#p_CPH_1">Coombs</persName> “has not yet
                            made a good case” for specific uses and had not “worked out effective
                            relations” with <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_2">Bundy</persName> recommended that the President
                            “hint to <persName corresp="#p_CPH_1">Coombs</persName> that if he could
                            get <persName corresp="#p_HF_1">Hamilton</persName>’s support for a
                            modest increase in his budget, you might approve it.” The President
                            neither approved nor disapproved either the budget increase or the
                            proposal that <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Administrator
                                <persName corresp="#p_HF_1">Hamilton</persName> review and support a
                            modest increase in the budget.</note> Far-reaching as the program has
                        been, it has been compelled, for lack of funds, to make the few greatest
                        cities in each country abroad its normal outlets. A vast audience, many
                        times greater than the audience reached thus far, remains untouched. Hence,
                        the recommended increase is amply justified for the reasons suggested above,
                        quite aside from the question of Soviet competition in this field. That the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is effectively carrying out a
                        worldwide program of cultural exports and on a scale far greater than ours,
                        however, is a special reason for stepping up our program.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Improve the quality</hi>. It is not suggested that the
                        performing artists and athletes who have gone abroad in this program up to
                        now have been inferior. On the contrary, they have been, by and large, the
                        best of their kind. The improved quality recommended here is of a different
                        order: it involves more attention to the types of audiences desired and to
                        the suitability of each performing group for those particular audiences. Up
                        to now the program has predominantly, but by no means <pb n="176"
                            facs="0213" xml:id="pg_176"/>uniformly, made the elite associated with
                        political power, wealth, and social standing its typical audience, and
                        performing groups suitable for this kind of audience have tended to
                        dominate. The following changes of emphasis, accepted as policies of the
                        program within recent months and already affecting its complexion, should
                        continue:</p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Give highest priority to youth, labor, and
                            intellectuals as target audiences.</hi></p>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Send out more attractions suited for these
                            audiences.</hi> To the fullest extent possible without relaxing
                        standards of performance, performing groups should be drawn from academic
                        and labor circles and from the ranks of young artists in the early stages of
                        their careers. Use of such performers in relatively small groups coupled
                        with more sparing use of the most expensive large groups such as the major
                        symphony orchestras (unless the costs are partially borne by non-government
                        sources) would, of course, permit any given amount of funds to go further in
                        reaching these special target audiences.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Strengthen the administrative organization and advisory
                            machinery</hi>. The following measures are required here:</p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Enlarge and reinforce the State Department staff
                            concerned with operations of the program</hi>. The unit of the Bureau of
                        Educational and Cultural Affairs which now has responsibility for operations
                        is made up of three professionals and five clerical or stenographic
                        employees. Augmentation of this staff with people experienced in production
                        or management in the performing arts is essential.</p>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Improve outside agency arrangements</hi>. The
                        Government’s major agent in the conduct of the program is the American
                        National Theatre and Academy (<gloss target="#t_ANTA_1">ANTA</gloss>).
                            <gloss target="#t_ANTA_1">ANTA</gloss> also maintains three specialized
                        expert panels to pass on the artistic competence of performers for the
                        program. Examination of both of these aspects of <gloss target="#t_ANTA_1"
                            >ANTA</gloss>’s role is under way to determine whether modifications
                        should be made.</p>
                    <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Strengthen United States cultural affairs offices
                            abroad</hi>. In the field, administrative responsibility for this
                        program falls upon the Cultural Affairs Officer, in most posts a <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer heading a one-man office heavily
                        burdened with other cultural activities. The need for more qualified
                        personnel in the cultural affairs staffs abroad is already acute. With
                        expansion of the program it will be imperative.</p>

                        called upon not only to advise the State Department and the <gloss

                        also, at the President’s discretion, to advise him on national and

                        sources of private help can be tapped to a sufficient extent to strengthen
                        the program significantly: (1) outstanding performing artists may offer
                        their services at nominal or no cost; and (2) individual and corporate
                        donors as well as foundations may contribute to the costs of sending large
                        performing groups abroad, thereby permitting more use of our more
                        spectacular attractions than would be possible under an exclusively

                    <p>While comparisons of opinions of Castro in the January and November surveys
                        show little change, many respondents when asked the direct question, felt
                        their opinion of him had dropped. Percentages of those who thought so were
                        18 per cent in Rio, 25 in Mexico City, 28 in Montevideo, 29 in Buenos Aires,
                        and 35 in Bogota. Between 5 and 6 per cent in all cities thought their
                        opinion of him had gone up.</p>
                    <p><pb n="180" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_180"/>Asked whether Castro’s government
                        sets a good example for their countries, majorities did not think so. The
                        percentages were 50 in Rio, 58 in Montevideo, 55 in Buenos Aires, and 74 in
                        Bogota. From 6 to 13 per cent favored his example.</p>
                    <p>While the overwhelming majority were opposed or indifferent to Castro, this
                        does not mean the general populace opposes radical social and economic
                        change. Previous surveys have shown that proposals to break up large estates
                        and to expropriate foreign (and even locally-owned) property have had more
                        appeal than the Castro symbolism.</p>
                    <p>Although not sold themselves on Castroism, 3 or 4 in 10 think Castro and
                        those who support him have substantial influence in Latin America. The
                        Fidelista movement, consequently, may benefit from this image of strength.
                        However, when asked the direct question, more people think his influence is
                        decreasing than think it is increasing. An exception is Bogota where 36 per
                        cent think his influence is growing in Latin America, 32 think it is
                        declining, 24 think it remains the same.</p>
                    <p>The effect of the policy of ignoring Castro was difficult to pin down
                        because, while the highest U.S. officials said less, the overall anti-Castro
                        barrage continued heavy.</p>
                    <p>Only a minority have the impression that high U.S. officials have been saying
                        less about Castro lately. Among the university-educated, however, there was
                        an awareness that high U.S. officials had been saying less about Castro,
                        since this elite group could distinguish between top-level U.S. statements
                        and the run of anti-Castro material.</p>
                    <p>Correlating the awareness and influence data suggests that top-level
                        reticence works more effectively with the sophisticated, whereas the general
                        population may react more effectively to a heavy flow of Castro
                        criticism.</p>

                        has brought us to serious concern at the inadequacies of U.S. press handling
                        at such international meetings. <persName corresp="#p_TRW_1">Roger
                            Tubby</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Arthur
                            Sylvester</persName> and I discussed the problems involved and I would
                        like to offer the following suggestions that we believe essential to a more
                        effective presentation of the U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>There is no way to prevent U.S. and foreign newsmen from learning by one
                        means or another what takes place at a multinational conference. To try to
                        conceal the main lines of ministerial discussion has persistently proved
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>Reporters must write. They will write what they get whether its source is
                        U.S. or foreign. If they get little, their speculation will compound public
                        confusion. If they get nothing from the U.S. side, they will parrot the line
                        of our conference partners.</p>
                    <p>U.S. acquiescence in ground rules that lead to “no background for the press”
                        has repeatedly resulted only in obfuscating the U.S. position but has never
                        hampered our treaty partners from quickly and clearly making known their
                        position.</p>
                    <p>We must assume a permanent posture that the press be informed, within
                        security limitations, of the U.S. position. We must not agree with our
                        allies to conceal the main lines of the proceedings because it is contrary
                        to our principle that the people have a right to know, because it results
                        only in confusion in press reporting, and because long experience has shown
                        that the U.S. is the only government to abide by such agreements. There will
                        be opposition to this posture from our allies; it is essential, however,
                        that we take a position of leadership in this respect as well as in that of
                        policy determination.</p>
                    <p>The mechanics of communicating the U.S. position are not complex. They
                        require:</p>
                    <p>That the principal U.S. briefing officer be present at all sessions even
                        though no subsequent briefing is to be made;</p>
                    <p><pb n="182" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_182"/>That <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> public affairs officers, who are intimately familiar with
                        the press of their countries, have opportunity for an adequate fill-in on a
                        continuing basis from the principal briefing officer;</p>
                    <p>That overnight intelligence be systematically collected (<gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers can provide précis of what the
                        other delegations are saying and how the press is reacting) and be evaluated
                        for presentation to the Secretary’s morning staff meeting;</p>
                    <p>And that background press briefings be held, occasionally before, but always
                        during and after such conferences by senior U.S. officers so that we can
                        seek to direct and nourish press coverage rather than try to correct
                        distortions afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Stepped-up Communist Chinese propaganda activities, especially in
                        newly-developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, have
                        heightened the need for information materials to counter these efforts.</p>

                            >USIS</gloss> Hong Kong is a unique and major source of factual,
                        corrective reporting on conditions in Communist China. The program was
                        initiated in 1956 to provide U.S. Missions, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> posts and foreign educational institutions, media and
                        government officials with credible, authoritative, readable material on the
                        policies, programs and methods of the Peiping regime.</p>
                    <p>Evidence is accumulating that <gloss target="#t_AFP_1">AFP</gloss> and
                        Reuters, the only major non-communist news agencies filing from Peiping, are
                        able to maintain their operations there only through observance of severe
                        restrictions on the type of material they file. This augments the importance
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> as a world source of accurate
                        material on Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The Agency calls the attention of the Post to the four basic types of output
                        comprising the <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> described below. While
                        many posts have been making effective use of some of this output, it is
                        requested that all posts review possibilities of using types of materials
                        not previously used. Costs of <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> materials
                        are borne by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong and not

                        of <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> materials as “handouts” but as
                        materials which should get into local circulation and use through whatever
                        channels would be most effective, e.g. direct mail from Hong Kong (Has the
                        post provided Hong Kong with all potentially useful addresses for direct
                        mail?); cooperation of other elements of the Country Team; distribution by

                        certain improvements in the present Agreement which do not necessarily
                        increase exchanges quantitatively but which do give us a better opportunity

                            >USSR</gloss>:</hi><note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">Reference is to an
                            illustrated monthly magazine published in Russian that depicted life in
                            the United States and a magazine published in English that chronicled
                            Soviet art, culture, science, and history.</note> It was agreed to
                        increase circulation from 50,000 to 100,000 per month on a gradual basis,
                        10,000 at a time. This will give us the opportunity to observe how the

                        four cities for periods of three to four weeks. As you know, this was a
                        major sticking point in the negotiations since the Soviets first did not
                        want to accept the themes we offered them, next did not want to have any
                        themes mentioned so as to delay concrete exhibit arrangements later and
                        finally even indicated that they would prefer not to have any exhibitions
                        exchanged at all.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Ed:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>You will recall that last August the President asked you and a number of
                        other officials to examine United States effectiveness in the field of
                        propaganda-political warfare.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d51fn2">footnote 2, Document 51</ref>.</note> On September
                        19, you and the other members of the Ad Hoc Committee agreed on a number of
                        recommendations in this field which were then approved by the
                            President.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">See <ref target="#d51">Document
                                51</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The key recommendations were: 1) that I appoint a Special Assistant for
                        Special Projects “to give full time to the coordination and overall
                        supervision of all United States resources in the propaganda-political
                        warfare field”, and 2) that I “call upon the other federal agencies with a
                        capability in this field to contribute a senior official to form an
                        inter-departmental task force to work under the Special Assistant”.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with these recommendations, I have placed this responsibility
                        in the Office of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MGC_2">George McGhee</persName>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JWJ_1">William J. Jorden</persName> has been appointed to
                        the post of special assistant to carry out this assignment in the field of
                        propaganda-political warfare. Since August 1961, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> has been a member of the
                        Department’s Policy Planning Council. Before that, he was a journalist and
                        foreign correspondent for The New York Times <pb n="191" facs="0228"
                            xml:id="pg_191"/>and served for many years in the Far East, in Moscow
                        and in Washington.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the second recommendation, I would appreciate your letting
                        me know the name of an official of your agency who may work with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> in laying out policy
                        lines and actions programs that will advance the United States’ cause in the
                        field of psychological-political warfare.</p>
                    <p>Any ideas or recommendations you may have in connection with this effort, now
                        or in the future, will be most welcome.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 7, 1962, pp. 761–763.</note> I
                        found that the Berlin Wall is the most effective argument against the
                        communist system. People in every part of the world recognize the Wall as an
                        admission of defeat by the communists.</p>
                    <p>This was made clear to me in Indonesia where I met, shortly before leaving,
                        with a group of 25 young people. One of their spokesmen had <pb n="192"
                            facs="0229" xml:id="pg_192"/>ready justification for Red China’s action
                        in Tibet, or Russian action in Hungary. But he had no ready answer to the
                        Wall.</p>
                    <p>“We don’t want to discuss these details,” was his response.</p>
                    <p>Not one of his colleagues questioned him, and looking at their faces I could
                        not discern even a trace of opposition to the colonialism of the Soviet
                        Union or of Communist China. This new modern form of colonialism clearly was
                        not something to be discussed.</p>
                    <p>Yet, after the meeting, four or five of the young people came to my room.
                        Their attitude was completely different. They admitted quite frankly that
                        they had not spoken up at the meeting because these subjects just never were
                        discussed in public. Quite clearly, they were completely intimidated by the
                        communists.</p>
                    <p>This was a most significant admission. Their reluctance to state their views
                        before their friends touches the core of our problem with students and
                        intellectuals abroad.</p>
                    <p>There is vocal opposition to the United States and to our way of life in
                        those foreign countries. Invariably, it is well organized. The communists
                        have their well-disciplined cadres. They have a party line which they follow
                        rigidly. They know exactly what they think. They know exactly what they are
                        for and what they are against. Usually, their leaders are energetic,
                        courageous, unyielding and articulate.</p>
                    <p>Very often they represent the minority of a student body or of a particular
                        organization. But they have fixed objectives. They know what they want. They
                        know where they are going. And they are willing to use any tools, any
                        devices, any means to obtain their ends.</p>
                    <p>Against this, as was the case at my meeting in Indonesia, there is usually no
                        one to raise questions against their party line. There is no organization,
                        no cadres, no disciplined calculated effort to give another side.</p>
                    <p>And so it is that under circumstances such as these, a small, able,
                        well-trained unit can take over a meeting or an organization ten times its
                        size in numbers. As we have seen over the course of history, such a minority
                        can even seize control of a government or a country.</p>
                    <p>It is apparent—in Indonesia, in Japan and elsewhere—that the communists have
                        created the impression, not only in Asia but across the world, that the
                        young intellectual is for communism and against our form of democratic
                        society.</p>
                    <p>The majority in fact is neither communist nor pro-communist. True enough,
                        they are not pro-United States. They have serious questions about our
                        country and our way of life. They frequently don’t understand us. But with
                        all of that, there is a tremendous reservoir of good will toward America and
                        the American people.</p>
                    <p>This is a reservoir which has not been tapped. To do so in the future, I
                        respectfully submit the following suggestions:</p>
                    <p><pb n="193" facs="0230" xml:id="pg_193"/>1. To all of these nations, we
                        should send groups of men and women to lecture—not just about the United
                        States and our form of government, or even about democracy generally—but to
                        talk also about history and philosophy and literature and even other more
                        practical matters. Also most importantly, these individuals should go to
                        learn, to listen and ultimately to report to the American people on the
                        aims, aspirations, objectives and problems of the people with whom they
                        meet. These individuals should make tours of as many universities as
                        possible, as well as having conferences with labor leaders, farm and
                        cooperative leaders and government officials. The people who would be sent
                        would have to know the history of the United States, the philosophy of our
                        government and understand the American people.</p>

                            corresp="#p_FOL_1">Orville Freeman</persName>—many members of the House
                        of Representatives, of our state governments, such as Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_EJH_1">Edmondson</persName> of Oklahoma or Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Sanford</persName> of North Carolina. I
                        would like to see some of our university professors; some of our authors,
                        playwrights, and poets travel for this purpose. I would like to see a man
                        such as <persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Walter Lippmann</persName> go through
                        the countries of the Far East for a month and speak on a number of subjects
                        and answer the questions of students and intellectuals. I believe such an
                        organized program would bring untold dividends.</p>
                    <p>2. Our government information agencies and services should do more to explain
                        the fundamentals of the United States. I would have them get across what
                        steps in social progress are being made in this country, what people are
                        doing for one another, what contributions charitable organizations are
                        making to the American way of life; what role the Ford Foundation, the
                        Carnegie Foundation, the <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rockefeller</persName>
                        Foundation play. I would have them speak quite frankly and openly about the
                        problems and difficulties we have within our country and also the efforts
                        being made by the government and the American people to deal with them.</p>
                    <p>3. Other free countries of the world should be encouraged to set up their own
                        “peace corps” with the understanding that our organization would cooperate
                        closely with them. There is much, for instance, that young Japanese could do
                        in Southeast Asia. I am convinced that they would be willing to do it. Many
                        of the young people in Germany, France and Holland are as anxious as young
                        Americans to help their fellowman in countries less fortunate economically.
                        I found among all the students with whom I talked an idealism and a thirst
                        to make the world a better place in which to live. This is a tremendous
                        potential and it must be harnessed and utilized.</p>
                    <p>We have many things going for us. Above all, we have truth on our side. As in
                        the case of the Wall, there can be no effective propagandized <pb n="194"
                            facs="0231" xml:id="pg_194"/>answer to the truth—if it is known. This is
                        just an outline—I would be glad to discuss these matters in greater
                        detail.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary greeted Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName>
                        and the members of the Commission in the Diplomatic reception room. After a
                        word of welcome he commented briefly on the important role international
                        cultural and educational exchanges play in the foreign policy of the
                        American people. He expressed his appreciation for the willingness of the
                        members to serve on the Commission.</p>
                    <p>He referred to the work of the Commission and said “we want you to know that
                        if there is anything at all we can do to support, encourage and stimulate
                        your work, we shall be glad to do it . . . this Commission’s advice,
                        encouragement and criticism are all needed in our work . . . we know there
                        is always room for great improvement and we are searching for those
                        improvements.”</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Wayne Hays</persName> remarked that
                        he was “happy and proud that the President had selected the type of people
                        he has on this <pb n="195" facs="0232" xml:id="pg_195"/>Commission” and
                        expressed his opinion that educational and cultural exchange programs have
                        great possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> thanked the
                        Secretary and Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> for
                        their friendly words of welcome. On behalf of the Commission he said the
                        members were “serving because of their deep conviction that this is an
                        important job.” He pointed out that their usefulness depended on two
                        factors—(1) “the seriousness of the Commission members,” and (2) “whether
                        the organization will know how to use us—Until proven otherwise, I will
                        accept the notion that they have the wisdom to do so.” (See Attachment

                        Commission’s concern over the lack of an executive order, and the lack of
                        one locus in Government for co-ordination of educational and cultural
                        programs. The President agreed that the executive order should be issued
                        soon, and went on to encourage the Commission to feel free to advise him and
                        the Congress on any subject considered by the members as important. He
                        solicited views from Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"

                        would not engage in “waltzing around” as had previous Commissions. This
                        comment led to general agreement that the Commission’s work would not be
                        futile by any means if the Department and the President asked it to engage

                        “ . . . this whole field [international educational and cultural relations]
                        is urgently in need of imaginative policy development, unification and
                        vigorous direction. These activities are presently scattered among many
                        agencies of the Federal Government. Only by centering responsibility for
                        leadership and direction at an appropriate place in the governmental
                        structure can we hope to achieve the required results. I shall therefore
                        look to the Secretary of State to exercise primary responsibility for policy

                    <p>“That the Commission feels that its effectiveness, as well as that of the

                        unification and vigorous direction, and until such time as this is done the
                        work of the Commission will be arid;</p>
                    <p>“That the Commission believes the central point in Government for
                        coordination of these activities is clearly the Department of State;</p>
                    <p>“That the Commission is somewhat surprised that, in the year since the
                        President had publicly declared that this was in fact the policy, this has
                        not been implemented by an Executive Order;</p>

                    <p>During the afternoon session, following the meeting with the President, the
                        following amendment to the above Resolution was unanimously adopted:</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You may be interested in two examples of gradual increase in our information
                        activities in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>First, as you know we started a Cultural Bulletin one and one-half years ago
                        without express permission of Soviet authorities. Circulation was two
                        hundred for the first three months and then was upped to two thousand in one
                        fell swoop. Soviet authorities did not object, partly because, we assume,
                        they do considerable mailing from their Embassy here and know that they
                        would not be permitted to continue their propaganda mailings if they stopped
                        us in Moscow. Recently circulation was increased to three thousand five
                        hundred. The Embassy informs us now that circulation will be increased by
                        adding the names of five hundred writers to the mailing list, bringing the
                        total to four thousand with further expansion contemplated. The addition of
                        two <pb n="199" facs="0236" xml:id="pg_199"/>local employees, recently
                        authorized, will permit expansion of this program as well as the quick
                        translation and timely mailing of Embassy press releases containing
                        important Administration statements to upward of two thousand addressees.
                        (The Cultural Bulletin, incidentally, is prepared by our Special Projects
                        Office in Vienna from raw materials provided by <gloss target="#t_IPS_1"
                            >IPS</gloss> here. A copy of the Cultural Bulletin is attached.)<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">Not attached.</note></p>
                    <p>Second, recent expansion of the physical facilities of the Embassy in Moscow
                        has enabled us to construct a Consular Reception Room and a reading room
                        both of which will contain displays of books and periodicals available to
                        visitors for reading on the premises and, in some cases, for presentation.
                        You may know that the Embassy has carried out a discreet presentation
                        program of books and other publications for the last four years. These
                        presentations, ranging in volume up to fifteen hundred books and many more
                        related materials (periodicals, records, sheet music, pamphlets, etc.) per
                        year, are normally distributed to Soviet citizens through tourists, exchange
                        delegations and individuals, students and others on official or unofficial
                        visits in the Soviet Union. Materials are, of course, non-political in
                        content. We hope to be able to expand this program gradually.</p>
                    <p>In both of these cases I believe that continuation of the programs and their
                        success depends partly on our keeping quiet about them and not publicizing
                        in this country the efforts we are making to pierce the Iron Curtain.</p>

                        possibilities in both the Soviet Union and the satellites is realistic;
                        there is specifically no expectation of nor notion of encouraging revolt or

                        and the approaches suitably differentiated. Reliability is established as a
                        prime criterion for both organizations. The difference between official
                        outlets like the Voice of America and these outlets is clearly spelled

                        clear, and, to the extent I can evaluate it, conforms to national policy.
                        Policy on general stories tends to resemble our own, but there is a good
                        deal of specialized guidance covering events within, or of particular
                        interest to, a given country.</p>

                        particularly when read through back-translation. It is temperate in

                        when they get down to demonological affairs, but on the whole the
                        commentaries are sober and non-polemical in tone. Obviously, to carry out
                        their mission, both outlets need to deal in some unpalatable stuff. In two
                        or three instances the commentaries got polemical: Radio Liberty on the

                            War between Finland and the Soviet Union, 1939–1940.</note> “Stalin
                        began one of the dirtiest wars in history,” and Radio Free Europe to Poland
                        on new land taxes, “this party which is supposed not to talk in vain, will
                        never learn anything.” These are exceptions to the general rule, but
                        nevertheless appear to violate the basic policy proscriptions.</p>

                        juncture of history is another question. Radio Free Europe has been moving
                        more and more in the direction of “Europeanization”. Its extensive coverage
                        of Western European economic affairs and progress toward economic
                        integration has been precisely right.</p>

                        that it is supported by contributions from the public. It appears that the

                        Our principal problems are distribution and expert personnel. (We have just
                        sent six trained book officers to the area.) Money could become a problem as
                        our capability for effectively marketing books increases, but <gloss

                        Incidentally, we are pushing this theme hard in other media, particularly

                        titles. Distribution outside urban areas and between countries is severely
                        limited by lack of swift, sure communications, by exchange barriers and by
                        lack of credit. Some copies of each <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"

                        with houses primarily concerned with periodical publication and
                        continent-wide distribution. One such arrangement has been made in Mexico
                        with Novaro.</p>

                    <p>Soviet publications are frequently distributed through their own Embassies or
                        local Communist parties. One hundred diplomatic pouches containing printed

                        $654,000 or more than our total Latin American book budget this fiscal year.
                        Local Communist groups own or control bookstores in many Latin American
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>It has taken us a year to gear up an improved book program in the area after
                        years of neglect. We expect to move ahead rapidly now, and are giving it
                        highest priority.</p>

                    <p>Receptivity to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media output is nearly
                        always greater when the output is not attributed to the Agency or the U.S.
                        Government. I have therefore instructed our field posts not to carry <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> attribution on pamphlets, motion
                        pictures, television shows and other media products (but excluding
                        periodicals) except when local custom or law dictates otherwise. This rule
                        henceforth shall also apply to media materials produced in Washington.</p>
                    <p>The posts were asked to consider attribution to credible local groups when
                        appropriate and feasible. In Washington, you should consider attribution to
                        appropriate U.S. groups, when feasible and useful, in the production of
                        media materials.</p>
                    <p>An exception to this rule would be those instances when we want to make it
                        clear that we are presenting the official viewpoint of the U.S.
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>We must continue to distinguish between “unattributed” and “unattributable.”
                        Our materials may be “unattributed” but never “unattributable.” We are
                        willing to acknowledge, if questioned, the origin of any Agency product. My
                        point is that we should not publicize, emphasize or otherwise call attention
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-origin of our output except
                        when necessary. Our job is not to advertise the Agency or any element

                    <p>The President and I have recently discussed the importance of youth in world
                        affairs. The recent experience of the Attorney General in discussions with
                        students in Japan and Indonesia,<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> developments in Japan,
                        Korea, Turkey and Latin America plus other indications confirm belief that
                        the phenomenon of youth unrest is worldwide and a serious obstacle to
                        achievement of U.S. objectives. Politically-conscious students, particularly
                        in the underdeveloped nations, have a distorted, obsolete, often
                        Marxist-oriented view of the American economic system, our ideals and our
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>We feel that a greater and more effective effort in the youth and student
                        field must be made if we are to be successful in our total mission. We are
                        well aware that much is being done within the Government by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, by Departmental exchange programs, by
                        the Peace Corps and by others. A good deal is also being done by private
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>We are also aware that this is a subject of great sensitivity; obvious U.S.
                        Government efforts to manipulate youth abroad or at home would only multiply
                        our problems, not solve them. You, of course, can best determine how to
                        avoid pitfalls in your local situation. But there is much which is feasible
                        and prudent which should be done, and is not now being done. This will
                        require the forceful and resourceful leadership and personal attention of
                        our Chiefs of Mission abroad and our senior colleagues and ourselves in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>We have undertaken an interdepartmental study in Washington to determine what
                        is being done, what should be done, and what additional mechanisms—if
                        any—will be required. We will keep you informed of what develops.</p>
                    <p>The job in the field is largely one of public relations, and the operating
                        responsibility continues to be chiefly with <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss>. But we want you personally to interest yourself in this
                        effort. This message will be <pb n="207" facs="0244" xml:id="pg_207"
                        />followed by others spelling out techniques and activities which have
                        proven successful.</p>
                    <p>Some activities are obvious, however, and require no further explanation. For
                        example you and other key mission officers (particularly those with a
                        special flair for dealing with youth and a broad understanding of America’s
                        rapid progress in social welfare) might find it profitable to include youth
                        and student leaders in your representational activities. You may wish to
                        hold “open house” at the residence for leaders and teachers, or otherwise
                        stimulate direct confrontation with these young people in order to set right
                        their misconceptions. Lectures on the evils of Communism generally are not
                        useful. More to the point are intelligent, honest, dispassionate
                        explanations of what the United States is today, its goals and how they
                        coincide with those of youth elsewhere, its deep interest in the legitimate
                        aspirations of youth in other lands for a better future, and its desire to
                        help them to realize them in freedom.</p>
                    <p>In this effort there is no substitute for personal contact on a sustained
                        basis. We ask your personal attention and leadership, without which this
                        effort cannot succeed.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SITUATION</p>
                    <p>We want to increase attention to youth and student audiences. In the past our
                        media and posts have directed many of their activities at young people.
                        Increased attention to this audience is necessary because of (1) the
                        political role of young people in some countries and their role as pressure
                        groups in others, (2) the inroads of communist propaganda and (3) the
                        importance of young people as future leaders.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">TREATMENT</p>
                    <p>We want to show that:</p>
                    <p>(1) Efforts of non-communist youth movements can be more effective in support
                        of political, economic and social progress than the demagogic appeals of the
                        communists.</p>
                    <p>(2) The U.S. favors international youth cooperation but opposes the
                        exploitation of young people in the interests of the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>(3) The U.S. neither controls nor seeks to control the political orientation
                        or activities of youth movements.</p>
                    <p>(4) The U.S. favors constructive youth cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Where communist fronts have an impact among young people, we discreetly
                        expose them and discourage participation.</p>
                    <p>The media will report on international youth events. You should file suitable
                        material to <gloss target="#t_USINFO_1">USINFO</gloss> for
                        cross-reporting.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">CAUTIONS</p>
                    <p>(1) Some non-communist international youth movements have political or
                        denominational affiliations (e.g., International Union of Socialist Youth,
                            <gloss target="#t_PaxRomana_1">Pax Romana</gloss>/Catholic/). Such
                        affiliations are evidence <pb n="210" facs="0247" xml:id="pg_210"/>of the
                        variety in a world of free choice. In coverage, we emphasize their
                        activities rather than their affiliations.</p>
                    <p>(2) Many non-communist youth leaders are sensitive to government interference
                        in, or support for, their organizations. They do not wish to be identified
                        as “Western” or “anti-communist,” lest such a label strengthen communist
                        counterefforts or lead to internal dissension. We should be responsive to
                        these sensitivities and avoid the impression that we view a particular event
                        or organization as our instrument.</p>
                    <p>(3) In some countries, conditions may make it desirable to avoid (a) an open
                        anti-communist stand and/or (b) attribution to the U.S. Here it may be well
                        to emphasize what the U.S. is <hi rend="italic">for</hi>, citing U.S.
                        international youth activities, and to suggest alternatives to
                        communist-controlled youth movements.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <p>Important in the communist effort among young people are the varied
                        activities of the international youth front organizations. This year
                        communist efforts will climax in the 8th World Youth Festival in Helsinki
                        (July 27–August 5), the 6th Assembly of the World Federation of Democratic
                        Youth in Warsaw (<gloss target="#t_WFDY_1">WFDY</gloss>) (August 10–16) and
                        the 7th Congress of the International Union of Students (<gloss
                            target="#t_IUS_1">IUS</gloss>) (August 18–27) in Leningrad. The latter
                        two events will be on a smaller scale than the Helsinki Festival and are
                        expected to be more political and organizational in character.</p>
                    <p>Many bona-fide non-communist international youth organizations are also
                        holding major meetings during the coming months. They include:</p>

                        against communist youth fronts and communist penetration efforts among young
                        people.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> General Approach</p>
                    <p>1. The basic policy to be followed in the public handling of the Sino-Soviet
                        dispute is to treat it as a major international development which is worthy
                        of important emphasis and close attention, and about which the American and
                        other peoples should be fully informed.</p>
                    <p>2. Constant care is to be taken, however, to avoid exaggerating either the
                        nature or implications of the dispute. In particular, statements <pb n="212"
                            facs="0249" xml:id="pg_212"/>and interpretations are to be avoided that
                        suggest that: (a) the dispute has resulted in, or is likely to result in, a
                        change in basic Communist objectives toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> and the Free World, (b) the dispute has affected the
                        capability of either the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or Communist
                        China to endanger the security of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>,
                        (c) the dispute has eliminated or reduced pressures that the Communist
                        powers are bringing to bear on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests
                        in various critical areas of the world, (d) the dispute has mitigated the
                        urgency of the need for proceeding with the strengthening of the free world
                        community.</p>
                    <p>3. Strictest regard to accuracy shall be observed in the dissemination of
                        attributable information about the dispute.</p>
                    <p>4. Any suggestion that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is taking sides
                        in the dispute is to be avoided. Similarly, there should be no suggestion
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> intends, or is willing, to
                        manipulate its policies in the interest of furthering the dispute.</p>

                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName>:</p>
                    <p>After calling the meeting to order, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1"
                            >Gardner</persName> called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1"
                            >Battle</persName> who was scheduled to discuss his recently assumed
                        responsibilities as Assistant Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> opened his remarks by
                        expressing his appreciation for having, he thought, one of the best
                        qualified groups available to assist him and the Government in increasing
                        the effectiveness of this country’s educational and cultural exchange
                        programs. In commenting on the significance of this new assignment, he
                        stated in part—“I am very eager to take on this job . . . it combines my two
                        careers and most of my hobbies . . . I have had many years in the Department
                        of State in the field of foreign policy and quite a few years outside in the
                        educational-foundation world, so to merge the two, and along with other
                        things that I have done, it is a particularly pleasant prospect.”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d84fn2"><persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> joined
                            the Department of State in the 1940s and served on the Canada Desk
                            before serving as a special assistant to <persName corresp="#p_ADG_1"
                                >Acheson</persName> and as First Secretary and Chief of the
                            Political Section of the Embassy in Copenhagen. He left the Department
                            of State to serve as Vice President of Colonial Williamsburg and then
                            returned to the Department in 1961.</note></p>
                    <p>He then expressed his desire to be absolutely candid and straightforward with
                        the members and to feel free to share with the Commission his problems of
                        which he has a great many.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> then pointed out that in
                        taking on a new job individuals are bound to approach it in slightly
                        different ways in order to fit their own mode of operation but this doesn’t
                        mean one is right or one wrong. He added that he has several fairly clear
                        ideas of what he believes should be done. He then spoke of one in
                        particular—the philosophy <pb n="214" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_214"/>of the
                        operation itself. He then pointed out that the emphasis in the past has been
                        to try to separate the operations of the office of Assistant Secretary—to
                        keep two sort of separate entities. This, in his opinion is something he
                        could not work with. He feels that the Assistant Secretary in charge of the
                        program is responsible for the operation—that in the opinion of most people
                        anything that goes right or wrong with the specific, detailed operation of
                        the Department’s program is his responsibility and, therefore, he must
                        accept that responsibility. Thus, the first step he has taken is to make Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAV_1">Boerner</persName> his Deputy, thereby
                        placing the full responsibility for the operations in the Assistant
                        Secretary’s office. Yet, he said, this still leaves much to be desired.</p>
                    <p>Over a great many years new programs have been added, either by Congress or
                        other initiative and pocket units have been set up to take care of
                        particular situations. The focus of the Department of State has always been
                        around the geographic area. These geographic bureaus in the Department still
                        have a very key role. Many other agencies of Government are organized on a
                        geographic basis. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has been the
                        exception and although the Department is supposed to be doing the
                        coordinating it has not been geared to coordinate. To organize <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> on a geographic basis is going to be very
                        upsetting for a time and it cannot be started immediately. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CPH_1">Coombs</persName> had come to the same conclusion and
                        had started a great many plans for the geographic organization. The planning
                        that was done while he was here will be of enormous help in going into this
                        shift.</p>
                    <p>As to the important and complicated subject of coordination, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> stated that from his own experience
                        in Government, coordination really has to be done at two levels—first, as to
                        day-to-day knowledge and exchange in an operating way of what goes on; and
                        second, on a policy level—the first forms the basis for the second. He cited
                        his early experience in the Department as a desk officer for Canada at which
                        time a series of meetings were held every month or six weeks pulling
                        together the people who worked on Canada in various Government agencies.
                        There was no agenda, no decisions—just a review on a regular basis of what
                        had recently happened in Canada and what each individual had pending that
                        affected Canada. This afforded a simple mechanism for exchanging problems
                        with which each agency was faced with respect to Canada and led to the
                        planning and development of a unified position whereby all agencies would
                        not be moving in at the same time to try to get something from the
                        Canadians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> thought this
                        sort of a device will be a starting point for the coordination that is
                        absolutely essential to the conduct of the <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> program. Thus if the Bureau is organized on a geographic
                        basis it will provide a focal point <pb n="215" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_215"
                        />whereby <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> personnel working in a specific
                        area can get in touch with their counterpart in each of the several
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>Then, he added, you have the level of policy which he believes is his
                        responsibility, with due regard to his superiors, the Commission, and
                        others. This has to be achieved in several ways—the first and very basic
                        part is “good will” and in this connection he has been calling on people in
                        other agencies, having them over for lunch and discussing their respective
                        programs. He believes the above two mechanisms form the basis for a chance
                        at coordinating a very complicated structure.</p>
                    <p>He then expressed the view that we have got to find some way to relate what
                        we do, and what the foundations do, to what we are trying to achieve and
                        what our aims and goals are in this country. We cannot simply operate
                        independently. It is his hope that when the Bureau is organized on a
                        geographic basis that the individuals working on a country desk or an area
                        desk will keep close tab on what is happening in the foundations and
                        Government which will form some sort of basis for decision-making, and bring
                        about a better coordination of programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> briefly commented on the
                        personnel situation in the Bureau calling particular attention to the people
                        who are to head up the geographic areas. He believes they are competent and
                        experienced and will form an excellent nucleus around which to build this
                        structure. He also informed the Commission that he had been assured of space
                        in the new building for at least all of the key offices of <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In closing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> stated “. . .
                        It is my hope that instead of offering you papers of final recommendations .
                        . . that I hand you problems . . . and hand you these problems at early
                        stages, rather than late stages, and get your thoughts and help on them. I
                        think that in this group the program has one of its greatest assets. I hope
                        you will permit me to use it in the way I am speaking of, or modified as you
                        would want it, but to make it a group with which I can freely and openly
                        talk about some of the difficulties I have. . . .”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> thanked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> for his remarks and stated “I think
                        I speak for every member of the Commission when I say that we are impressed
                        with the very open, straightforward, constructive view you have taken of our
                        work. And I will say that I personally have been very deeply impressed with
                        the energy that you have brought to this job and with the command you have
                        already gained of these difficult problems that you have mentioned.</p>

                        MURROW, DIRECTOR OF UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the Commission, the Chairman extended a warm welcome to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> who had been invited to
                        meet with the Commission. In calling on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1"
                            >Murrow</persName>, he stated that the Commission would be delighted to
                        hear about his own activities and what he expected of this Commission. He
                        pointed out that this Commission is a fairly new group. Although each member
                        has a very deep familiarity with one or another part of the whole program,
                        all of them are now becoming familiar with the bewildering variety of
                        agencies, projects, programs, and rivalries. He expressed the view that it
                        would be most helpful to the Commission if he had any words of wisdom about
                        its relationship to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and if he had any
                        worries or problems on which he would like their advice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> opened his remarks by
                        stating: “You mentioned two words: rivalries and worries. I can deal with
                        the first one in short order by saying that Luke<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3"
                                ><persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName>.</note> and I have
                        an agreement—that since there is bound to be a degree of confusion in
                        Washington (it is built-in), we are not going to export said confusion—we
                        will deal with it here. ’Worries’. This would take the rest of the
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>“I am not aware of any important friction between the Agency and this
                        particular area of State. I am aware of some inadequacy on both sides. I am
                        not sure that the counseling or selection of students brought here is
                        adequate. I am not sure that our cultural officers are of as high a caliber
                        as they should be. These are all things on which we are working. But I would
                        not be able to come here and register a series of complaints, or even a
                        major one.”</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName> remarked:
                        “Ed, I made some fairly sweeping commitments on your behalf and mine this
                        morning in an off the record session here about the new degree of our
                        cooperation. I pointed to the great help you had been in clearing up some of
                        the nasty little details of the Executive Order<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4"

                        had.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> replied: “I agree with
                        everything you said. We both face the problem of keeping our bureaucrats in
                        line, but I think we can do it.”</p>
                    <p>In reply to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName>’s question as
                        to this Commission’s relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s Advisory Commission on Information, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> stated: “The Advisory Commission on
                        Information is becoming a fairly active Commission, which we welcome. I
                        gather from the language of the <persName corresp="#p_HW_1"
                        >Hays</persName>-Fulbright Act that this Commission is also entitled and
                        empowered to advise us. This, also, will be welcomed. And I would think,
                        particularly, to give us advice (if the opportunity affords) based on
                        firsthand observation and knowledge. Because I become increasingly convinced
                        that, aside from certain policy ideas, our major problem consists of getting
                        the right man in the right place. And when we do that, the operation
                        functions; and, when we don’t, whatever the directives or guidelines, it
                        doesn’t function.</p>
                    <p>“And I would think that at some point you, or certain members of this
                        Commission, would want to sit down with our Commission and exchange views
                        and impressions.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> stated that he would
                        initiate correspondence with the Chairman of the Information Commission, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJL_1">J. Leonard Reinsch</persName>, that would
                        lead to an exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>The question was raised by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JCE_1"
                            >Johnson</persName> as to the advisability of having a writer in
                        residence, or an artist, depending on the country, who is freed from the
                        detailed work with which the cultural officer is involved. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> stated “it is conceivable and this
                        question has been discussed at great length over the past year. One time
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK_1">Galbraith</persName> wanted such an
                        officer in Delhi. After a few months’ experience, he changed his mind
                        entirely. However, I personally would like to see this done.”</p>
                    <p>As to the role that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can play in
                        promoting a point of view which might be conducive to more careful selection
                        and financing of African students coming to this country, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> stated that he did not have a quite
                        orthodox view of the matter of African students coming to this country,
                        having had a little experience in this area for thirty years. He thinks that
                        there are too many coming here and that they are not sufficiently well
                        chosen. He would like to see more Government money spent in developing
                        technical training institutions and vocational schools in the African
                        countries. And, to a large extent, this would apply to universities as
                        well.</p>

                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> would evaluate the effectiveness of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1"
                            >Murrow</persName> stated that he would have to break it down by
                        categories. He went on to say: “The wireless file we operate, which covers
                        10,000 words a day to five geographic areas by radio teletype, has improved
                        only because it is less bloated than it was. There is still too much of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>“The Voice of America is less important than the local placements we make
                        through tapes and packaged programs on medium-wave transmitters.</p>
                    <p>“There are a lot of misconceptions about this Agency. I had some; I probably
                        still have some.</p>
                    <p>“The libraries abroad have too few books of the language of the country in
                        which they are located. In short, too many English books in French-speaking
                        countries—that sort of thing.</p>
                    <p>“The bi-national centers in many cases have become rather the equivalent of
                        the English-Speaking Union, if I can say that without offense. They are
                        engaged in talking with people who are already converted.</p>
                    <p>“There is not enough give and take. They don’t make enough effort to get in
                        left-wing students, and so forth; and break a little intellectual furniture
                        inside as well as having windows broken—that sort of thing.</p>
                    <p>“The exhibits program: we have had three in the Soviet Union this year—one
                        dealing with plastics; one with transportation; one with medicine,<note

                        analysis of the questions asked by the Russian visitors. We will have had
                        about a million and a quarter through those three exhibits by the first of
                        July. The type of questioning reflects a great curiosity, ranging far beyond
                        the subject matter of the exhibits.”</p>
                    <p>In response to questions raised by the Chairman as to what he considered as
                        weak spots in the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> stated that obviously the process
                        of selection was first; second, the provision of an adequate and intensive
                        training course in English; and third, the problem of adequate follow-up for
                        the returned grantee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAV_1">Boerner</persName> stated, as a recent
                        returnee from the field: “I think that it is important for all of you to
                        remember that out at the operating level there is no program other than the
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> program that Ed runs for his own
                        organization, and for us too. So that everything we do is intimately
                        connected with Ed’s interests, and his organizational activities.</p>
                    <p>“And it seems to me, Ed, that the work of this Commission is something that
                        you and your people ought to be completely aware of, and could be brought in
                        on at all times, and manifest your interest. Take as simple a thing as this
                        study which the Commission is making—I mean it is not a simple thing, but
                        the idea is simple. You immediately get into the problem of what the local
                        post thinks about what should be said in the questionnaires; and the local
                        post is <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Now we have cultural
                        officers there; they are on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> payroll,
                        and the choices of the cultural officers are made essentially within <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. So we are intimately connected all the
                        way through. If your people go out in the field to talk to our people, the
                        people who are running our program, you are going to talk to <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers when you arrive . . .”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> referred to his earlier
                        statement about getting this Commission’s advice by “first-hand reports from
                        the field.” It was his opinion that the Commission’s surveys would cover two
                        parts: (1) whether the planning and the concept here in Washington by
                        Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Battle</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BAV_1">Boerner</persName>, and Company is adequate and
                        tailored to the need; and (2) whether the actual execution in the field is
                        being properly done which is <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FLH_1">Foster</persName> raised the point that the
                        stereotype of America which is in the minds of many people in other
                        countries is an unfavorable one. They think of us as a materialistic
                        society, as not hard-working sometimes, and they do not have a good or
                        favorable impression of our cultural development. Much of this impression,
                        he believes, they gain through the fruits of our commercial enterprises
                        abroad. He wondered to what extent the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> program deals with counteracting this point of view.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> replied: “It is a problem
                        and it is not soluble because the sum total of what we do abroad represents
                        very little in the total spectrum of communication.</p>
                    <p><pb n="220" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_220"/>“There are, for example, 35,000
                        missionaries abroad spending about four times our total budget. There are a
                        million military personnel and dependents. Television alone is now exporting
                        between $40 and 50 million worth of product from this country. We are in the
                        television business; we are in the movie business. But the impact of our
                        output, compared to the networks, the syndicators, and the Hollywood export,
                        is nothing—I mean it is a tiny fragment.</p>
                    <p>“I have done a little arguing with the people in Hollywood and in the
                        networks in an effort to persuade them to have some regard for the impact as
                        well as the income derived, but I have not had much success.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> thanked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> for attending this session and
                        expressed the Commission’s desire to be of assistance in connection with any

                        States: Their Role in Foreign Relations</p>
                    <p>Like the nations of the world—new and old—I suppose government officials span
                        the spectrum of development. Some have been on the job long enough to be
                        fully developed—in the particular situations they are called upon to
                        administer; others, like myself, are newly come to their present
                        responsibilities and hence are, in the language of development, “newly
                        developing.” All of us—to use Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK_1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>’s metaphor for nations in their various stages of
                        growth—are like “beads <pb n="221" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_221"/>being moved
                        along on a string,” being pushed farther along by experience and the
                        responsibilities of office just as countries move farther along the line of
                        development as they acquire additional experience and greater national
                        maturity.</p>
                    <p>This comment will suggest one reason why, after only a few weeks in office, I
                        do not feel disposed to make lengthy or ringing pronouncements. Instead I
                        intend, hopefully, to stick to my subject, “The Educational and Cultural
                        Exchange Programs of the United States,” to which I have added “Their Role
                        in Foreign Relations.” Playing an effective role in our foreign relations is
                        of course the end purpose of all our international activities.</p>
                    <p>I am grateful for the invitation to be here, to discuss with you some of the
                        opportunities these programs present to us in Washington, to people in 120
                        countries of the world with which we have exchange agreements, and to you in
                        literally hundreds of communities across the United States. And so I propose
                        to present some first impressions of principal program activities and
                        relationships in this great enterprise of providing purposeful exchanges in
                        an environment of continuing international change.</p>
                    <p>You are attending this conference primarily because of your interest in the
                        participant training program of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>. Your
                        meetings have not been oriented primarily to the international political
                        crises that occupy so much of the time and energy of diplomats. I am,
                        however, reminded of a phrase that former Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_ADG_1">Acheson</persName> used some years ago to describe
                        the number of methods needed to conduct effectively our relations with the
                        people of other countries. The phrase is “total diplomacy.”</p>
                    <p>The Government’s exchange programs provide an example of what he meant
                        because, aside from diplomatic negotiation and economic and military
                        cooperation, they constitute a further facet of our foreign relations—a
                        facet that involves the movement of people for purposes of education,
                        training, observation, and research and with essential supporting activities
                        by citizens and community groups for foreign visitors coming to this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Within this aspect of our diplomacy—the exchange of persons—we of course have
                        a great diversity of plans and programs. You have been well briefed on the
                        aims and methods of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s participant
                        training program. My first function, therefore, is to outline briefly the
                        character and scope of the educational and cultural exchange programs of the
                        Department of State. While other agencies have exchange activities, State
                        and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> represent the great bulk of the
                        exchanges that look to local communities and individual citizens for vital
                        assistance and support.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><pb n="222" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_222"/>Department
                        of State Programs</p>
                    <p>The largest category of exchanges in the Department’s program is students.
                        There were about 9,000 individuals in the Department’s total
                        exchange-of-persons program this last academic year; of these almost half,
                        some 4,000, were students—both American students going abroad and foreign
                        students coming here.</p>
                    <p>Since our primary interest today is the foreign visitor, let me mention
                        briefly three points of special interest about foreign students. The first
                        is that only some 3,000 foreign students—about 5 percent of the estimated
                        58,000 foreign students in the United States this last academic year—were
                        grantees under the Department’s own programs. With comparable <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> grantees, the total of foreign students
                        here under Government grants does not exceed 10 percent.</p>
                    <p>This leads to the second point I want to make, namely, our relationship to
                        the other 90 percent. The Government, like your own organizations, feels a
                        concern that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> foreign students, regardless of how
                        they came here, find the best <hi rend="italic">total</hi> experience that
                        can be made available to them. Both humanitarian purpose and national
                        interest coincide on this point.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the authorizations of the new <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName>
                            Act<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">See <ref target="#d52fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 52</ref>.</note> for services to all foreign students, and
                        in line with the importance attached to the whole question of foreign
                        students by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s
                        administration, we have been taking steps to stimulate greater private
                        support activities for foreign students and to broaden government’s own
                        participation. We cannot assume fixed financial support for all foreign
                        students, but in every feasible way we want to help improve the quality of
                        the total experience they have here. This means, for example, a series of
                        efforts to help more foreign students find summer jobs or other useful
                        summer experience, and I am glad to report that, through both private and
                        governmental activity, we have made real gains on this problem this year.
                        Before another year is out we hope there will be other substantial gains in
                        improving and expanding procedures for selection, orientation, and
                        counseling, both overseas and here.</p>
                    <p>Another point about the foreign students who come here under Department
                        grants is that they are, for the most part, graduate students. About 85
                        percent of our foreign-student grant funds are “invested,” so to speak, on
                        the graduate level.</p>
                    <p>A second principal category in the State Department program is, of course,
                        foreign leaders and specialists. This program had its origins <pb n="223"
                            facs="0260" xml:id="pg_223"/>in the late thirties. Following World War
                        II it took a major advancement in numbers because of the increase in German,
                        Austrian, and Japanese grantees. As a historical footnote, the numbers of
                        those grantees, and of those coming under the technical training programs of
                        predecessor agencies of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, led many
                        American communities to realize the need for further organization if they
                        were to assist adequately the Government’s program of acquainting such
                        visitors with American life and institutions by firsthand observation. And
                        as councils and other groups assisting with foreign leader and specialist
                        grantees exchanged experiences, they saw the need for national coordinating
                        services which has brought into being the cosponsor of this conference,
                            <gloss target="#t_COSERV_1">COSERV</gloss> [National Council for
                        Community Services to International Visitors].</p>
                    <p>During this last academic year some 2,300 foreign leaders and specialists,
                        including student leaders traveling in groups, were brought to this country
                        by the Department for short-term, averaging about 60-day, visits. A word
                        about the basic thinking behind this program will throw light on the
                        programming arranged for these visitors after they get here. The people who
                        occupy leadership or specialist roles in their own countries are usually
                        active people; they have busy careers, special interests, and curiosity.
                        They usually have well-defined professional or career interests. Their
                        programming here is, therefore, built around the core of these interests.
                        The range of counterpart relationships set up in this country must be as
                        broad as the careers represented and may include supreme court justices,
                        editors and publishers, heads of labor unions, government officials,
                        university presidents, leaders of women’s organizations, and representatives
                        of the creative arts, among others.</p>
                    <p>The aim in the invitations to foreign leaders and specialists is to bring to
                        this country the “philosophical traveler,” in George Santayana’s memorable
                        phrase—those who possess, as he said, “fixed interests and faculties, to be
                        served by travel.”</p>
                    <p>From their visits here these “philosophical travelers” gain new insights
                        into, and understanding of, American life and institutions. A leader in
                        women’s activities in the Republic of Togo—and also Assistant Director of
                        the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs—was a recent grantee. She
                        observed women at work here in a variety of fields, in schools and welfare
                        institutions and civic activities, among others. Her visit was concentrated
                        largely in small towns and rural areas since Togo is predominantly
                        agricultural. Before leaving she spoke of the “sense of solidarity” women
                        have in this country toward civic activities and her desire to encourage
                        this sense in her own country.</p>
                    <p>Because of the excellent cooperation of private organizations of all kinds,
                        the experience of foreign visitors can be rich and varied. An example from a
                        wide variety was the visit of two newspaper editors <pb n="224" facs="0261"
                            xml:id="pg_224"/>from India to Emporia, Kansas, where <persName

                        succeeded his father as editor and publisher, reported their experience in
                        an article in the <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi> in which he
                        described the kind of “close view” they had “of an average American small
                        town—not rich, and not poor.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign leaders are also invited in groups, according to professional
                        interest, as well as individually. Likewise, leader groups of college
                        students are brought to this country. Early next month, for example, 70
                        students from the University of São Paulo in Brazil will arrive for 3 weeks
                        in this country. Ten days will be spent in a seminar at Harvard on American
                        economic and political institutions. They will then be guests in private
                        homes in New England and make a few days’ stop in Washington before
                        returning to Brazil.</p>
                    <p>But it is like carrying coals to Newcastle to discuss foreign
                        leader/specialist activities of the Department at any great length to this

                        personal experience with grantees. I have discussed leader/specialist
                        activities primarily to provide general background for some later remarks in

                    <p>Both of these principal categories I have just discussed—foreign leaders and

                        enabled us to bring in students and leader/specialists from abroad. Our

                        made a part of this record. It is the category we call cultural
                        presentations, a program under which American performing artists are sent
                        abroad on tours to demonstrate the cultural interests and achievements of
                        the American people. There has been great variety in the program, from the
                        Juilliard String Quartet to <persName corresp="#p_AL_1">Louis

                        theatrical company, from the New York City Ballet to the Baird Marionettes.
                        Until now, this program has been devoted exclusively to sending our own
                        artists abroad, but, with the expanded legisla<pb n="225" facs="0262"

                        nonprofit performances, principally for university and other academic
                        audiences. This would provide a further opportunity for citizen and

                    <p>The programs we have been discussing—those of <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss> and of State—came into existence at different times and to
                        serve different needs. But they are interrelated at several points and
                        mutually reinforcing. All are fundamentally directed to a great aim of U.S.
                        foreign policy: to help create the conditions for what President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> has called “a free and diverse
                        world”—rather than a rigid, monolithic world.</p>
                    <p>Diversity in exchange programs is necessary if we are to deal effectively
                        with diverse peoples and their varied interests and needs in their different
                        stages of development. State, for example, has its primary exchange focus on
                        “mutual understanding.” In the new <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> Act
                        the fundamental purpose is “to increase mutual understanding between the
                        people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of
                        educational and cultural exchange. . . .”</p>
                    <p>The act sets forth these further purposes:</p>

                    <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s programs, as you have heard from
                        others during this conference, contribute directly and effectively to mutual
                        understanding, but their essential authorization goes to a different point.
                        In the Act for International Development of 1961 strong emphasis was given
                        to the concept of human resource development through “programs of technical
                            cooperation.”<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">The Foreign Assistance Act of
                            1961 (see <ref target="#d24fn21">footnote 21, Document 24</ref>), which
                            established <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, is also referred to as

                        and social development, with human resource development a major and growing
                        component of this effort. “The development of human resources is a prime
                        objective of the Agency for International Development,” Mr. <persName

                        of effective technical and managerial skills in various fields of organized
                        endeavor, public and private. . . .”</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> participant training grantees are here,
                        first of all, for technical training on a project-oriented basis but are
                        also enabled and encouraged to obtain a better understanding of American
                        institutions and culture as a part of their “programming” while they are
                        here. Here is one example of how the aims of <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss> coincide with our own.</p>
                    <p>Both <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and State cover a wide age range.
                        In its academic grants <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> begins at the
                        preparatory school level, and in its support of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ASPAU_1">ASPAU</gloss> program for African students—the
                        African Scholarship Program of American Universities—undergirds the general
                        academic training of highly selected undergraduate students. On the
                        participant training level, the average age is about 30. The State programs
                        cover the range from students to national leaders of senior rank.</p>
                    <p>The underlying, unifying idea in all our approaches—both governmental and
                        nongovernmental—is that in diversity there is strength. We depend on
                        diversity, on the contributions to our national life that come from all
                        elements of our varied society. It marks our training programs and exchanges
                        which must be directed toward highly developed countries, toward those just
                        achieving industrialization, and toward others where this badge of modernity
                        is not yet being worn. Different kinds of training and education are
                        therefore required. And public support for this varied effort must
                        necessarily rest on a broad and diverse base.</p>
                    <p>In calling this meeting <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has testified
                        amply to its own faith in this general proposition. Here at this conference,
                        for example, we have representatives of the land-grant colleges and State
                        universities—those great centers of training and enlightenment which had
                        their common origin a century ago in the farsighted act which the son of a
                        Vermont blacksmith-farmer, Senator Justin Morrill, brought into being. We
                        know it as the Morrill Act of 1862; the centennial anniversary date comes in
                        just a few days from now.<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5">Lincoln signed the
                            Morrill Act, also known as the Land-Grant College Act, into law on July
                            2, 1862.</note> We are all, I think, even more aware than before of the
                        dynamic role these institutions play not only, as in their founding years,
                        in practical service to their State and regional communities, but now in
                        varied services to an international constituency all across the world.</p>
                    <p>Then, we have here the comparatively youthful <gloss target="#t_COSERV_1"
                            >COSERV</gloss> group, cosponsor of this conference, which only in May,
                        under the leadership of Mrs. Charles N. Bang of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJH_1">Cleveland</persName> World Affairs Council, completed
                        its first independent regional conference. We all look confidently <pb
                            n="227" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_227"/>ahead to the growing benefits to
                        come from this Council’s coordinating work on behalf of some 75 individual
                        community organizations in 65 cities, from Honolulu to New York and from
                        Miami to Seattle.</p>
                    <p>The National Association of Foreign Student Advisers is another great source
                        of strength for the exchange effort. Its members are directly involved in
                        personal problems on more than 1,200 college and university campuses of the
                        Nation, and they also keep closely attuned to new national needs and
                        policies. <gloss target="#t_NAFSA_1">NAFSA</gloss> brings unique experience
                        and service and dedication to the needs of our growing numbers of foreign
                        student visitors.</p>
                    <p>Many other organizations represented here, as well as other parts of the
                        academic community, government, industry, and labor—all sectors, public and
                        private—provide additional centers of strength. As a result, we have in this
                        combination of strengths a new affirmation of the traditional American faith
                        in diversity—in different kinds of organizations and individuals coming
                        together <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> to build unified strength for a
                        common task.</p>
                    <p>This conference has afforded us all a chance to see the identities and
                        complementarities of interest of private organizations, individuals, and
                        government. And it has given us in government the opportunity to express our
                        great sense of dependence on the voluntary service of diverse private groups
                        and private citizens, and our deep gratitude to you for it.</p>
                    <p>Our interlocking interests are leading to the preparation of a booklet we
                        hope to have available by early fall. The Department does not have, by its
                        very nature, as many publications of an instructive type as do some other
                        government agencies with special constituencies—with publications, for
                        example, such as seed-testing manuals or on how to start a small business. I
                        have often wished we might do something of the kind. I am now able to say
                        that we will have a booklet that will meet the general specification. It is
                        a sort of seed manual, in a sense. It is a booklet on <hi rend="italic">The
                            Seed of Nations</hi>—a phrase the President used in a talk to foreign
                        students at the White House—and it deals with foreign students and what
                        American communities and organizations and families are doing, and can do,
                        to help them.<note n="6" xml:id="d85fn6">In remarks made on May 10, 1961, at

                            for your country. In every case all of you represent a sacrifice not
                            only on behalf of yourselves but in behalf of your country and the
                            people within your country who were responsible for sending you here to

                        designed to meet. Exchanges as a means of reaching these goals are concerned
                        with developed and developing nations, both friendly and unfriendly. They

                        “capital value of man” and the yield on investment in human resources.</p>
                    <p>“Development,” once of limited meaning, has in the last few years been
                        expanded to embrace human resource development, which lies at the base of
                        economic and social growth. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has pointed
                        out that the “human resources gap” varies from country to country in the
                        light of a nation’s objectives and development goals. If human resource
                        development plans are to meet individual country situations, they must be
                        flexible. Individual country planning is therefore being given strong
                        emphasis in the Government. This effort to relate exchange programs to
                        particular needs and priorities and objectives of individual countries, and
                        integrating them with other relevant activities, is leading to closer
                        collaboration in the exchanges of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>,
                        State, and other agencies, public and private.</p>
                    <p>There is need for mutually reinforcing efforts, too, in preserving national
                        cultures in nations on the road to industrialization. This is a vitally
                        important aspect of nation building. The impact of modernization will mean
                        changes, but the changes need to be adaptations of old cultural patterns,
                        old value systems, and historic symbols so that these social moorings will
                        not be swept away. Everything feasible must be done to preserve the
                        indigenous arts, the national monuments, and other great symbols of a
                        society’s traditions. A common language, common ethnic origins, and common
                        geography may not make a nation. There are cultural experiences and
                        traditions, usually expressed in the plastic arts or in dance or music, that
                        may really be the social bonding that holds a people together. We must
                        therefore think in terms of helping to safeguard these indigenous arts as an
                        early and essential part of any country plan. Fortunately, the cultural
                        roots of most nations lie deep. For example, Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD_1">Rusk</persName> has recently pointed to <pb n="229"

                                >Rusk</persName> spoke before the annual meeting of the American
                            Historical Association in Washington on December 30, 1961. In his
                            remarks, he stated: “Despite a Communist monopoly of education and
                            propaganda, the peoples of Eastern Europe remain loyal to their culture
                            and to their nationhood.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bulletin</hi>, January 15, 1962, p. 87)]</note></p>
                    <p>The goals we seek were illuminated a few weeks ago at the University of
                        California in Berkeley, where President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> spoke on the role of the university in the building
                        of world order.<note n="8" xml:id="d85fn8">Ibid., Apr. 16, 1962, p. 615.
                            [Footnote is in the original. The President spoke at the March 22
                            Charter Day ceremonies held in Memorial Stadium at the University of
                            California-Berkeley. The address is also printed in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Public Papers: Kennedy, 1962</hi>, pp. 263–266.]</note> “. . . the
                        pursuit of knowledge itself implies,” he said, “a world where men are free
                        to follow out the logic of their own ideas. . . . It implies, I believe, the
                        kind of world which is emerging before our eyes—the world produced by the
                        revolution of national independence which is today, and has been since 1945,
                        sweeping across the face of the world.”</p>
                    <p>“No one can doubt,” he continued, “that the wave of the future is not the
                        conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the
                        diverse energies of free nations and free men.”</p>
                    <p>We look hopefully forward to “a free and diverse world”—toward a “more
                        flexible world order,” as the President has described it. We know that, as
                        we press forward toward this goal, the role of education and training
                        becomes ever more important to this kind of world.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of educational and cultural exchanges and training programs gives
                        strong support to the broad national aim of building, with other peoples, a
                        community of independent nations. In the underdeveloped areas in the
                        southern half of the world, for example, we can encourage the emergence—from
                        all the ferment of modernization—of a genuine community of independent
                        nations. We can help them modernize, not in our image but in the image they
                        themselves formulate out of their own unique histories, cultures,
                        aspirations, and observations of other cultures and societies.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the principal fact that distinguishes the United States from the
                        Communist world, with respect to the less developed countries, is that our
                        aspirations for these countries largely coincide with their aspirations for
                        themselves. Our political aims, then, are for a world in which their, and
                        our, aspirations can be realized. This cannot be a rigid, monolithic world.
                        It can only be a free and diverse world.</p>
                    <p>The need for the services you provide—for participant trainees, foreign
                        leaders and specialists, and the like, as well as foreign stu<pb n="230"
                            facs="0267" xml:id="pg_230"/>dents—can be expected to rise in the years
                        ahead as the numbers of such visitors increase. We will need more hands and
                        heads to do the job. We will need to look at our procedures as still
                        developing. The attention and help that may be suited to the needs of a
                        visitor from a Western society may fail to meet some of the needs of those
                        now coming in increasing numbers from the non-Western world. We have by no
                        means yet found all the best ways to help the foreign student or trainee or
                        leader or specialist realize the maximum value from his experience in this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Here is an area for almost unlimited initiative and imagination on the part
                        of individual volunteers and groups who share a concern for the foreign
                        visitor. Your experience, evolving out of thoughtful service in a variety of
                        forms, can help those in other communities—and those of us in
                        government—toward more useful planning and action. The experience some
                        community groups have had in providing training sessions for host families,
                        for example, should be widely shared.</p>
                    <p>In this brief time I have only tried to touch some of the highlights which
                        this subject and this occasion suggest. I am confident the pattern of
                        diversity will serve well to meet the increasing demands of the years ahead.
                        With your continuing imaginative and generous help—and, hopefully, your
                        growing numbers—our varied programs, public and private, for bringing
                        foreign visitors to this country can be increasingly important factors in
                        the “total diplomacy” our times require.</p>

                    <p>We do not plan major exploitation of the first anniversary of the Berlin
                        Wall, August 13. It has of course been the subject of continuing <pb n="231"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">TREATMENT</p>
                    <p>We shall not ignore the anniversary, however. As the anniversary approaches
                        you may expect the media to provide materials (and, at your discretion,
                        provided you do not make a major campaign of the anniversary, you may

                        points:</p>
                    <p>(1) In East Berlin, for the first time in history, a regime has found it
                        necessary to immure its citizens in order to keep them from fleeing—and
                        still the captive people seek a way out by every manner of ingenious
                        means.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Wall is an open, embarrassing symbol of Communist failure—of
                        Communist inability to compete with the way of life which democracy,
                        diversity and free choice have made possible in West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>(3) The United States and its allies are determined both to stand by the
                        people of free Berlin and, without surrendering Allied rights, to continue
                        working for an equitable and peaceful solution of the crisis which <persName

                        when it comes to foreign policy . . . it’s too complex. They would like to
                        have an opinion but they are content to “leave it to the people in
                        Washington.” They think those people are doing a pretty fair job. There is
                        no tension, no criticism. I heard not a single comment on resumption of
                        nuclear testing. Confidence in the President’s judgment is high. “He must be
                        working right hard, hasn’t ‘fleshened up’ since he took over,” was the
                        comment of a North Carolina mountain woman. There is a very slight hangover
                        from Cuba: “He didn’t follow through on that one, but that won’t happen

                        . . . that they have given up trying to understand and don’t even have the
                        desire to try. The emotional belligerence of all defeated people is in
                        evidence in this area.</p>
                    <p>The tobacco crop looks good. There have been “gully-washin” rains, and not
                        many people “looking for work,” so they are content to leave the foreign
                        business to you. And though I rode my favorite theme, that maybe you should
                        tell them more of what their country is trying to do, explain <hi
                            rend="italic">why</hi> we do what we do, no one asserted that you had
                        failed in this fashion. (Could it be that I was wrong in our last
                        conversation on this subject?) I do not know, but I <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Here are one or two quotations to give you the flavor of the past four
                        days—</p>

                    <p>A comment on your daughter from a woman selling cider in a small valley in

                        Elizabethan.</p>
                    <p>Finally, and perhaps of importance in a conversation after dinner at a motel
                        in Roaring Gap, North Carolina (and that’s just about the buckle of the
                        Bible Belt) an ancient said: “That young man done settled one thing. There
                        ain’t no Catholic issue in this country no more. Come sixty-four, nobody’s

                    <p>I thought you would be interested in three new approaches we are undertaking
                        at <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in the field of books. They add up
                        to something of a “<gloss target="#t_CARE_1">CARE</gloss>” program in books.
                        As soon as we reach agreement on a suitable statement to be made by the
                        various publishers that will assure us of the non-profit characteristic of
                        the programs, we will proceed. These programs have been developed under the
                        leadership of <persName corresp="#p_MS_1">Sanford Marlowe</persName>, who is
                        Director of our Office of Private Cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_MS_1"

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Major Paperback Publishers</hi>. This program, directed
                        to the American people at large, will involve the largest of the mass
                        paperback publishers: Pocket Books Incorporated, Bantam Books, Dell
                        Publications, New American Library, and Fawcett Publications.</p>
                    <p>Each of the publishers will make up one or more book packets of 10 titles,
                        each in a given category (e.g., American literature, history, youth, etc.).
                        All titles will be selected by us. Each packet, to be advertised in all
                        coming book releases, will be offered for sale to the public for about
                        $4.00. Once purchased, the packet will be turned over to us for distribution
                        by our post in the country selected by the purchaser.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Spanish and other language kits</hi>. We are now
                        developing a packet in Spanish that will include 14 translations of American
                        works and will sell for $10.00. The General Federation of Women’s Clubs has
                        indicated willingness to support this project which will work along the same
                        lines as the project described above. This project will be primarily in
                        support of the Alliance for Progress and if it proves successful we will
                        want to develop similar libraries in Portuguese for Brazil and, later, in
                        French for Africa.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Scholastic Book Services</hi>. This firm, which sells
                        directly to the classroom only, publishes 12 children’s magazines and about
                        100 originals and reprints in paperback each year, ranging in level from the
                        first grade to the twelfth. Scholastic Book Services will offer two
                        miniature libraries for sale through their eight classroom book clubs to be

                        children overseas. The first library, at the primary level, will have 34
                        titles; the second, at the secondary level, will have 23 titles. All titles
                        will be selected by us and the libraries, which sell for $10.00, will be
                        distributed overseas by us.</p>

                        in this town. It should perform useful coordination between our own branches
                        within and other elements outside the Agency. It should as well examine what
                        we are doing and not doing.</p>
                    <p>As an example, there are African students studying in Russia that call at our

                        particularly useful in their travels to other European capitals and

                        American publicity about anti-Semitism in Russia. With this as a lead

                    <p>It was suggested that if the bureaucracy could be relaxed to obtain funds we
                        could have a person or persons travel for long periods of time in Bloc
                        countries, writing articles, cutting tapes, etc. To continue this for a long
                        period we would, however, need an overcomplement of language speakers.</p>
                    <p>Paid vacations in Russian resort areas were mentioned. An officer on salary
                        would spend time in resorts such as Sochi and in doing so contact a wide
                        range of Russians.</p>
                    <p>Tom Tuch’s interest rose.</p>
                    <p>Russian tourists coming to the United States could be contacted and be
                        interviewed. They are more official than tourists of other nations, and
                        hence worth the effort of contact.</p>
                    <p><pb n="237" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_237"/>It was suggested that we could
                        investigate Russian society, observe how well they are developing, and
                        speculate what they might develop into. This entails telling them things
                        about themselves which they do not know.</p>
                    <p>The necessity of cooperation with other Western European nations was
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LH_1">Loomis</persName> described the dual mission of
                        Project Larry in Liberia: we are to be both the Voice of America and the
                        Voice of Africa. He observed that we might extend a similar mission to our
                        Bloc broadcasts: become both the Voice of America and the Voice of
                        Communism. This would entail relating matters such as what goes on in other
                        Communist parties, who controls Cuba, who is on top in African Communism,
                        etc. The Russian people have only one source of information; this would seek
                        to give them an alternative.</p>
                    <p>The need for government coordination on visiting dignitaries was mentioned.

                        <salute>Dear Mac,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I am addressing this to you in reply to a letter dated July 27, 1962 from Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Amory</persName> of the Bureau of the
                        Budget. His letter, a copy of which is enclosed, requested the views of the
                        Department of State concerning Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Attached but not printed. In it, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Amory</persName> wrote: “We felt the need,
                            however, for an authoritative statement by the Department of its views
                            as to the desirability of continuing these programs, or, if such be the
                            case, its suggestions for modifying them. I do not think such a letter
                            need be particularly lengthy nor need it review the factual data which
                            is available in pretty good shape. Essentially what I am requesting is
                            that the Department ‘stand up and be counted’ on these two
                            institutions.”</note></p>
                    <p>With regard to Radio Liberty, the consensus here is that the function of the
                        Radio remains useful, and that its operation is generally satisfactory.
                        Although in an effort of this sort there is always room for improvement, we
                        do not have any critical problems with Radio Liberty.</p>
                    <p>We believe Radio Free Europe has an important role to play as an unofficial
                        voice of the West and we support and urge a continuation of this operation.
                        We therefore take an active and continuing interest in the work of this
                        organization and try to follow it as closely as we can. Because of this
                        significance of RFE we also feel that there should be further efforts made
                        toward the improvement of its operation.</p>
                    <p>During the course of this year we requested and received assessments of RFE
                        from our Missions in those Eastern European countries to which RFE
                        broadcasts. In summary, our Missions concluded that:</p>
                    <p>1. RFE is, in the main, doing a more effective job in an important, complex
                        and difficult undertaking.</p>
                    <p>2. This represents a contrast to RFE broadcasts of several years ago and
                        reflects desirable modifications in terms of present United States policy
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>3. Occasional mistakes of varying magnitude and some programs of lesser value
                        occur. The proportion of these objectionable or deficient broadcasts to the
                        total output has been reduced.</p>
                    <p><pb n="239" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_239"/>4. Adjustments should be made (in
                        line with suggestions by the Missions) to increase the effectiveness of
                        these broadcasts in the service of United States objectives.</p>
                    <p>5. Although on occasion an “emigre” rather than a “European” approach is
                        still discernable in current RFE broadcasts, they tend generally to support
                        the purpose of keeping Eastern European listeners in touch with and oriented
                        toward Western life—especially in terms of association with Western
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>We agree generally with this judgement but desire at the same time to make
                        the following additional comment. First, we note with appreciation the
                        encouraging developments which have taken place more recently in the
                        approach of RFE, giving it more the character of a European radio. We hope
                        this development continues. Second, we believe the efforts of the Radio to
                        talk to elements within or close to the regimes should be strengthened,
                        recognizing that the priority target audience must include those persons and
                        groups who are in a position to play a role in developments in Eastern
                        Europe in the foreseeable future. Third, we are convinced that the Radio
                        must drop that type of broadcast which reflects émigré value judgements of
                        the regimes and key Communist personalities, and thus runs a predictable and
                        substantial risk of alienating a primary target audience.</p>
                    <p>On this basis, we are happy to “stand up and be counted” in support of a
                        continued program for the next several years for Radio Free Europe as an
                        important instrument for the advancement of our foreign policy objectives in
                        Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        Have all been tried and have all failed? Given the relative predictability
                        of the growing season, can not the Viet Cong be ambushed or otherwise
                        prevented from harvesting these crops?</p>
                    <p>No matter how reasonable our case may be, I am convinced that we cannot
                        persuade the world—particularly that large part of it which does not get
                        enough to eat—that defoliation “is good for you.” Nonetheless, should the
                        President decide to proceed with the project, it is important that we be
                        given a brief period to explain to the world exactly what we are doing and
                        why. This will reduce, to some extent, the impact of the inevitable
                        Communist propaganda campaign.</p>

                            under an attached August 22 memorandum, noting: “The main thrust of the
                            program which I envisage is an information program directed to youth
                            which concentrates primarily on outlining to them <hi rend="italic"
                                >their</hi> responsibilities in helping to achieve reform and social
                            welfare. We point out to them what we are prepared to do when they—and
                            the rest of their countrymen—have assumed their own civic
                            responsibilities. Essentially we should try to force them to realize
                            what their own sloganeering implies in terms of action and describe what
                            related actions we are willing to take as a supporting step. In so
                            allying ourselves with their own aspirations we can provide information
                            about the U.S. directly related to their hopes. We can be precise in
                            showing how the democratic process can and should function to achieve
                            economic and social well being.”</note></head>

                    <p>I. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a unique ability to communicate
                        with those people overseas who are not within the governing power structure
                        of any country, a structure which, incidentally, includes more than just
                        government.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> must, for
                        the most part, restrict their activities to that governing structure.</p>
                    <p>Youth, of course, lies without the power structure but is an audience of
                        significant importance to the U.S. So it falls largely to our lot to program
                        for this audience; largely but not exclusively as I shall point out
                        later.</p>
                    <p>The problem is not agreeing on the audience—youth. The problem is: what
                        segment of that particular audience do we want to reach; and with what
                        purpose in mind?</p>
                    <p>It is here that I’ll have to get into the tricky business of generalizing;
                        but that has its compensations. First of all, the Agency <hi rend="italic"
                            >should</hi> generalize and let it be the burden of each post to
                        demonstrate the exceptions to Agency generalizations. The generalizations
                        will at least provide us with some broad guidelines against which to
                        exercise a judgment on performance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">A.</hi> What segment of the youth
                        audience do we want to reach?</p>
                    <p>1. I plump against the illiterate because I do not think that in and of
                        himself he is or will become politically important. The illiterate, in <pb
                            n="243" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_243"/>fact, is the numerical strength and
                        perhaps the motive power of the politically minded leader. But he follows;
                        he is more apt to be a “true believer” than a political activist. Being
                        illiterate he has little on which to base judgments; his responses tend to
                        be emotional.</p>
                    <p>So even in those countries where the majority of youth are illiterate, I
                        claim we ought to concentrate our fire on the <hi rend="italic"
                            >literate</hi> youth. There is, after all, no harm in concentrating
                        limited resources on the most meaningful target. Conversely, there is
                        considerable danger in claiming “youth” as the audience and spreading
                        ourselves so thin that our effect becomes invisible.</p>
                    <p>2. Literate youth does not mean “student” exclusively. But I’d like to
                        discuss that segment of the audience briefly. First of all, the student is
                        institutionalized, and therefore to a considerable extent he is a captive
                        audience. We know where he is; in what numbers; and how to reach him.</p>
                    <p>But we still get to the question of how far down we want to reach in the
                        educational structure. Below college? I doubt it. The deeper down you go,
                        the greater the audience; the greater the audience, the more dispersed our
                        effort and effect. Below college, I tend to believe that political <hi
                            rend="italic">orientation</hi> may have begun; but, in fact, political
                            <hi rend="italic">commitments</hi> have not yet been made.</p>
                    <p>It’s the college student we want. And the task of working on youth below the
                        college level properly belongs to <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>. I’ll
                        come to that shortly.</p>
                    <p>3. Given the student, what about the rest of literate youth? They’re found in
                        all occupations; but critically they’re in government, communications and
                        the arts. Those in the professions generally have started to acquire a
                        vested interest; they’re not as radical as those in government and the arts.
                        Government workers may take on a vested interest; but at lower echelons they
                        tend to be impatient, radical and frequently looking for quick access to
                        power. In the arts he most frequently represents the Steinbacks, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DPJR_1">John Dos Passos</persName>, and Hemingways of our
                        early thirties—vocal, indignant, oriented to the left. It should be borne in
                        mind that he commands a following, whether writer (this includes
                        journalists), painter or poet; and his importance to us is more than he
                        himself—it is his command of a following.</p>
                    <p>4. Finally, there is that large group who are disenchanted because they are
                        under or unemployed. They are harder to locate and, once located, harder to
                        “reach”.</p>
                    <p>5. In essence, then I think we are after literate youth—in college,
                        government, art—or under or unemployed.</p>
                    <p>We are after the social rebel; the social dissident who, politically, is most
                        apt to be in leftist-oriented parties. And why not? It can be stated with
                        some reasonable certainty that the more pressing the need <pb n="244"
                            facs="0281" xml:id="pg_244"/>for reform, the greater the drift to the
                        left. It is from the left that reform is most likely to emanate.</p>
                    <p>Our classic problem is that the normal rebellion and political zeal of youth
                        are captured by the promises of communism and channeled into communist
                        organizations. I don’t think this is inescapable; in fact I think that the
                        rebellion and dissension can be turned to our advantage—assuming our
                        willingness to take political risks.</p>

                        Them?</p>
                    <p>It is not my purpose to spell out the precise mechanics and programs we
                        should undertake to reach youth, but rather to suggest three major
                        approaches which should be directed to those segments of the audience I have
                        delineated above; and which, incidentally, will command through them an even
                        wider audience.</p>
                    <p>According to your recent survey,<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">Presumable

                                Organization of Foreign Policy; Information Policy; United Nations;
                                Scientific Matters, Document 139</ref>.</note> the three major
                        problems of youth that affect us are: economic, lack of career
                        opportunities, and lack of information about the United States.</p>
                    <p>The economic problems we can approach directly only—first, by pointing out
                        what the people and the country must do; second, we can indicate how we can
                        support their efforts; and third, we can assume a more positive role in the
                        planning stages of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs.</p>
                    <p>The lack of information about the U.S. is not necessarily critical. A
                        stepped-up program of information about the U.S. will dissuade youth from
                        looking for drastic solutions only if we ourselves can provide meaningful
                        solutions.</p>
                    <p>A. Our primary emphasis in the Alliance for Progress, for example, has been
                        about what we are doing or propose to do. Our secondary emphasis has been on
                        what the people and the country should do. I am reasonably convinced that
                        the stick should precede the carrot if we are, through an information
                        program, to ally ourselves with revolutionary aspirations. I grant this
                        entails some political risks. Our claim to being the original
                        revolutionaries has by now become redundant and because we have been unable
                        to back it with substance, meaningless.</p>
                    <p>To state that we are for reform programs that will constitute an economic and
                        political revolution is simply not enough because this statement does
                        nothing to enlist the energies of youth. We should put more of the monkey on
                        youth’s back; urging them to undertake civic actions which will bring about
                        those very reforms essential to their own well being. We must emphasize the
                        direct responsibility of youth <pb n="245" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_245"/>to
                        help create the pressures and the climate that will bring these reforms into
                        existence. We should state that the success of their activities will
                        determine the extent of our support.</p>
                    <p>True, we cannot provide organizational structures as do the Communists. We
                            <hi rend="italic">can</hi> urge youth into meaningful activity that
                        leads to the formation of or participation in organizations which in turn
                        will press for reform.</p>
                    <p>In essence, let us adopt their own slogans (when as is frequently the case,
                        these slogans coincide with our purposes). This is a tactic which the
                        Communists have often used with us—witness their usurpation of the word
                        “democracy”. Let us embrace and urge for more education, for social reform,
                        and for economic reform, and indicate that we are their allies in these
                        revolutionary pursuits. But let’s keep the burden on them to engage in
                        responsible activities in pursuit of these goals.</p>
                    <p>B. But we must also spur <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> into
                        concentrated programs that can produce results rather than diffused and
                        tangential programs which disperse our resources and the resources of the
                        host country. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> should concentrate on
                        core problems and these frequently are concerned with economic problems
                        directly affecting youth—e.g. increased educational opportunities and the
                        need for industrialization to absorb the under or unemployed. Economic aid
                        programs must produce political and psychological as well as economic
                        results and we should urge programs intended in part to remove the very
                        problems that frustrate youth and present us with political problems.</p>
                    <p>C. Let us then narrow down our program of economic aid information (while we
                        undertake the first two activities) so that we concentrate on <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs which will be directly in support
                        of the revolutionary aspirations of youth.</p>
                    <p>Let us demonstrate to youth through this program that as they have succeeded
                        in establishing programs of reform, they have also succeeded in enlisting
                        our direct economic support.</p>
                    <p>This, I know, is a highly simplified outline of what I conceive of as an

                        admitted political problems which we would face in different countries. But
                        the cloth can be cut appropriately for each country; and in any event, we
                        shall at least begin to direct the discontent and the energy of youth into
                        channels constructive to our own national purposes.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The generally accepted concept abroad is that America is a mixed fabric from
                        which is woven every racial, national and ethnic group. Our population is a
                        pattern cut from all populations of the world.</p>
                    <p>In light of this people abroad, Africans, Asians and Europeans think of us as
                        an integrated America.</p>
                    <p>The idea for this memo grew out of a discussion involving a research project
                        assigned to me on photo material for picture display purposes. Initially, I
                        took the assignment to be an easy task, thinking that the availability of
                        materials were numerous in our library. This was quite to the contrary.
                        There exists a limit on almost every type of photograph reflecting the real
                        theme of an integrated American life.</p>
                    <p>In the area of agriculture, it was difficult to find photos of American
                        whites and Negroes working together. The same was true in industry, religion
                        and social life in general. In science there were also limitations. In
                        music, most groups were segregated photos with minor exceptions here and
                        there where one or two Negroes appeared in isolated groups. But there is
                        room for optimism.</p>
                    <p>The fact that a large segment of American life still remains segregated is
                        not the real story. There are segments of progress with a completely
                        different economic educational and social outlook. There are vast areas of
                        intergradation in the United States and we can utilize materials from those
                        to tell our story abroad. The following are a few examples:</p>
                    <p>Although many peoples abroad don’t understand the institution of American
                        baseball, they can appreciate seeing the number of Negro <pb n="247"
                            facs="0284" xml:id="pg_247"/>and Cuban players taking part in this form
                        of recreation. They can also appreciate the picture of whites and Negroes in
                        basketball, tennis, track and boxing.</p>
                    <p>In order to bring the picture more up to date which will obviously reflect a
                        different image, one can visit the Lockheed aircraft plant in Atlanta,
                        Georgia where whites and Negroes work side by side on a professional level.
                        In recent months, lunch counters have been integrated in the South. There
                        are schools and institutions, all over the country presenting an excellent
                        picture of whites and Negroes in an integrated situation. I understand that
                        the Department of Justice has increased its Negro legal staff far in excess
                        of what it was two years ago. There is the vast Post Office operation with
                        thousands of Negroes working with whites on all levels of employment. This
                        picture also reflects itself in the industrial life of our country. Beverage
                        firms, cigarette, U.S. steel, Ford and General Motors all have increased the
                        numbers of their Negro employees on a representative basis within the past
                        five years. Such photos reflecting an integrated America can be obtained by
                        establishing contact with the various public relations people working for
                        these industries.</p>
                    <p>It was interesting to watch the number of African and European children
                        standing and pointing with pride at a picture of Floyd Patterson,
                        heavyweight champion, on a wall in Nigeria. With equal interest Africans and
                        Europeans flocked to see <persName corresp="#p_AL_1">Louis
                            Armstrong</persName> and his musicians, white and Negro play at concerts
                        throughout West Africa. But there were some reservations and a number of
                        questions from Africans, Europeans and Asians about the appearance of
                        Holiday on Ice when it arrived in West Africa. They wanted to know why no
                        blacks were included. The African press dealt with this at some length.</p>
                    <p>In one of our own <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> films, “Pilgrimage
                        to Liberty”, Africans, Asians and Europeans questioned the absence of
                        American Indians and Negroes.</p>
                    <p>“If you contend that a large portion of your population is Negro, why don’t
                        we see them in these films?”, a prominent European asked after seeing
                        “Pilgrimage to Liberty.”</p>
                    <p>I recall hearing comments from the integration display we had at the World’s
                        Fair in Brussels in 1958.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">Expo 58 took place from
                            April 17 until October 19, 1958.</note> The photos, news clippings and
                        materials reflecting to some extent the picture of integration in the United
                        States were acceptable. However, many people at the Fair asked my wife and I
                        why a more substantial part of an integrated America did not appear on the
                        films shown on life in the U.S. Questions are still asked about private
                        productions, documentary films sent overseas. Criticisms over this kind of
                        content is increasing. A suggestion is that <pb n="248" facs="0285"
                            xml:id="pg_248"/>we should search for better examples of an integrated
                        America to tell our story abroad. Fortunately, there are many examples
                        around, and they are on a steady increase.</p>

                        by the U.S. Information Agency and shown by its overseas posts on a
                        world-wide basis.</p>
                    <p>United Artists will assume all distribution costs, which include the buying
                        of prints and advertising. They will retain 35% of the gross as their
                        distribution fee. The remaining 65% will be used by United Artists to
                        provide <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> with additional prints and
                        language versions. This will enable us to service the requests of our

                        unable to meet within our regular budget. Any part of the 65% which is
                        unspent will be turned over to the Treasury Department.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Ed:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>At its meeting in Washington on October 23, 1962, the Advisory Commission
                        discussed at some length the question of program content in <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. The Commission recognizes the problem
                        of sheer volume of material that is inherent in any assessment of program
                        output. At the same time, the Commission believes that there is a need to
                        review periodically the various publications prepared and distributed by
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as well as the variety of
                        programs offered by the Voice of America, both here and abroad. For it is
                        the Commission’s view that routine radio programs and publications have been
                        developed by the Agency over a period of years which may have outlived their
                        original usefulness.</p>
                    <p><pb n="253" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_253"/>Recognizing the excellent
                        arrangements under which the Agency has organized its annual personnel
                        promotion panels, the Commission recommends that you consider creating two
                        committees, or panels, for the purpose of reviewing annually or perhaps
                        semi-annually the Agency’s output in print and radio. The Commission
                        believes that the structural patterns of these committees should resemble
                        the personnel promotion panel. The committees or panels should consist of a
                        chairman, who would be either the Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> or a representative of his office, the head of the Press
                        or Broadcasting Service, and one or two public members. The public members
                        should be men who have devoted their lives to print or radio and who can
                        spend at least a month examining the format and content of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs and material as they relate to
                        the purpose, the target audience, and the impact. Men like John Sterling, Ev
                        Meade, and Don Francisco would be eminently qualified to assist the Agency
                        in this essential activity.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">In <persName
                                corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>’s response, dated December 3,
                            he commented: “The committee review plan outlined in your letter makes
                            good sense. However, I would like to see it applied only to
                            publications, since the present Broadcast Advisory Committee gives
                            adequate scrutiny to Voice of America content within inherent
                            limitations. The nature of our policy guidance affecting broadcasting
                            would make difficult any attempt by public members of a temporary
                            special committee to give useful or effective advice on <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> content.” (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>If you agree that such an activity would be beneficial, the Commission would
                        be happy to cooperate with you in finding and selecting qualified and
                        experienced persons who could serve as public members of these
                        committees.</p>
                    <p>Closely related to the problem of program content is the broader question of
                        country by country review of programs. This Commission has recommended in
                        its Reports to Congress that the Agency conduct a thorough and systematic
                        review of all the programs conducted by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> on a country by country basis. The Commission suggests
                        that you may wish to employ the instrument of the committee to assist you in
                        performing this function as well.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the Commission’s meeting, we visited the facilities of
                        the Information Center Service (<gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss>) where
                        we received an excellent briefing by <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Robert
                            Beers</persName>, the Deputy Director of this Service. We would like to
                        bring to your attention a problem that concerns the Music Division.</p>
                    <p>We discovered, for example, that the compilation and preparation of the
                        popular music record list and its distribution is slow. This can and should
                        be accelerated. Secondly, we understand that it is customary to put any post
                        that requests records on a permanent mailing list. This mailing list should
                        be checked on an annual basis by the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>.
                        He should ascertain the use to which the records have been put and he <pb
                            n="254" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_254"/>should determine whether or not the
                        post should continue to receive records. Although the Commission’s comments
                        are directed in this instance at music records, it relates to our previous
                        discussions of a more general nature when we recommended that each <gloss
                            target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> prepare and submit to the Washington
                        office an annual inventory of all material which he receives from
                            Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">An unknown hand placed two
                            checkmarks in the right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note></p>
                    <p>If the recommendations contained in this letter require further elaboration,
                        please do not hesitate to call me and I shall be happy to discuss this
                        matter with you.</p>
                    <p>The Commission asked me to express its deep concern about your recent
                        illness. It missed you at its meeting and hopes that you will be back soon
                        at the helm fully recovered and reinvigorated. The Commission also asked me

                        could end the crisis by withdrawing their weapons. Thus American insistence
                        on removal of the missile bases was the major factor in preserving the peace
                        now.</p>

                        weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty, disarmament, Chinese aggression in

                        themes:</p>
                    <p>1. The crisis has demonstrated anew that firmness in the face of intimidation
                        is the surest deterrent to aggression and the most effective guardian of
                        peace.</p>

                    <p>Putting aside the <hi rend="italic">ad hominem</hi> arguments and other
                        irrelevancies (e.g., “my judgment is better—or worse—than yours”), the
                        issues are:</p>
                    <p>1. Should the tone, emphases and content of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> news <hi rend="italic">on foreign affairs</hi> reflect the
                        policies and intentions of the United States Government?</p>
                    <p>2. Should <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> commentaries and analyses <hi
                            rend="italic">on foreign affairs</hi> reflect the nuances and special
                        emphases, as well as the main thrust, of the policies and intentions of the
                        U.S. Government?</p>
                    <p>3. If the answer to one or both of these questions is “yes,” would such
                        broadcasting be compatible with the long-term mission of the Voice, with our
                        desire for credibility, or with our policy of operating on the basis of
                        truth?</p>
                    <p>I believe the answer to all three questions is “yes.” I believe further that
                        our continued failure to operate on the basis of the first two <pb n="260"
                            facs="0297" xml:id="pg_260"/>propositions actually damages the
                        credibility and effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and,
                        more important, exposes our country to risks.</p>
                    <p>“Credibility” is a word too often used and too little understood.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Government carefully monitors and analyzes all foreign government
                        broadcasting of news and comment. We do so because we believe such
                        broadcasts are often important indicators of the intentions and policies of
                        these governments. Our broadcasts are similarly monitored and analyzed, not
                        only by the Soviets but by many lesser powers including such small nations
                        as Egypt. (Yuri Zhukov told me in Moscow: “I know more about what your Voice
                        of America is saying in Russian than you do.” I denied it—but of course he
                        was right.)</p>
                    <p>We can assume, and there is much supporting evidence, that these foreign
                        governments monitor <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts for
                        precisely the same reason we monitor theirs. They do not monitor <gloss
                            target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss> or WRC,<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2"
                            >Presumable reference to the Washington <gloss target="#t_NBC_1"
                                >NBC</gloss> affiliate.</note> except as part of their surveys of
                        private American opinion. They do monitor <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> because it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Voice of America,
                        the only full-time radio station overtly controlled and operated by the U.S.
                        Government, financed by Government funds, and directed exclusively to
                        foreign audiences.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> credibility, therefore, must be
                        considered in this context. It is not, and cannot be, the same context in
                        which <persName corresp="#p_SHK_1">Howard K. Smith</persName> operates at
                            <gloss target="#t_ABC_1">ABC</gloss> or Eric Sevareid at <gloss
                            target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss>. Thus if <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> says “the crisis has eased” when in fact the President is
                        planning to take steps which—in Russian eyes, at least—will exacerbate the
                        situation, then <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is not being credible.
                        This is too bad but not fatal. Much more dangerous to us as a nation is the
                        likelihood that <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> will
                        misread the U.S. President’s intentions on the basis of what he hears on the
                        U.S. Government’s radio.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we are not being credible when we mislead or confuse the enemy—and
                        our allies and others—with commentaries heavy on speculative interpretation
                        and “on-the-other-hands” and light on facts. (Sometimes it is desirable to
                        mask or obfuscate our intentions, but the decision to do so should be a
                        calculated one made by the President or his responsible advisors, not by a
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> official or newsman or
                        commentator.)</p>
                    <p>This is not a reflection on the wisdom or judgment or “policy sense” of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> broadcasters and policy officers.
                        No man can guess very accurately for very long on what goes on in the
                        President’s mind or in his councils. My argument is that it is neither
                        credible nor prudent to do so on a government radio station, whether you do
                        it yourself or lean on a wire service or the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi>.</p>
                    <p><pb n="261" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_261"/>Some argue that the Voice is not and
                        should not be “tactical.” I argue that news is timely, and that people and
                        governments react to news now, tonight, tomorrow—not just in five or ten
                        years. They react to the tone, the nuances, the emphases. If this be true,
                        then news itself is “tactical” and if we want to limit our radio to
                        long-term “strategic” purposes (like a book or a film) perhaps we should not
                        broadcast news and timely commentaries at all.</p>
                    <p>But I do not believe this to be necessary. The <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> has no patent on the truth; our government, with a few
                        notorious slippages, has operated on the basis of certain “self-evident
                        truths” since its birth. If we believe, as I do, that our government’s
                        foreign policies are honest and enlightened, then making policy
                        considerations pre-eminent in <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> output
                        will enhance, not damage, the Voice’s credibility and effectiveness in both
                        the short and long runs.</p>
                    <p>I believe our broadcasters and policy people have the ability to do this not
                        crudely, not with an axe, but skillfully, subtly and—above
                        all—deliberately.</p>
                    <p>I am sure none of us—“uptown” or at the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                        >VOA</gloss>—thinks international broadcasting is a game or an end in
                        itself. I feel very deeply that if it ever were, Cuba has demonstrated that
                        it cannot ever be again. If there is a moral principle at stake here, it is
                        the survival and triumph of our people and our institutions, indeed of free
                        institutions and all men everywhere.</p>

                    <p>The report began with an overview of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                        function:</p>
                    <p>“The U.S.–U.S.S.R. confrontation over Cuba in 1962 demonstrated once again to
                        the world that Sino-Soviet aggressive intentions are worldwide. Berlin, the
                        Chinese Communist invasions of India, Communist insurrection in South
                        Vietnam and Laos as well as Cuba, are part of geographically separated
                        incidents that illustrate potential threat, menace, and aggression. These
                        events have made it clear to every thinking neutral power the true ambitions
                        and intentions of international communism.</p>
                    <p>“For example, on October 25, 1962, in the midst of the Chinese Communist
                        invasion of Indian territory, the embattled and disillusioned <persName
                            corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nehru</persName> was finally compelled to say ‘we are
                        getting out of touch with realities in a modern world. We are living in an
                        artificial atmosphere of our creation and we have been shaken out of
                        it.’</p>
                    <p>“The task of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is to depict and
                        document these ‘realities in a modern world’ to the peoples of the world; to
                        unmask the true designs of Sino-Soviet communism. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> must also disseminate information which will help
                        strengthen the economic, political and ideological bases of national
                        independence in order to help make impossible external aggression or
                        internal insurrection and subversion from Communist sources. This is the
                        meaning of the cold war for the total U.S. communications effort. And it is
                        in this context that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a paramount
                        role to play.” (Ibid., pages 1–2)</p>
                    <p>The report summarized <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> performance
                        during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and highlighted five Agency
                        problem areas before analyzing <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        programs in Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Following an overview of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s history and its broad role, the
                        report turned to a discussion of the “changing missions” of the Agency:</p>
                    <p>“The changing missions that have been assigned to the foreign information
                        program partly because of changing U.S. strategy, are reflected in the
                        confusion attending the information program’s attempts to adjust to these
                        changes.</p>
                    <p><pb n="264" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_264"/>“There have been periods when the
                        Agency’s chief emphasis has been placed on ‘long-range cultural programs.’
                        And there have been other times when Agency policies, programs, and
                        operations were organized primarily around short-range, tactical, day-to-day
                        issues and the elimination of brush-fires. Both the objective reality of
                        international conditions and the strict reality of the budget have affected
                        the courses that the Agency pursued at any given time.</p>
                    <p>“In periods of intense crisis, such as in times of major U.S.–U.S.S.R.
                        strategic confrontations, the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must
                        perforce undertake important functions which are oriented around the work of
                        the fast media and aimed at getting the American position to the people of
                        the world. But, during inter-crisis periods that Agency’s emphasis has
                        fluctuated sharply.</p>
                    <p>“The difficulty with these fluctuating strategies and missions has been
                        evident in the buildup of certain operations, their drastic reductions or
                        wholesale dismantling when conditions changed and then the long laborious
                        need to rebuild them in one area or another when crises subside, Soviet
                        competition increases, or relatively calm areas flare up.</p>
                    <p>“Confusion over the purpose and role can perhaps best be seen by examining
                        the mere changes in name that have characterized the Agency’s central policy
                        office during the past 10 years.</p>
                    <p>“In August 1953 there was an Office of Policy and Plans.</p>
                    <p>“By September 1953 this became the Office of Policy and Programs.</p>
                    <p>“In March 1957 it reverted to the Office of Policy and Plans.</p>
                    <p>“But in April 1958 it became an Office of Plans.</p>
                    <p>“And in August 1962 it was and remains at present an Office of Policy.</p>
                    <p>“During this period, in response to the views of different directors and
                        different administrations, the Agency experimented with combining program
                        and policy functions, planning and policy functions, abolishing ‘policy’ or
                        abolishing ‘plans.’</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps such experimentation was inevitable as the foreign information and
                        cultural programs attempted to satisfy the requirements placed upon them by
                        conflicting views, by different directors, by competing ideas of its proper
                        role and by the objective facts of national and international affairs.</p>
                    <p>“Throughout these years of changing purpose one other fact also has become
                        evident. <hi rend="italic">During the short history of the U.S. information
                            program relatively little attention has been accorded to long-range
                            planning and policy considerations</hi>.</p>
                    <p>“This Commission believes that the Agency should have both short-range and
                        long-range objectives. It cannot escape the duty of acting as the
                        government’s foreign public relations arm on a daily basis and especially in
                        times of crisis. It has performed well and continues to perform well in
                        transmitting daily foreign policy guidance from the <pb n="265" facs="0302"
                            xml:id="pg_265"/>Department of State and in converting it to daily
                        propaganda guidance for the benefit of the fast media.</p>
                    <p>“The Commission suggests, however, that the Agency must also organize and
                        staff itself to provide long-range, forward-planning that would encompass
                        the most effective use of its information, educational and cultural
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>“It has been said that creative men build private communications agencies,
                        but that businessmen eventually run them. This Commission suggests that
                        creative plans, policies, and programs are as important as effective
                        executive management and administration. Both are necessary. But a balanced
                        view of and attention to short-range operations and long-range forward
                        planning are also both necessary.</p>
                    <p>“The occasion of the third major confrontation between the United States and
                        the U.S.S.R. is a good time for the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        and the U.S. Government to review the role of the ideological, information
                        or psychological arm of the government. The purpose of such a review would
                        be to further strengthen its assets and capabilities, shore up and improve
                        its gaps and vulnerabilities, and introduce a strong, effective, forward
                        planning operation which would provide new ideas and a more carefully
                        studied long-range stability to the total U.S. communications effort.</p>
                    <p>“Another reason for the creation of a small forward planning unit, which as
                        its first task might well start and conduct such a review, may be found in
                        the criticisms of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.” (Ibid., pages
                        18–20)</p>
                    <p>Following discussion of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s critics,
                        forward planning, and world communications, the report presented the
                        Commission’s conclusions:</p>
                    <p>“In summary, the Commission believes that the Cuban crisis opened a new phase
                        in the cold war and placed new responsibilities on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“The Commission has considered the present role, functions and operations of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. It suggests that five important
                        problems require attention. They are:</p>
                    <p>“1. The need to improve management in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                        >USIA</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>“2. The need to reduce the number of publications that are no longer
                        useful;</p>
                    <p>“3. The need to initiate annual or semi-annual reviews of program output by
                        committees whose membership would include outside experts on print and
                        radio;</p>
                    <p>“4. The need to review the expanding programs in Africa and Latin
                        America;</p>
                    <p>“5. The need for one <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> building in
                        Washington in order to improve the Agency’s operating efficiency and
                        management.</p>
                    <p>“This report has also included the major recommendations and observations of
                        the Chairman’s report on Africa. In a continent of many <pb n="266"
                            facs="0303" xml:id="pg_266"/>nations, tribes and languages, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cannot assume that techniques and
                        material that have proved suitable in European or other areas are equally
                        effective in Africa. The media support programs for Africa should be
                        reviewed in order to assure that media products are tailored to the
                        problems, interests and conditions in Africa.</p>
                    <p>“Latin America represents an important challenge that must be met. The entire
                        economy is an explosive one. Population increases steadily. Demands to
                        reduce poverty, ignorance and illness have increased. Such conditions are
                        ripe for the Communist agitator and organizer. This must be understood by
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in the context of the promise of
                        the Alliance for Progress. Exposure of short and long-range Communist goals
                        for Latin American countries especially as they were manifested by the
                        Russian build-up in Cuba, is an additional task for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“The Commission is pleased to report that a reappraisal of the Agency’s
                        programs in Western Europe has been initiated by the Director. Its purpose
                        is to redefine the role of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in Europe
                        in the light of the emergence of the European Community as a prosperous and
                        powerful force in international affairs.</p>
                    <p>“The Commission has traced the changing role and mission of the foreign
                        information programs during the past 15 years. These have fluctuated with
                        different national strategies and with the experience and orientation of
                        different directors who guided and directed the program.</p>
                    <p>“The Commission believes that the Agency has both short-range and long-range
                        objectives. Although <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has received
                        national praise for its performance in the Cuban crisis, there is a need to
                        develop longer range plans in the light of cumulative criticism of the
                        Agency’s role and approach to the cold war and in recognition of the fact
                        that the U.S.–U.S.S.R. confrontation in Cuba has opened a new phase of this
                        war.</p>
                    <p>“The Commission has recommended that the Agency establish a high level
                        forward-planning unit staffed with its most senior officers. This staff
                        should deal responsibly with these criticisms and with the new challenges
                        and opportunities ushered in by the recent crisis in Cuba and the Chinese
                        Communist invasion of India.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, the Commission suggests that the implications and repercussions of
                        TELSTAR, the American communications satellite, may be as far-reaching as
                        the discovery of atomic energy and the explorations of space. It is
                        important to the national interest that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> exploit and develop this opportunity to the fullest. To do
                        so effectively will require additional research into the opinions,
                        attitudes, misconceptions, taste, and interests of foreign audiences.</p>
                    <p>“With the assistance, support, and understanding of the Congress, this new
                        mighty instrument of international mass communications can <pb n="267"
                            facs="0304" xml:id="pg_267"/>be used to educate and inform the peoples
                        of the world about each other. It will enable the United States to
                        disseminate accurate and authoritative information about its policies,
                        people, and intentions throughout a medium that will have a powerful impact
                        on the peoples of the world. It will demonstrate vividly the goals of the
                        United States and the achievements of free men everywhere.” (Ibid., pages

                            reveals that Laos’ communist Minister of Information, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi Vongvichit</persName>, wrote a letter to
                            the leftward leaning “neutralist” Minister of Foreign Affairs, Quinim
                            Pholsena, on November 29 stating that the U.S. proposal to establish a
                            troika committee, with an American observer, to supervise output of the
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDUSAID_1">USAID</gloss>-supported Lao Photo
                            Press is “flagrant interference in Lao internal affairs and constitutes
                            unacceptable conditions.” Vongvichit added that, if the U.S. proposes to
                            give the printing plant to the Lao Government as aid, there should be an
                            official turnover; if, on the other hand, the U.S. “insists on keeping
                            this establishment as its property, this should be clearly understood so
                            that the Information Ministry can take appropriate measures at the
                            appropriate time.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi Vongvichit</persName> started his move
                            to gain control of U.S.-supplied radio and press facilities two months
                            ago. On October 11 Vongvichit had Premier Souvanna Phouma write a letter
                            to our ambassador<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Not found. <persName

                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>, and demanding that the plant either
                            be turned over entirely to the communist-controlled Ministry of
                            Information or retained entirely by the U.S. Government for its use. The
                            ambassador countered with a proposal to Souvanna that a tri-partite
                            editorial board representing the three Lao factions be formed to pass on
                            output, and that an American observer work with the board. The
                            alternative would have been to turn the printing facility over to the
                            communist minister, which Souvanna indicated he didn’t want any more
                            than we did.</p>
                        <p>Although the principal output of the Lao Photo Press, a weekly pictorial
                            newspaper published in the name of the Ministry of Information, has
                            followed a strictly neutral line, this has not satisfied <persName
                                corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi</persName>
                            <pb n="269" facs="0306" xml:id="pg_269"/>Vongvichit. He wants the plant
                            for himself. There are as yet no reports of another official demarche
                            from the Lao regarding the printing plant, but it can be expected in the
                            near future.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi Vongvichit</persName> already has
                            rather effective control of the Lao Government’s mimeographed daily
                            newspaper and the Lao National Radio facilities in Vientiane, but is so
                            far using them with some caution and not employing them for blatant
                            pro-communist propaganda. The radio stations in Luang Prabang,
                            Savannakhet and Pakse are still in the hands of right-wing supporters of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PN_1">Phoumi Nosavan</persName>, and are
                            following a very moderate line. Radio Pathet Lao, located in the
                            northeastern province of Sam Neua, of course, continues to broadcast the
                            communist line and is violently anti-American. The “Radio of the Laotian
                            Kingdom,” located in Souvanna’s former headquarters at Khang Khay in
                            Xieng Khouang Province, is supposed to be under Souvanna’s control, but
                            has usually been far more left than neutral. The Lao Government has just
                            signed an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            under which the Soviets are to provide a 50 KW radio station to
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>If pressures regarding the Lao Photo Press become too strong, there may
                            be no alternative but to turn it over to the Lao Government. However, in
                            planning for this contingency <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDUSAID_1">USAID</gloss> in Vientiane have
                            already arranged to keep a minimum of supplies on hand. Therefore, a
                            cutoff of supplies and a withdrawal of American and Filipino technicians
                            who have been operating the plant could virtually immobilize it in short
                            order.</p>
                        <p>Communist pressures are also increasing in the field of U.S. aid. The
                            communists, after repeated stalling on approval of the new U.S. proposal
                            to channel most of our aid through a “commodity import program,”<note

                            communists), rather than through the various pertinent ministries, as in
                            the past. Communist pressures have even brought Souvanna Phouma to the
                            point of asking our ambassador if we could change the name of our <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> mission. What’s more, our ambassador
                            is even considering doing so. What the communists are really after is to
                            make it impossible for the U.S. to give aid to the coalition government,
                            thereby making it dependent almost entirely upon bloc countries for
                            economic support.</p>

                                anti-Communist, and neutralist factions under the leadership of
                                Prince Souvanna Phouma.</note> at least in part because nobody else
                            has indicated a capacity to take the reins. The communists have so far
                            usually employed peaceful methods to gain control, and seem to be doing
                            quite well at it. They will of course use force if they deem it
                            necessary. As things are going now, they will get the country by
                            default.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. put its money on Souvanna Phouma as the only hope for a
                            coalition government. As a result:</p>
                        <p>a) The U.S. has withdrawn its military advisory group and has virtually
                            terminated military assistance, but the Viet Minh forces remain.</p>
                        <p>b) Communist pressures, plus Souvanna’s weakness, have kept discussions
                            of a U.S.-financed commodity import program bogged down for several
                            months, and the Lao Government has gotten little else but a $2 million
                            cash grant from the U.S. since the coalition was formed (we formerly
                            provided a <hi rend="italic">monthly</hi> cash grant of $2 to $3
                            million).</p>
                        <p>c) The communists are progressively gaining control of the country’s
                            information media.</p>

                        importance of the theme is such, however, that it merits continuing
                        reiteration by means of all the resources at your command, along the
                        following lines:</p>
                    <p>(1) In output to audiences behind the Iron Curtain, and particularly for
                        young people and intellectuals there, make ample use of materials designed

                    <p>B. In view of Soviet and Cuban propaganda efforts to distort history to their
                        own advantage, continue to keep the record straight by stressing the
                        following themes specifically related to the missile crisis:</p>
                    <p>(1) The Soviet Union, with the complicity and acquiescence of the Cuban
                        Communist regime, posed a threat to the peace and security of the Western
                        Hemisphere and attempted to upset the balance of power by secretly placing
                        offensive weapons systems in Cuba with capacity to wreak nuclear havoc on
                        large areas of North, Central and South America.</p>
                    <p>(2) U.S. strength and firmness were central factors in making the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> back out of Cuba. The U.S. acted calmly
                        and forcefully but left room for a solution short of war, and the Soviet
                        Union demonstrated its respect for U.S. power.</p>
                    <p>(3) The free nations of the Western Hemisphere, acting collectively under the
                        Rio Treaty,<note n="6" xml:id="d105fn6">The Rio Treaty, officially the
                            Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, was initially signed by
                            19 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and
                            Argentina, on September 2, 1947, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The treaty
                            committed its signatories to providing assistance to meet armed
                            attacks.</note> were unanimous in strong action to meet the Soviet
                        threat. The Council of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, in its
                        Resolution of October 23,<note n="7" xml:id="d105fn7">For the text of the
                            resolution, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,

                        dismantling and withdrawal from Cuba of all missiles and other weapons with
                        offensive capability and recommended that the member states take all
                        measures to ensure that the Government of Cuba cannot continue to receive
                        from the Sino-Soviet powers military materiel and related supplies which may
                        threaten the peace and security of the Continent and to prevent the missiles
                        in Cuba with offensive capability from ever becoming an active threat to the
                        peace and security of the Continent. The <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss> stand was another key factor in inducing the Soviet Union
                        to withdraw its weapons from Cuba. The Rio Treaty and all other collective
                        arrangements of the inter-American system remain in full force.</p>
                    <p>(4) Cuba is no longer independent. It is a communist outpost in the
                        Hemisphere. The offensive weapons were installed to serve Soviet purposes;
                        they were controlled by the Soviets; they were removed by the Soviets as a
                        result of negotiations between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. <pb n="274" facs="0311" xml:id="pg_274"/>At one time
                        Castro claimed the IL–28 bombers were Cuban property; he had to reverse
                        himself completely on this point. The crisis demonstrated Castro’s contempt
                        for the welfare of the Cuban people by putting them, without their
                        knowledge, in danger of nuclear destruction. And it demonstrated the
                        untrustworthiness of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as a friend
                        or ally.</p>
                    <p>(5) U.S. statesmanship won out. By mounting a limited quarantine, the U.S.
                        displayed its traditional respect for human life and values. The quarantine
                        was intended to keep out offensive weapons only, not food or medicine or
                        other commodities.</p>
                    <p>C. Withdrawal of offensive Soviet weapons from Cuba has not solved the
                        problem of the presence in Cuba of a Communist dictatorship, or the use of
                        Cuba as a base for Communist subversion and aggression. The continued
                        presence in Cuba of approximately 17,000 Soviet military personnel—some
                        4,000 to 5,000 in organized troop units—constitutes a continuing
                        unacceptable intervention of foreign military power in the hemisphere. On
                        the subject of this long-term problem, use the following themes:</p>
                    <p>(1) The Cuban people deserve the right of self-determination and free choice
                        no less than the people of other nations. Some day Cubans will be free,
                        despite the presence of Soviet troops and weapons in Cuba. As the President
                        said December 29, “All over the island of Cuba, in the government itself . .
                        . there are many who are determined to restore . . . freedom so that the
                        Cuban people may once more govern themselves.”<note n="8" xml:id="d105fn8"
                            >President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> made these
                            remarks on December 29, 1962, at the Orange Bowl in Miami during the
                            presentation of the flag of the Cuban Invasion Brigade, which carried
                            out the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba on April 17, 1961. For the
                            text of <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s address, see

                            911–913.</note></p>
                    <p>(2) The U.S. supports “the right of every free people to freely transform the
                        economic and political institutions of society so that they may serve the
                        welfare of all.”<note n="9" xml:id="d105fn9">See <ref target="#d106fn8"
                                >footnote 8</ref>, above.</note> The U.S. does not favor a return to
                        the status quo ante in Cuba, nor does it oppose revolutionary reform; on the
                        contrary, the Alliance for Progress is based on the necessity for social and
                        economic reform. What the U.S. opposes is Communist expansion and
                        tyranny.</p>
                    <p>(3) Castro betrayed a legitimate national revolution to anti-nationalist
                        communism. He did this deliberately and at breakneck speed. The accusation
                        that the United States pushed Cuba into the arms of the Soviet Union ignores
                        the fact that the U.S. took no economic action against Cuba (e.g., cutting
                        off the sugar quota) until after the Cuban regime had placed itself at the
                        service of international communism.</p>
                    <p><pb n="275" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_275"/>(4) The continuing economic decline
                        and the dismal economic prospects of the Cuban regime, in many cases
                        confirmed by the regime’s own spokesmen, demonstrate the failure of the
                        Cuban experiment in communism and the hollowness of communism’s promises. A
                        steady flow of refugees (from all walks of life, not just the well-to-do)
                        fleeing communism appears wherever communism establishes itself. Cuba is no
                        exception; its living standards have declined steadily since the Castro
                        takeover in 1959. The Soviet pattern of relations with its satellites—to
                        take more than it gives—is reproduced in the case of Cuba, which is to play
                        the part of a supplier of agricultural and mineral raw materials in the
                        Communist world.</p>
                    <p>(5) The <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> has found the Cuban communist
                        regime to be “incompatible with the principles and objectives of the
                        inter-American system.”<note n="10" xml:id="d105fn10">The quote is taken

                        systematically violated <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> principles of
                        non-intervention and self-determination by attempting to export its
                        revolution through violence and subversion, violating human rights, and
                        ignoring the right of people to express their will through unrestricted
                        suffrage.</p>
                    <p>(6) The <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> finding was against the
                        Communist regime, not the people of Cuba. The finding occurred at the Punta
                        del Este Conference in January, 1962; it had nothing to do with the Soviet
                        arms buildup in July–October, 1962. The termination of the missile crisis
                        has not changed the conditions which led the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss> to declare the Cuban regime incompatible with the
                        inter-American system and, in fact, points up the correctness of that <gloss
                            target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> action.</p>
                    <p>(7) The permanent existence of a Communist regime in the Americas is
                        intolerable to the free nations of the hemisphere. Cuba represents a
                        hemispheric problem which requires hemispheric solution. This is no
                        U.S.-Cuban dispute but a calculated, determined effort in Moscow and Havana
                        to subvert and destroy Latin American governments and the inter-American
                        system. The role of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> has therefore
                        been, and will continue to be, of crucial importance. Measures taken to
                        isolate the Cuban regime (economic sanctions, voluntary, unilateral or
                        through the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, for example) stem from the
                        action of the Communist regime which, as the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss> conference at Punta del Este expressed it, “voluntarily
                        placed itself outside the inter-American system.”</p>

                        output to Latin America, attempt to wound the vanity of Fidel Castro by

                        the same time, continue to use satire and ridicule where feasible.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>One of our problems in dealing with other countries is in a very real sense a
                        psychological one. It concerns the way we treat some of our friends who are
                        not great powers and not the source of regular <pb n="280" facs="0317"
                            xml:id="pg_280"/>trouble. Even more important, perhaps, than the way we
                        treat them is the way in which they think we regard them.</p>
                    <p>There is considerable justification, I think, for the strong feeling in such
                        countries that we take them for granted. They tend to believe that we pay
                        attention to them only when they cause trouble or when we need their
                        support, in votes at the U.N., for example. We focus our attention—in
                        statements, in actions, even in our choice of travel—on the big countries,
                        the economically strong countries, or the troublesome countries.</p>
                    <p>We all know, of course, that we cannot pay equal attention to all countries
                        or governments. It is only natural that we concentrate on major forces in
                        the world and on those areas or countries likely to be the source of
                        important difficulties. I am wondering, however, whether we might not be
                        able to strike something of a better balance.</p>
                    <p>To cite a few examples:</p>
                    <p>Compare the number of times that Japan has been mentioned in major statements
                        of U.S. policy during the past year with the mentions of Korea, the
                        Philippines or the Republic of China. How many leading Americans have
                        visited Japan in the past year compared with the number that spent some time
                        conveying our thoughts and our friendship to the other Asian states?</p>
                    <p>The Pakistanis long have thought we were slighting them, despite their
                        alliance with us and their public identification with our policies. How much
                        of the present trouble in that area is based on their deep feeling that we
                        really have always considered India far more important?</p>
                    <p>About 98 per cent of our time, attention, and statements in the European area
                        are centered on Britain, France and Germany. Belgium gets into the act when
                        there is a Congo crisis. But when did we last give the Turks an approving
                        pat on the back? When was the last time a public figure visited Norway? Or
                        the Netherlands? Or Austria (except to meet <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>)?</p>
                    <p>Cuba excepted, how much of our concentration on Latin American affairs has
                        centered on big, admittedly important, troublesome Brazil? What about Chile?
                        Or Costa Rica? Or Colombia?</p>
                    <p>There are any number of ways in which we might do better in dealing with
                        small and usually untroublesome countries. We might even find that doing so
                        would tend to lessen their proclivity to make trouble, who knows? We might,
                        for example, go out of our way—in a Presidential or Secretarial news
                        conference—to praise something positive done by this country or that. We
                        might encourage our leading officials to visit one or another of the
                        countries that rarely receive such attention. We might deliberately raise
                        the level of attention given distinguished visitors from such countries. We
                        might seek to open a <pb n="281" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_281"/>dialogue
                        outside normal channels with a man like <persName corresp="#p_SPN_1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName>, or Hussein, or <persName corresp="#p_YAF_1"
                            >Youlou</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I think this is something we might give some attention. If we devoted thought
                        to this, I daresay we would produce half a dozen useful ideas in each area.
                        By the end of 1963, we should be able to point to some positive efforts by
                        way of praising and promoting our smaller but not unimportant friends.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Don:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Thank you for your note of January 15th and the policy statement of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in re Cuba.<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2"
                            >A copy of <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName>’s note is
                            ibid. The policy statement is presumably <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> News Policy Note No. 2–63. A copy is ibid.</note></p>
                    <p>I was very interested in this policy statement and found it helpful. I guess
                        I maybe become a little overexcited about the importance of policy
                        concerning Cuba as well as our often-repeated position to Castro and all his
                        works.</p>
                    <p>It is still my view that a few more policy statements need to be made not
                        only by the President but by other important officials of our government
                        concerning the hopes and aspirations that we have for the Cuban people. The
                        friends of democracy in Latin America need to know that we not only oppose
                        tyranny and Communism, but that we also actively support and champion
                        freedom and democracy. We are rightly proud of our great military strength
                        and the fact that we were able to face up to the Soviet military challenge
                        and compel the Russian dictator to back down. To me, however, the United
                        States is more than a military power. It is a living manifestation of the
                        hopes and aspirations of people who yearn for freedom. We must never forget
                        the importance <pb n="282" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_282"/>of the idealistic,
                        the spiritual, the political, and the social factors in this struggle with
                        the Communists.</p>
                    <p>This is just another way of saying that I think we need to do more of what
                        was stated on page four<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">In his January 15 note

                        official policy pronouncements, both classified and unclassified.</p>
                    <p>2. Agency activities should (a) encourage constructive public support abroad
                        for the goal of a “peaceful world community of free and independent states,
                        free to choose their own future and their own system so long as it does not

                    <p>As you are well aware, Laos’ problems continue. The Communists are attempting
                        to secure the political control of the areas they now occupy and to thwart
                        any implementation of the Geneva Agreements<note n="5" xml:id="d110fn5">The
                            Geneva Agreements of July 23, 1962, brought to a close the hostilities
                            between left and right wing factions in Laos. It called for the country
                            to become neutral and for the formation of a tripartite government that
                            represented the conflicting factions. It also authorized the
                            International Control Commission to observe violations of the agreement.
                            The agreement, however, did not hold and the situation in Laos continued
                            to deteriorate over the course of 1963. For documentation on the

                    <p>Our efforts, on the other hand, are aimed at building neutralist and
                        conservative support for Prince Souvanna Phouma, and working through the

                        achieve the implementation of the Geneva Agreements. To this end, we are
                        encouraging the <gloss target="#t_ICC_1">ICC</gloss> to increase its
                        activity in making unrestricted investigations of areas known to contain
                        Vietnamese troop concentrations. The going is slow but we are making some
                        headway and the first investigations, limited though they were, have been
                        made. We have hopes that further investigations at Canadian-Indian
                        initiative will be undertaken shortly.</p>
                    <p><pb n="286" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_286"/>The formation of the new coalition
                        government in Laos made it mandatory that we re-examine our aid program to
                        Laos in order to assure that the funds would not be used by the Pathet Lao
                        or for purposes other than those intended. As a result of our re-examination
                        last summer, we decided that the most effective way to provide financial aid
                        to the new government would be a commodity import program by which the U.S.
                        would pay for the costs of essential Lao imports. Accordingly, we have
                        revised our program and have entered into negotiations with the Lao.
                        Partially because of inherent delays in organizing a new program and
                        partially because of Lao hesitation and reluctance to accept certain
                        necessary but very mild controls (which incidentally was as strong among the
                        conservative elements as the left) it has taken considerable time to
                        negotiate. However, as you probably have noted from the newspapers,<note

                        delays. During the period of negotiations the U.S. has continued to provide
                        financial assistance to the Lao government. Since July 1962, 7 million
                        dollars have been placed in the Federal Reserve Bank for use under the new
                        commodity import program, and at the same time, project assistance has been
                        continued without significant interruption.</p>
                    <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDE_1">Moore</persName> points out in his

                        been attempting to take over control of all radio and press facilities in
                        the country. Our policy, consistent with our overall objectives outlined
                        above has been, where possible, to block the Communist’s take over of
                        important informational facilities and to encourage the continuation of
                        their use in the support of Souvanna Phouma and the neutralist leadership of
                        the coalition government. As Minister of Information, however, <persName

                        recent efforts that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDE_1">Moore</persName> is
                        able to say that the Minister “is so far using them with some caution and
                        not employing them for blatant pro-communist propaganda.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi Vongvichit</persName> has also been trying
                        to gain control of the U.S. supported Lao Photo Press and the <hi
                            rend="italic">Khao Phap Hob Sapda</hi> which is the weekly pictorial
                        news bulletin published by the press. While the <pb n="287" facs="0324"
                            xml:id="pg_287"/>Country Team has been careful not to use them in any
                        way which could be criticised by the Communists, these two operations have
                        been extremely effective in providing support to Souvanna Phouma. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDE_1">Moore</persName>’s memorandum describes
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi Vongvichit</persName>’s intention to
                        force the U.S. to either turn the press over to the <gloss target="#t_RLG_1"
                            >RLG</gloss> (i.e. the Ministry of Information) or make it clear that it
                        is still the property of the U.S. so that the Ministry of Information can
                        take “appropriate steps at the appropriate time.” While <persName
                            corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi</persName>’s threats are vague (primarily
                        because the physical location of the press in conservative controlled
                        Vientiane makes a Communist takeover at this time extremely difficult) they
                        must be met and countered. By a variety of measures the Country Team in
                        Vientiane has so far succeeded in meeting these threats and in preventing
                        the takeover of the press by the Communists. Moreover, in anticipation of a
                        possible Communist takeover the Country Team has arranged to limit the
                        amount of supplies kept on hand at the press. In case the Communists do take
                        it over, limited supplies and the withdrawal of U.S. technical assistance
                        will stop the press at least until bloc technicians and supplies can replace
                        our own. In an effort to find a satisfactory long range solution to this
                        problem, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS_1">Unger</persName> has
                        suggested to Souvanna Phouma the formation of a tripartite committee with an
                        American observer to supervise the output of the press. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi Vongvichit</persName> naturally opposes this
                        because it would not give him unfettered control of the press but Souvanna
                        has taken rather well to the idea.</p>
                    <p>The success of our efforts to achieve a stable and neutral Laos and to so
                        avoid a costly war under disadvantageous conditions will, of course, depend
                        a great deal on our success in stiffening and bolstering the Prime Minister.
                        Souvanna must be encouraged to take firm control of the coalition and we
                        must be flexible enough to provide him quickly with the assistance he needs
                        to deal with the Pathet Lao. In this effort we will need all of our
                        resources and cannot be hamstrung by mere name and form. If it will better
                        achieve our objectives to change the name of <gloss target="#t_USOM_1"
                            >USOM</gloss> (our <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> mission in Laos)
                        or the Air America Corporation (our air supply organization) then we must be
                        willing to consider it and if necessary do it quickly.</p>
                    <p>We are involved in what I believe will be a long and frustrating series of
                        battles with people like <persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi
                            Vongvichit</persName> and Quinim. We will succeed if we continue to work
                        with all the means at our disposal to stiffen Souvanna and block the
                        Communist’s attempts to expand their position at the expense of the
                        conservatives and neutralists. An extremely important factor in preventing
                        the Pathet Lao from resorting to open warfare to achieve its goals is the
                        Soviet Union’s concern least the struggle in Laos escalate into something
                        larger. It remains to be seen just how the present Sino-Soviet difficulties
                        will affect this situation <pb n="288" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_288"/>but we
                        have reason to believe that the Soviets desire to keep the struggle on a
                        political basis. The situation is far from resolved and our problems
                        continue; but it is by no means a lost cause as yet.</p>

                        treatment of press. (At his press conference this morning the Secretary

                        general approaches which the Department is suggesting the Embassy in

                        <p>776. Your reports over past several weeks indicate that we are facing
                            stepped-up PL offensive against <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            operations and presence in Laos. This heightened pressure, although not
                            at all unexpected, suggests time may have arrived for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to begin swinging back more sharply in
                            Laos and to indicate publicly that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            patience with PL obstructionism running short. Our purpose in doing so
                            would be to deter PL from its more flagrant tactics, to bring
                            developments in Laos to world attention and to force the “troika”<note

                            intensive efforts and to rally non-communist Lao, particularly so-called
                            conservative wing, to more active defense of their position. Since all
                            of the many extremely complex issues and problems we face in Laos are
                            subjects of almost daily exchanges between Embassy and Dept following
                            lines of action are set forth in broad outline. Intention is to suggest
                            some concepts of “style” rather than propose individual moves. Dept

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. With <persName corresp="#p_PV_1"
                                >Phoumi</persName></p>
                        <p>We have been surprised at how few times <persName corresp="#p_PV_1"
                                >Phoumi</persName> and other conservatives have apparently used
                            their veto to block unfavorable actions within <gloss target="#t_RLG_1"
                                >RLG</gloss>. Recognize, of course, that there are occasions where
                            conservatives have moved quietly to head off PL initiatives which do not
                            come to public attention, but it seems rare for conservatives to come
                            out openly and strongly against a particular PL action. This may be due
                            to emphasis we have placed in our dealings with <persName
                                corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi</persName> on importance of supporting
                            Souvanna which has come to mean in most cases not rpt not opposing those
                            PL moves to which Souvanna is willing agree. However, since Souvanna
                            apparently inclined follow lines of least resistance we believe PL will
                            hold initiative on major problems such as air supply, international
                            relations and freedom of movement until <persName corresp="#p_PV_1"
                                >Phoumi</persName> starts pressing back.</p>
                        <p>We would like to see <persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi</persName> make
                            some public gestures which in effect would veto the PL veto, e.g. insist
                            that there is no rpt no agreement among Lao re air supply and that
                            therefore PL cannot oppose. Admittedly such gestures could not change
                            actual situation or stop PL obstructionism but they could serve to blur
                            PL propaganda, show that conservatives are still active and establish a
                            strong non-Communist Lao position which <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> could support.</p>
                        <p>Another area in which we feel conservatives should be more vocal is in
                            attacking Chicoms and <gloss target="#t_DRV_1">DRV</gloss> for their
                            violations of Agreements<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">Reference is to the

                            and independence. Impression here is that the only Lao propaganda
                            receiving international attention is that directed against <gloss

                            criticism of communist signatories comes only from <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> or other non-Lao sources; <persName

                        <p>Finally we wish allude again to necessity of <persName corresp="#p_PV_1"
                                >Phoumi</persName> using his control of Vientiane and its facilities
                            to force bargains from PL on such matters as air supply. In our view as
                            long as PL deny access by either <pb n="292" facs="0329" xml:id="pg_292"

                                >Phoumi</persName> can be tougher in extracting <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Request Emb’s interpretation whether <persName corresp="#p_PV_1"
                                >Phoumi</persName>’s attitude can be explained as a tactic to
                            extract some commitment of special <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            support for conservative faction.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Souvanna</p>
                        <p>Our general criticism of Souvanna as we have expressed in our messages
                            recently is that he fails to take position of his own on issues where
                            his leadership could be decisive factor. He apparently fails understand
                            that the row of a neutralist is at least as hard to hoe as that of an
                            aligned country. Neutralization does not exempt a country or govt from
                            the necessity to struggle for independence and neutrality is not
                            identical with a supine posture. Souvanna’s attitude may be matter of
                            temperament and character and therefore not particularly amenable to our
                            influence. Recognize also that repeated showdowns with PL on all issues
                            would soon result in complete breakdown of national union govt and that
                            Souvanna must postpone collision on some issues temporarily in order
                            maintain framework his govt. Our problem, therefore, is to identify
                            those issues where slippage would seriously endanger him and convince
                            Souvanna that he must take stand in his own interest or lose out
                            entirely.</p>
                        <p>How to bring him to save himself is primarily tactical matter of which
                            you are of course best judge. However, thought has occurred to us that
                            perhaps Souvanna has come to accept our unfailing support as matter of
                            course whereas he feels that he must placate communists to earn theirs,
                            (e.g. <gloss target="#t_Embtel_1">Embtel</gloss> 1053<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d112fn6">Not found.</note> where Souvanna fusses about size
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDUSAID_1">USAID</gloss> staff while conveniently
                            ignoring several thousand Chicoms and Viet Minh working on roads). It
                            might be useful administer dash of cold water in form of reminders that
                            we can support him only so long as he follows truly neutral path and
                            that certainly we would not accept his back-tracking on understandings
                            with us (e.g. <gloss target="#t_Embtel_1">Embtel</gloss> 1095)<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d112fn7">Not found.</note> without some public
                            reaction. Admittedly it would be hard to get across without discouraging
                            him too greatly but suggest Souvanna should be made to feel he must work
                            for our support also.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. With communist side</p>
                        <p>Essence of foregoing is that we should consider generally raising
                            temperature in Vientiane by encouraging stronger public stands by
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV_1">Phoumi</persName> and Souvanna while
                            toughening our own public posture. This <pb n="293" facs="0330"
                                xml:id="pg_293"/>may mean in turn our taking gloves off when dealing
                            with individual Lao such as Quinim and <persName corresp="#p_PV_1"
                                >Phoumi Vongvichit</persName> and challenging them directly and
                            publicly when they criticize us. It is hard to imagine that we can run
                            into much more trouble with these two than they now give us and it may
                            be that by showing our irritation with them we can encourage reaction
                            against them by Lao themselves.</p>

                        <p>While we obviously would not rpt not wish place final control of our

                            hands we see merit in allowing French take lead publicly whenever their

                    <p>We are becoming increasingly concerned over what we see as the failure of
                        Agency output to pay enough attention to the task of projecting an
                        integrated American society. Ten percent of the population is Negro. Another
                        significant percentage is non-white. Various top officials, including the
                        Attorney General, have stated that racial issues are of primary importance
                        overseas. Therefore I believe that no serious effort by this Agency on any
                        theme or campaign should fail to take this task into account.</p>

                        to project world-wide, in a constant “soft sell” manner, the basic idea of
                        an integrated society in which non-whites are playing an increasing

                    <p>We have just assembled information on Western European reaction to the U.S.
                        domestic political controversy.</p>
                    <p>In summary, concern with the Administration’s domestic predicaments as
                        related to foreign affairs was generally restricted to elite media.
                        Editorial comment was sparse ranging from fairly heavy in Britain to
                        practically none in Italy. Available comment indicated awareness of the
                        various aspects and factors impinging on the position of the Administration
                        and general sympathy for it. Nowhere were charges of immaturity levelled
                        against the Administration; however, there was some criticism of the
                        Administration for heavy-handedness in dealing with allies. Such dealings
                        were often said to be based too much on cold logic devoid of regard for
                        human factors. Most media related the present domestic hassle over Cuba to
                        Republican pressures which were often either obliquely or directly
                        castigated. In some instances, however, it was pointed out that individual
                        members of the Administration were partially responsible for conflicting
                        views on the status of the Cuba situation. Doubts were also expressed in
                        several cases as to the accuracy of intelligence information made available
                        by the Administration. Its specific measures taken at this time against Cuba
                        were widely <pb n="296" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_296"/>regarded as temporizing
                        and even ineffective, but there was no indication that the bulk of European
                        opinion would favor stronger measures against Castro. Rather, the moderation
                        of the Administration was welcomed, although in some as yet isolated cases
                        it was held that the President had lost the initiative in the Cuban
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Conservative <hi rend="italic">Le Figaro</hi>, Paris, probably spoke for much
                        of public opinion in Western Europe, when it stated “it must be hoped that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> will succeed in
                        extricating himself from the maze of difficulties and disillusionment into
                        which recent events seemed to have plunged him.” Some of the difficulties
                        alluded to were seen by the more critical commentators as caused by the
                        Administration’s handling of the European and Canadian rather than the Cuban
                        crisis. Resentment still lingers over lack of prior consultation in the
                        October crisis and was fanned in France, Belgium and occasionally West
                        Germany by the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> crisis.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d114fn2">Reference is to the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis
                            and France’s refusal to accept the United Kingdom into the European
                            Economic Community.</note> More recently, some British papers took
                        offense at the alleged interference of the State Department in Canadian
                            affairs.<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">On January 30, the Department of
                            State issued a statement on the ongoing negotiations between the United
                            States and Canada on the issue of provision of nuclear weapons for
                            Canadian forces in the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis. The
                            statement reads, in part: “These discussions have been exploratory in
                            nature; the Canadian Government has not as yet proposed any arrangement
                            sufficiently practical to contribute effectively to North American
                            defense.” For the full text of the statement, see <ref

                            the Department of State with an “unwarranted intrusion in Canadian
                            affairs.” (Raymond Daniell, “Canadian Denounce U.S. on Defense

                        nationalism in countries that feel threatened by Yankee dictation.” Other
                        comment censored the reputed high-handedness of the Administration in
                        dealing with its allies rather than reserving this kind of treatment for
                        their enemies. Some British and French dailies pointed to a deficiency of
                        “cultural empathy” on the highest level of the Administration.</p>
                    <p>More specifically, individual members of the Administration were charged with
                        either precipitating in part the present domestic crisis or not succeeding
                        in convincing their opponents. Attorney-General <persName corresp="#p_KRF_1"

                        in several instances for “clumsiness” and confusing the issues. But even in
                        this instance there was no single reference to immaturity or even

                        had eagerly seized the opportunity to harass the Administration. In a number

                        that the “Republicans do not want to be convinced that the Cuba threat has
                        been removed as they need it as a club to hold over the <persName

                        consensus that such actions would do little to further embarrass Castro and
                        even less to conciliate domestic opposition to the Administration. Yet
                        little as these measures might do to heighten tensions in the Caribbean,
                        anxieties were already expressed in the form of hopes that Washington would

                    <p>Opinion was agreed that the Cuban situation remained potentially dangerous
                        and that Cuba continued to constitute a Communist springboard for
                        operations, political rather than military. The Administration was seen as
                        marking time in order to avoid a new upsurge of tension, but in so doing
                        some papers thought it possible that the “<persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"

                            also broadcast on major radio networks. The networks broadcast the
                            interview under the title, “After Two Years—A Conversation with the

                    <p>“In itself, the interview was an absorbing drama . . . President <persName

                        and failure he had encountered. His own analysis of each situation about

                            >Evening Post</hi>, New Zealand.</p>
                    <p>“I now feel that television must be just about unbeatable for presenting

                    <p>“It was most impressive. No doubt the strongest impression was created by the

                        spoke of the responsibility for the national interests of the U.S. and the

                    <p>“The charm of the American President is able to radiate on his television

                        countries (guideline 2, <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> 5573); and (c)
                        render temporary assistance now—from “unspecified source”—to those students

                    <p>As for the whereabouts of the students, the attitudes of the <gloss

                        African embassies in western Europe, we know little more today than we did
                        yesterday. The Department has sent a query to African posts for their
                        reactions to the situation from that vantage point.</p>
                    <p>In the judgment of the people in the Department who follow such things, the
                        African students in Bulgaria probably came “from the bottom of the barrel”,
                        are far less qualified than other African students in the bloc, and would
                        almost certainly not qualify for attendance at a university in the west.
                        This looks like a crop that would be much better off back in Africa. The
                        leader of the revolt already has said from Czechoslovakia that he wishes to
                        return to Ghana.</p>

                        authorizes the President to provide for “United States participation in
                        international fairs and expositions abroad, including trade and industrial
                        fairs and other public or private demonstrations of United States economic
                        accomplishments and cultural attainments.” Thus this activity, known as the
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Trade Fair Exhibition program, is
                        a part of the total U.S. effort to influence public attitudes in support of
                        U.S. foreign policy objectives in the country where an exhibition is staged.
                        The theme and content of each exhibition should be directly related to, and
                        clearly support, the purpose of the Act as set forth in its Section 101, the
                        U.S. objectives set forth in the Department of State’s “Guidelines for
                        Policy and Operations” paper for the country, and the <gloss

                    <p>Section 101 of the Act states:</p>
                    <p>“The purpose of this Act is to enable the Government of the United States to
                        increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and
                        the people of other countries by means of educational <pb n="303"

                        ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and
                        cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the
                        United States and other nations, and the contributions being made toward a
                        peaceful and more fruitful life for people throughout the world; to promote
                        international cooperation for educational and cultural advancement; and thus
                        to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic, and peaceful
                        relations between the United States and the other countries of the
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>In line with the U.S. Government’s policy to promote exports as a means of
                        sustaining U.S. foreign policy objectives, the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> program should include the promotion of international
                        trade and expansion of U.S. exports insofar as this can be done within the
                        psychological objectives stated above.</p>

                    <p>As per Section 6 of the Executive Order, “the Secretary of State shall

                    <p>The Director of the U.S. Information Agency has again asked the Commerce

                    <p>Similar coordination among agency and departmental representatives is

                        WORLD</p>
                    <p>For a short while this evening, I will have you at something of a
                        disadvantage. During the next fifteen or twenty minutes, I shall be involved
                        in what is essentially a monologue. I am supposed to talk and you are
                        supposed to listen. (The married men in this audience will have long since
                        adjusted to this kind of situation. And the single men might as well get
                        some practice.) But when I finish my remarks, and we get into a question and
                        answer period, my advantage will disappear.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the give and take of questions and answers will put us on reasonably
                        equal grounds. Obviously, you will then be able to ask questions about
                        matters that are important to you, matters which may <pb n="305" facs="0342"
                            xml:id="pg_305"/>or may not have been covered in my remarks.
                        Furthermore, your questions will derive from your precise knowledge—or lack
                        of it—concerning the work of the U.S. Information Agency; or, at the very
                        least, they will be triggered by something I have said but did not develop
                        fully.</p>
                    <p>So the exchange may very well prove to be more meaningful to you than my
                        remarks. (But since no one could reasonably be expected to pass up the
                        opportunity of an uninterrupted speech, I’ll persist in speaking.)</p>
                    <p>In any event, I have noted the contrast between a speech and a dialogue to
                        establish a point that is fundamental to the operations of the Agency which
                        I represent: that an exchange of views is more likely to result in
                        successful communication between individuals—or nations—than is a unilateral
                        exposition of one view.</p>
                    <p>It would be worthwhile, before I elaborate on this point, to define the role
                        of the United States Information Agency. Because his is the best definition
                        I have yet seen, I will quote Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1"
                            >Murrow</persName>: “We seek,” he said, “to make the policies and
                        practices of this government and this people everywhere intelligible and
                        wherever possible palatable.”<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2"><persName
                                corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> is quoting <persName
                                corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>’s statement made during the
                            March 14, 1961, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing regarding
                                <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>’s nomination to be

                    <p>There are some interesting aspects of this definition that deserve
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>First of all, you will notice the very direct relationship between the
                        foreign policies of this nation and the role of the Agency. For that reason,
                        and more than ever before, the views of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> concerning these policies are heard during the policy
                        formulation process. In effect, we are increasingly able to make our views
                        known before the policies we will be asked to make intelligible are actually
                        established.</p>
                    <p>The second aspect of our role I want to call to your attention lies in the
                        use of the word “intelligible” before the word “palatable.” There was a
                        time, in the early days of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, when the
                        emphasis seemed to be on the word “love.” For that matter, we Americans
                        still seem to be curiously addicted to being loved throughout the world; we
                        have a strange sense of disappointment when we find that not all people love
                        all things American all of the time. “Gratitude” is another word that is
                        brought into play when we try to assess the stance of foreign nations.
                        Americans travelling abroad frequently ask our foreign service officers with
                        whom they come in contact such questions as: “Are the people <pb n="306"
                            facs="0343" xml:id="pg_306"/>here grateful for our aid? Do they
                        appreciate everything we’re doing for them? Are they aware of our
                        generosity?”</p>
                    <p>It would be nice, of course, if slightly unreal, if all nations with whom we
                        are aligned through pacts, common goals, or through common standards of
                        international morality were indeed grateful for our efforts, or felt a warm
                        surge of romance when the United States was mentioned.</p>
                    <p>It would be nice—but it would be relatively unimportant.</p>
                    <p>It is far more worthwhile, far more important to the attainment of our
                        foreign policy objectives, to be clearly understood. Understanding is not an
                        assurance of agreement, but it is an assurance of respect. You and I may
                        argue over an important issue, but we will respect each other’s argument if
                        we understand the reasons underlying it, the logic that created it. So it is
                        with nations.</p>
                    <p>Our emphasis, therefore, in the U.S. Information Agency is to create
                        understanding of our policies, not to play the role of Cupid. Strangely
                        enough, cupidity—a derivative of Cupid—means avarice and greed, not
                        love.</p>
                    <p>We seek, as I said earlier, intelligibility and, where possible,
                        palatability. And it is these words which lead us back to my earlier
                        comments about the dialogue. For no policy of this government can be made
                        intelligible to people that we do not understand. We must know what
                        motivates our audience; we must understand, and respect, the culture, the
                        history, the aspirations, the national interest, the politics and the
                        problems of the people to whom we address ourselves. With this as a basis of
                        the dialogue in which we seek to engage, there can be—and frequently is—an
                        effective exchange, an effective communication of views.</p>
                    <p>And it would all be relatively simple except for the fact that in the process
                        of international communications, we come up against three hard and difficult
                        realities.</p>
                    <p>The first of these complications is that we are seen so differently by so
                        many nations that we cannot talk intelligently about the American image
                        abroad. In each of the more than 100 nations where we work, there is a
                        separate and distinct image of the United States. And why not? Each nation
                        is itself separate and distinct and each has emerged from a distinct
                        background, and each necessarily sees and judges others within its own frame
                        of reference. Some of these nations are wholly literate; some are mostly
                        illiterate. Many view us through the philosophic calm of Buddah or Confucius
                        or through the philosophic detachment of Hinduism. Others are the inheritors
                        of the Christian or Moslem faiths.</p>
                    <p>Within each of these nations, we may find ourselves speaking to communists,
                        socialists or capitalists. And it is inescapable that the monarchist sees us
                        differently than the Marxist.</p>
                    <p><pb n="307" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_307"/>The reverse of this coin is the
                        second of the three major problems in international communications; we
                        ourselves do not project a unified image of America. Which of our many
                        voices is authoritative; which represents the real America; which the common
                        denominator or the consensus?</p>
                    <p>To whom shall the foreign audience listen? To conservative American or
                        liberal; to the northerner or the southerner; to the Democrat or
                        Republican?</p>
                    <p>Is the Federal Government’s strong support of James Meredith’s entry into the
                        University of Mississippi the true picture,<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d95fn2">footnote 2, Document 95</ref>.</note> or does
                        the true picture really consist of riots and demonstrations and racism?</p>
                    <p>Hemingway, Faulkner, <persName corresp="#p_FR_1">Frost</persName>, Whitman—do
                        they speak for America? Or shall we be judged by the racy murder and sex
                        writer whose works are found in the newsstands around the world?</p>
                    <p>The dialogue, you can see, is not nearly as easy to carry on effectively as
                        it may appear at first glance. And we have yet to consider that third most
                        pressing and omnipresent problem of all. I shall have more to say about it
                        later, but let me note for now that we are faced with a worldwide propaganda
                        campaign undertaken by the Soviet Union and the communist apparatus. This
                        voice, by comparison is monolithic. This voice is not bound by truth nor is
                        its audience exposed to an open society on view for the world to see.</p>
                    <p>This, I need not tell you, is a problem of some consequence.</p>
                    <p>How then are all of these problems, these challenges, met? Within the
                        framework of these problems, how does the U.S. Information Agency undertake
                        its tasks?</p>
                    <p>If I may continue for a moment to generalize, we do it in two primary
                        ways.</p>
                    <p>First of all, we use all possible media in communicating with the nations and
                        the people of the world. You are probably most familiar with the Voice of
                        America, our radio complex which only recently nearly doubled its power with
                        a new installation in Greenville, North Carolina,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d118fn4">The new transmitter complex opened on February 8.
                            Remarks by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>,
                            which he recorded earlier that morning at the White House, were
                            broadcast overseas via the new transmitter during the opening ceremony.

                        which broadcasts 740 hours weekly in 38 different languages. We have a press
                        service which radioteletypes 10,000 words a day to all of our posts,
                        bringing them the important policy developments and policy statements. We
                        have a films division and a television <pb n="308" facs="0345"
                            xml:id="pg_308"/>division which, together, reach tens of millions of
                        people yearly. We use books and pamphlets, libraries, exchange programs,
                        English teaching programs, and exhibits.</p>
                    <p>But most of all we use people, our people. For on nothing do we place a
                        greater stress than on personal contacts by our officers in the field.
                        Nothing that we say through any of the media can be really effective without
                        these all-important personal contacts. It is these that produce the
                        dialogue, and it is the dialogue that gives us a deeper insight into the
                        people whom we are trying to convince. Conversely, it is the personal
                        contact that gives these people a deeper and more accurate insight into
                        America and Americans.</p>
                    <p>So it is the very essence of our operations that all of our officers devote
                        themselves, first and foremost, to meeting and talking with the people who
                        constitute our audiences.</p>
                    <p>We are, of course, selective in this audience. We have neither the resources
                        nor the physical capability of reaching everyone. Instead, we single out
                        those groups important to the present or future determination of the
                        policies of their country; or those who can directly influence opinion in
                        their country. We meet with the leaders of government, the opposition
                        leaders, and the editors and publishers. We meet with the student, the
                        teacher, the labor leader, the young intellectual—that group which is
                        usually the core of ferment, particularly in the underdeveloped country.</p>
                    <p>In fact, we emphasize contact with the youth and labor groups, for recent
                        history has demonstrated conclusively and dramatically the unique importance
                        of these two groups, almost everywhere in ferment, looking for new answers
                        to old problems that will no longer be put aside; and in many places capable
                        of changing the course and destiny of their nations.</p>
                    <p>Now it is time to turn from these generalizations to some specifics and I
                        should like to single out, for concrete examples, an area which I know has
                        great interest for you—Latin America. More than anything else in recent
                        history, perhaps, the problem of Cuba has drawn our urgent attention to the
                        problems of all of Latin America.</p>
                    <p>It has also drawn the attention of the Soviet Union, whose propaganda effort
                        in that area is significant in scope. Let me draw from my recent testimony
                        before the Inter-American Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs
                            Committee<note n="5" xml:id="d118fn5"><persName corresp="#p_WDM_1"

                                >Ryan</persName>, and former Prime Minister of Cuba Manuel de Varona
                            also testified. (<hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>, February

                                >Wilson</persName>’s testimony was not found.</note> to give you a
                        quick picture of the Soviet propaganda effort in South America:</p>
                    <p><pb n="309" facs="0346" xml:id="pg_309"/>—In radio, the total Communist
                        effort, including the Cuban, Soviet, European satellites and Chinese
                        shortwave broadcasts, comes to 415 hours of broadcasting a week.</p>
                    <p>—In books, the Soviets alone have boosted their output of Spanish-language
                        titles by more than 30 percent during the past year. In this past year they
                        have put out some 1.5 million books, more than 40 percent of which were
                        overt propaganda.</p>
                    <p>—In the field of periodicals, the Communists leave no audience untouched.
                        Special magazines, generally well-produced, are directed at women, youth,
                        workers, movie fans, and intellectuals.</p>
                    <p>—There are 326 Communist controlled newspapers and periodicals in Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>—Students are a special target of Communist cultural activities, and this
                        attention includes scholarships to study in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>—There are films and speeches and seminars; and, through all media, the
                        distortions and attacks on the policies of the United States.</p>
                    <p>So the number of images which already compound our problem are added to, if
                        not multiplied, by Communist propaganda.</p>
                    <p>What then are we doing in Latin America? Here again, let me draw for you a
                        quick but representative picture:</p>
                    <p>—Two years ago, the Voice of America broadcast in Spanish one hour a day, and
                        not at all in Portuguese. Today we are on the air 12 hours a day to Latin
                        America, nine in Spanish and three in Portuguese.</p>
                    <p>—This may concern you if you remember the figure of 415 hours of broadcasting
                        a week by the Communists. But what I haven’t yet told you is that in Latin
                        America <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is placing 10,000 weekly
                        hours of taped programming on 1500 Latin American stations that are heard in
                        the cities, towns and villages of that continent.</p>
                    <p>—Through our cultural programs in Latin America, we give assistance and
                        support to 119 binational centers in 19 countries. Within the walls of these
                        centers, we teach English, arrange lectures, art exhibits, film programs,
                        concerts, and courses in American literature and culture.</p>
                    <p>—We also maintain 11 regular <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries
                        and information centers which carry on active programs and are the locales
                        for exhibits on such themes as the Alliance for Progress, U.S. space
                        accomplishments, and the broken promises of the Castro regime in Cuba.</p>
                    <p>—Our press file is teletyped in Spanish to all posts except Brazil, which
                        receives it in English and translates it into Portuguese. How is it used? In
                        Mexico, to cite just one example, our post reports placement of 90 percent
                        of the material in Mexican newspapers and magazines. Here again, the themes
                        of this material range from the Alliance for Progress to Castroism, from
                        American art to American science.</p>
                    <p><pb n="310" facs="0347" xml:id="pg_310"/>—In our publications program, we
                        have produced and distributed, amongst other things, eight million copies of
                        six cartoon books on the record of Castro in such fields as education, labor
                        and religion.</p>
                    <p>—Motion pictures add still another dimension to our coverage of Latin
                        America. We have a monthly film magazine covering the continent; we produce
                        documentaries on the Alliance for Progress. We point up the failures of
                        Cuban communism. These films are seen in commercial theaters in the major
                        cities and the small towns; they are screened in special showings for
                        diplomatic and leadership groups; we send projectors and our films to
                        schools, universities and labor unions. In Brazil alone, our films are shown
                        in over 2000 commercial theaters with a combined seating capacity of over
                        1.5 million people.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> television covers Latin America, with
                        an audience that runs to the tens of million. Television is a fast medium
                        and it enables us to move rapidly and effectively. The chronology of the

                    <p>You will recall that on October 22, the President made his address to the

                        countries having videotape facilities. Films and kinescopes covered the

                        Every evening during the crisis, a special five-minute commentary on the <pb
                            n="311" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_311"/>day’s events was air-shipped to our
                        posts in Latin America. A <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> documentary on
                        Cuba went out with multi-language sound tracks. And our weekly <gloss
                            target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> news magazine covered events and highlights.
                        This magazine, incidentally, has a regular weekly audience of over 10
                        million.</p>
                    <p>I told you earlier about our emphasis on youth and labor groups throughout
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America, we now have nine Labor Information Officers utilizing
                        information techniques to build support for democratic solutions to Latin
                        America’s problems, particularly as these solutions are embodied in the
                        Alliance for Progress.</p>
                    <p>—At our Regional Service Center in Mexico City, a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> labor editor assists in the production of publications
                        targeted for the Latin American labor movement.</p>
                    <p>—In Caracas, we produce a bi-monthly labor magazine that has a circulation of
                        30,000 and which President <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Betancourt</persName>
                        praised for its usefulness in presenting democratic viewpoints and for its
                        support of responsible leadership in the Venezuelan labor movement.</p>
                    <p>—We have six Student Affairs Officers attached to our <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> staffs and 25 Student Affairs Grantees
                        in Binational Centers. Their work, which ranges from the all-night bull
                        session to promoting student peace-corps type operations and teaching
                        English in the universities, is bringing the U.S. message to the Latin
                        American students at the individual level.</p>
                    <p>—Our highest priority is given to our program to make important books
                        available in Latin America in Spanish and Portuguese. One year ago, we
                        contracted for 856,000 copies of 92 different books. During the current
                        fiscal year, we have more than doubled our budget and have contracted for
                        1.5 million books. We have asked Congress for a supplemental appropriation
                        that would give us an additional 2 million books; and this year we hope for
                        still additional funds to permit this program to continue to grow.</p>
                    <p>These books, indeed all of our programs, are designed to further the goals of
                        the Alliance for Progress, strengthen the sense of identity of interests and
                        values between the United States and Latin America, and demonstrate that
                        Castro-communism is not the answer to the economic and social problems of
                        the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>Yet, with this look at our efforts, I have still not given you a complete
                        picture of the work of the United States Information Agency, neither in
                        Latin America nor the world. You will begin to see, I think, that we are
                        involved in a serious and imaginative effort to make our <pb n="312"
                            facs="0349" xml:id="pg_312"/>policies intelligible and palatable. It is
                        an effort we would have to undertake, in this complex world, even if we were
                        not confronted with the threat of communism. That communism exists simply
                        makes our work that much more imperative.</p>
                    <p>What does this work cost you?</p>
                    <p>This year, we are working on a budget of approximately $122.6 million and we
                        shall go before Congress asking for a modest increase next year. Perhaps
                        this figure needs some perspective.</p>
                    <p>In 1961, General Motors budgeted $141.5 million for advertising; Proctor and
                        Gamble budgeted $132.7 million, and General Foods budgeted $105 million.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest that the U.S. Information Agency is not working on an
                        inflated budget.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is in a serious business; the business
                        of making our nation respected and understood; of lighting beacons of hope
                        for freedom and progress; of <hi rend="italic">pursuing</hi> freedom and
                        progress for all men everywhere. I believe victory will be ours ultimately;
                        but it will not be ours easily.</p>

                                the cause of freedom and our national interests. There is also much
                                the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cannot do, and it is well
                                for us to understand its limitations as well as its potential if we

                                (Ibid., p. 2)</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> continued by noting:
                                “This is not to say that American policymakers decide what to do or
                                what to say on the basis of which way the winds of thought are
                                blowing; foreign affairs cannot, should not, and are not conducted
                                on the basis of a popularity contest. But it does mean that, in this
                                age of swift communication and swift reaction, our Government tries
                                to present its policies and programs in as understandable and
                                palatable form as possible—understandable and palatable to those
                                millions abroad, friend, foe, and neutral, whose lives and fortunes
                                are affected by what we do.” (Ibid., p. 3)</p></note></p>
                    <p>Mr. Merillat had no prepared statement. His extemporaneous remarks were
                        primarily of a philosophical character pertaining to the role of education
                        in the cold war. In essence, his thesis was that we are basically ignorant
                        of the culture, institutions, mores, and religions <pb n="314" facs="0351"
                            xml:id="pg_314"/>of the rest of the world, and that effectiveness of our
                        communication with other peoples depends upon our understanding them. He
                        stated that the United States has made a start toward the study of various
                        foreign cultures and societies but that much more is needed. He also
                        emphasized the importance of foreign students in the United States in terms
                        of long range benefits.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Merillat engaged in a colloquy with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1"
                            >Fascell</persName> as to whether our efforts are aimed too much at the
                        elite rather than the masses. Mr. Merillat suggested that the only
                        practicable approach was to reach the people through the intellectual elite,
                        while Chairman <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName> suggested the
                        need to get to the people to influence their leaders.</p>
                    <p>The role, if any, of Government in organizing and consolidating our
                        educational exchange efforts was debated with the conclusion that Government
                        can help coordinate but should not direct the educational efforts of our
                        pluralistic society.</p>
                    <p>A final point by Mr. Merillat was that foreign military officers receiving
                        technical training in the United States present an ideological opportunity
                        which is not presently being grasped.<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">An unknown

                                >The Chicago Tribune</hi>, March 31, 1963, p. 14.</note> How about
                        something along these lines:</p>
                    <p>Introduce the entire group of new candidates, and then examine in detail a
                        couple of the newcomers, one of whom would be the Negro candidate.</p>
                    <p>First of all, the film would describe the personal qualities, experience and
                        abilities the successful candidates had to possess in order to win their
                        appointment to the Astronaut program. This would provide the opportunity for
                        a presentation of highlights of the candidates’ family and professional
                        histories.</p>
                    <p>The film would next present highlights of the taxing training program, not
                        only suggesting the exceptional calibre of men chosen for our space program
                        but also forcefully presenting the thoroughness and sophistication of the
                        U.S. program. The two chosen candidates would be shown going through some of
                        this training, ranging from such requirements as the three day hike through
                        a desert without water, to that of mastering the use and control of
                        complicated instruments.</p>
                    <p>This film, tactfully spotlighting the Negro candidate, would have an
                        additional value as a kind of counterpoise to the Russian use of a woman
                        Astronaut, if indeed such a launch occurs and succeeds.</p>

                        is accompanied by a highly retouched photo or drawing of a Vietnamese

                        provided by <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> Wireless File. A major part

                        carried an article on U.S. use of chemicals in South Vietnam. The paper also

                        />they may not in fact be causing death. The newspaper concludes by stating
                        that the Embassy has taken on itself an unworkable and thankless task of
                        attempting to whitewash the actions of the Pentagon’s brass hats in South
                        Vietnam. “But,” the newspaper says, “the executioners will not be saved by
                        American bayonets, nor chemical warfare, nor . . . by American
                        propaganda.”</p>
                    <p>The news release in question was sent to 8,300 addressees. The Embassy and we
                        are pleased at this evidence that at least some of our Embassy press
                        releases are delivered. <hi rend="italic">Komsomolskaya Pravda</hi> in its
                        extremely critical article, incidentally, does not deny the Embassy’s right
                        to engage in this activity.</p>
                    <p>Would this type of information be useful for Congressman <persName

                        <item>Agency’s Lack of “Memory”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>A memorandum listing some of the major problems the Agency faces (as I see
                        them) is en route to you.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Not found and not
                            further identified.</note> Its purpose is to try to establish some order
                        of priority among them, to the end that they may be tackled
                        systematically.</p>
                    <p>However, as I say in that memorandum, there is one problem I consider of such
                        overriding importance that I wish to put it before you separately.</p>
                    <p>This is the fact that the Agency does not sufficiently bring to bear on the
                        problems of the present and future the experience of the past.</p>
                    <p>This is partly—perhaps chiefly—because its “memory” is not good. If we do
                        indeed read the minutes of the last meeting (and not all of us do), we
                        quickly forget them. And when we want to call them back to mind, we have no
                        easy way to do it.</p>
                    <p>The written record is, often, hard to come by. It has not been very well
                        kept, for one thing: not until you directed <persName corresp="#p_SO_1">Oren
                            Stephens</persName> to undertake the job, so far as I know, was there
                        any methodical effort to write the history of the Agency. Such documents as
                        exist are scattered through countless files; and the keepers of those files
                        are usually our lower-grade employees, uninterested in their contents and so
                        unlikely to be able to jog our memory. For this, we are largely dependent on
                        the failing recollections of our oldtimers; and these usually are not at
                        hand at the time we need them.</p>
                    <p>I feel very strongly that we shall not be able to see where we are going, or
                        even where we want to go, unless we see clearly where we have been, and
                        along what roads, and how far, we have come.</p>
                    <p><pb n="319" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_319"/>I know that this problem has been
                        much on your mind: witness your instruction to Oren. I know that Oren
                        himself has done much thinking about it. I know that Bill Grenoble is
                        concerned that training does not take sufficient account of the lessons of
                        the past.<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">An unknown hand, presumably that of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Harris</persName>, underlined the
                            passage: “Bill Grenoble is concerned that training does not take
                            sufficient account of the lessons of the past.”</note> I know that
                            <gloss target="#t_IOA_1">IOA</gloss> has people looking into data
                        retrieval and other uses of the new electronic techniques.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d122fn4">In the right margin next to this paragraph, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR_1">Harris</persName> drew a vertical line and wrote
                            next to it: “<persName corresp="#p_MGA_1">Morgan</persName>, head of

                    <p>Withal, I think the problem of such importance that I suggest it be tackled
                        with all urgency.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation: That <gloss target="#t_IOA_1">IOA</gloss> and/or <gloss
                            target="#t_IRS_1">IRS</gloss> be directed to arrange for a study of the
                        problem, with a view to proposing a solution or solutions. This study might
                        be undertaken by our own people. Or it might be contracted to an outside
                        entity knowledgeable in the field. Or the study group might be a combination
                        of both.</p>
                    <p>I should expect that the group’s recommendations might, int. al., include
                        some or all of the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Consolidation of all files (now scattered through two or three dozen
                        elements of the Agency) in one place, <gloss target="#t_IRS_1">IRS</gloss>
                        or the Secretariat.</p>
                    <p>2. A thorough winnowing of the files to get rid of the chaff (most of it),
                        keep the grain. (Program people would have to supervise this.)</p>
                    <p>3. Extensive indexing and cross-indexing, under the direction of an
                        experienced librarian.</p>
                    <p>4. Foreshortening of the <gloss target="#t_IRS_1">IRS</gloss> timetable for
                        getting into electronic data processing, retrieval, and analysis; and
                        earmarking for this purpose of considerably more than the $50,000 yearly set
                        out in the May, 1962, five-year projection.</p>
                    <p>Solution of this problem will, of course, be vastly facilitated by solution
                        of another you are working on: our sore need for our own building,
                        especially designed to fit our needs, and big enough to house all domestic
                        elements of the Agency.</p>
                    <p>For one thing, that would let <gloss target="#t_IRS_1">IRS</gloss> bring
                        together in one place its library, now scattered among several buildings. If
                        this comes about, I should like to see the library put on the ground floor
                        of the building, and made into a real showplace. In the areas of the
                        Agency’s special interests, the library now constitutes perhaps the best
                        collection of materials in the United States, if not in the world. Properly
                        organized and housed, it could become a Mecca for serious students
                        (especially <pb n="320" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_320"/>for visiting foreign
                        ones) in the field, and so a standing advertisement for the Agency.</p>
                    <p>Solution of the problem is of course not easy.</p>
                    <p>This memorandum was submitted in draft to <persName corresp="#p_SGL_1">Lew
                            Schmidt</persName>. Since I knew that <gloss target="#t_IOA_1"
                            >IOA</gloss> had done some work in the field, I wanted to be sure that
                        he thought the problem one worth putting before you. Agreeing that it was,
                        he had this to say:</p>
                    <p>“I am not convinced that what is being done on the subject of Agency ‘memory’
                        is adequate. As a matter of fact I set up a small task force over a year ago
                        to make a preliminary study as to how <gloss target="#t_ADP_1">ADP</gloss>
                        might be applied to Personnel information. The purpose of this group was to
                        study the possibility of establishing on electronic equipment a ‘memory’ of
                        certain factual material on the collective judgments of Agency officers,
                        particularly those in the Foreign Service.</p>
                    <p>“So far we have not progressed beyond the factual data step. The reasons are
                        three fold: (1) The absence in the Agency now, or in the immediately
                        anticipated future, of the type of equipment necessary; (2) the truly
                        Herculean task of reducing to agreed-upon personnel judgments the material
                        to be placed in our electronic brain; and (3) the cost involved both in
                        money and in personnel in obtaining, utilizing, and developing systems for
                        such equipment.</p>
                    <p>“I have not mentioned another factor, which is the existence of some
                        entrenched opposition to the use of automatic data processing equipment for
                        the storing of such information. The latter can be overcome but impedes the
                        achievement of the various steps in the process.</p>
                    <p>“I am one who believes that within reasonable limits this collective judgment
                        can be brought to bear both in the personnel and the substantive program
                        field sufficiently to record usable material in an electronic memory system.
                        There are many who do not. When you get into this subject, you immediately
                        find that it is not a simple matter of stating historical facts. Even recent
                        history is subject to a tremendous variation of interpretation, depending
                        upon whose memory is being tapped. Collective judgment even on recent
                        ‘historical facts’ sometimes requires extensive argument and compromise.</p>
                    <p>“I believe we should go ahead, but before we do, we must realize that the
                        task will involve months and perhaps a year or two of preparatory work. It
                        should involve the full time of a small staff of the Agency’s best senior
                        officiers. And it should not be undertaken unless we are prepared to undergo
                        the expense either of acquiring the necessary equipment, or of participating
                        in a lease arrangement with some central <pb n="321" facs="0358"
                            xml:id="pg_321"/>servicing organization that makes a business of using
                            <gloss target="#t_ADP_1">ADP</gloss> equipment on behalf of contracting
                        agencies and organizations.<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">“I believe that the
                            actual development of a system for ‘storing’ our material can be done on
                            a contractual basis. The collection, synthesis, and evaluation of the
                            material to go on the machine can be done only by Agency personnel with
                            extensive experience and judgment.” [Footnote is in the
                            original.]</note></p>
                    <p>“Finally, utilization of the system will not be accomplished without
                        additional personnel. The history of the use of these machines has proven
                        that we may “live better organizationally but not that we will live more
                        cheaply.”</p>

                        August and December 1961. It resulted from a number of requests from field

                        squares, fairs, etc., as well as present some more formal performances. The
                        idea originally arose because of the enormous success of the Soviet and
                        Chinese variety shows in the Far East, South Asia and the Middle East. I
                        understand that the proposal was taken up with Ed Sullivan<note n="2"

                    <p>I came in office after the tour was over and believe I can be fairly
                        objective about it. In many respects the tour was a success, but it did <pb
                            n="322" facs="0359" xml:id="pg_322"/>have some very unfortunate aspects.
                        The facts, as I have been able to piece them together, are these: the show
                        was assembled not because someone here thought it would be a wise thing to
                        do, but in response to specific requests from a large number of Far East and
                        Near East posts for an American variety show with a strong appeal for
                        relatively unsophisticated audiences. We asked <gloss target="#t_ANTA_1"
                            >ANTA</gloss> to put together such a group. For advice—a standard
                        procedure—they went to the professional group in that field: the American
                        Guild of Variety Artists (<gloss target="#t_AGVA_1">AGVA</gloss>). President
                        of <gloss target="#t_AGVA_1">AGVA</gloss> was Joey Adams. The show toured 11
                        countries and gave almost 100 performances in 19 cities in the Near and Far
                            East.<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">As part of this tour, <persName

                        counting the groups who saw individual performers who made over 40 visits to
                        hospitals, orphanages and schools during the tour.</p>
                    <p>With very few exceptions our missions in these countries described the
                        success of the show as “outstanding,” “smashing,” or “impressive.” (The
                        exceptions were Hong Kong and Delhi.) I mention these evaluations by our
                        people in the field because they are one aspect of the total reality that
                        was the Joey Adams tour and as such they must certainly be included in an
                        over-all balance sheet.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of that reality is that despite briefings of the <persName

                        the countries they visited, there occurred a series of negative incidents
                        which whitened the hairs and upset the digestions of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers from Tehran to Saigon. In
                        seriousness these ranged from breaches of normal etiquette or local customs
                        by Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AW_1">Adams</persName> to near
                        fist-fights in public between members of the group. Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AW_1">Adams</persName> wrote a syndicated newspaper column
                        during the tour in which she tactlessly criticized living and social
                        conditions in some of the countries visited.<note n="4" xml:id="d123fn4"
                            >Cynthia Adams, a popular columnist, wrote this series of articles,

                        safeguards built into the contract to prevent this sort of thing.) While
                        these incidents were deplorable and caused us and our missions many
                        headaches, it should be pointed out that with few exceptions they had no
                        great impact on the population of the host countries. Most of them occurred
                        behind the scenes, and it was <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and
                        Embassy officers who had to bear the brunt of them. I say this not to excuse
                        them, of course, but to put them in perspective. If one is talking about the
                        impact on the target audiences in the countries visited, I think one would
                        have to say the Joey Adams <pb n="323" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_323"/>show was

                    <p>Because of the publicity given to Cindy’s articles and to our hearings on the

                        relations difficulties in the U.S. for the entire program and has been a
                        major cross to bear as far as our relations to Congressional committees are
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>As you know, soon after I came in office, partly because of this tour, partly
                        because of other various deficiencies I found in the program, I suspended
                        new contracts and called upon the Advisory Commission, headed by <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJW_1">John Gardner</persName>, to study the program and to
                        make new recommendations with respect to selection and administration of the
                            program.<note n="6" xml:id="d123fn6">This report by the U.S. Advisory

                        with the recommendations of the Advisory Commission and I believe it is on a
                        sounder basis now although I am convinced we cannot avoid some trouble with
                        the performing arts under any circumstances.</p>
                    <p>In collaboration with our Advisory Committee on the Arts, (reinstituted as a

                        inconceivable that another tour such as the <persName corresp="#p_AW_1"
                            >Adams</persName> show would be sponsored again. Certainly the contracts
                        are now more explicit about behavior, bills, etc., and one of the major
                        sources of difficulty in the <persName corresp="#p_AW_1">Adams</persName>
                        tour has been corrected through tighter contractual arrangements. We will,
                        of course, continue to send out jazz groups which have been very successful
                        in most areas of the world, but as far as I am concerned, never again a
                        variety show. I doubt that we will want to send another comic of the level
                        of Joey Adams under any circumstances.</p>

                        broadcast Friday, May 10, 1963, MUTUAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>C. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LH_1">Loomis</persName>, do you think the
                        American people ought to hear some of the broadcasts the Voice of America
                        sends abroad?</p>
                    <p>L. Yes, I do. I think the American people are entitled to know what the Voice
                        of America is saying in their name overseas.</p>
                    <p>C. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LH_1">Loomis</persName>, in a recent speech you
                        suggested the domestic use of some broadcasts which are sent out by the
                        Voice of America for worldwide consumption. Wouldn’t that be a radically new
                        departure?</p>
                    <p>L. No, it would not. For several years we have made our material available to
                        domestic stations, primarily educational stations. We made <pb n="325"
                            facs="0362" xml:id="pg_325"/>them available at no cost and at their
                        request. Now, all such programs are attributed to us when they are played by
                        the educational stations domestically. So this is not a departure from at
                        least current practice.</p>
                    <p>C. Well, isn’t there a law forbidding the use of any kind of propaganda
                        broadcasts here in the States?</p>
                    <p>L. There is a—the intent of Congress<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">Reference is
                            to the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948

                            See <ref target="#d1fn2">footnote 2, Document 1</ref>.</note> is clear
                        that we spend our effort broadcasting overseas. On the other hand, the
                        legislation does require us to make available to the press and other
                        responsible U.S. citizens examples of our product, and we view that what we
                        are doing comes under that latter clause. We are making available to
                        domestic stations examples of what we are saying overseas, so that the
                        American people can evaluate themselves on how we are performing.</p>
                    <p>C. What type of program do you make available to this, as you say, primarily
                        the educational broadcasting stations?</p>
                    <p>L. In most cases it is material that is not tied to local, current events
                        because this is all a tape network and it sometimes is many months until it
                        is shown domestically. So this would be material like an educational lecture
                        we did on American Law, or one we may do on farming, or economic system, or
                        something of that nature. We made a series available on our tactics of
                        Communism, which was a series we prepared for exposing Communism to overseas
                        audiences. I would again like to point out that we prepare no program for a
                        domestic audience. Everything that is played domestically was prepared for
                        an overseas audience and is being used as an example domestically.</p>
                    <p>C. In other words, it’s just fair—it’s a rebroadcast here at home. Now I
                        infer from what you say that the type of material which is requested by
                        these local—domestic stations—does not deal with any current, political
                        topics in particular.</p>
                    <p>L. That is true in most cases. There is one exception, which is the
                        educational station in Washington,<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">Presumable
                            reference to either the radio station WAMU, which was established in
                            1951 as a student radio station at American University in Washington, or
                            television station WETA, which first began broadcasting in Washington in
                            1961.</note> because it is physically close to us and it has
                        communications with three other stations, I believe in New York,
                        Philadelphia and Boston, and they take from us normally one or two
                        commentaries a day. Now these are tied to current, political issues. They
                        select the commentaries they wish, and every commentary is labeled “This is
                        what the Voice of America is saying overseas” on the Laotian situation, or
                        whatever it may be . . .</p>
                    <p><pb n="326" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_326"/>C. As I recall it, the intent of
                        Congress when these restrictions were placed on Voice of America, the intent
                        was to prevent the Government from embarking on a program of political
                        propaganda which might affect party relationships at home here. Now I judge
                        from what you say that you don’t even come close to that dangerous
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>L. That is at least our view. Our commentaries are almost entirely dealing
                        with international events. The only domestic events which our commentaries
                        deal with would be major ones, such as race relations. But in at least every
                        case to my knowledge, the ones that have been picked up for domestic use are
                        dealing only with the international problems, such as Laos, Germany, and so
                        forth.</p>
                    <p>C. Suppose the number of requests you receive for this type of program should
                        increase. And, in fact, suppose it should become substantial, do you think
                        Congress would want to review this practice and do you think it would be
                        ready to change its attitude on the . . . and change the legislation?</p>
                    <p>L. Of course, whatever Congress may desire is its prerogative. I think
                        myself, as long as the numbers . . . amount is kept within reason . . . but
                        the thing that is most important, as long as each one is attributed so that
                        there is no question in anyone’s mind what is the source of the information,
                        I think that prevents the Government from doing any propaganda on its own
                        people. If this material was done clandestinely so that it was snuck over on
                        the American people without their knowledge—that in my judgment, is what is
                        dangerous and wrong. But here, where you are saying “This is what your
                        Government is saying to the audience in Asia” . . . I think this is a very
                        proper thing.</p>
                    <p>C. The other day your superior, and the head of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Edward R. Murrow</persName>,
                        complained that he has only about a thousand on the staff of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> compared with 35 thousand missionaries
                        overseas. And he thinks that this is pretty small staff with which to carry
                        on American propaganda. Now, am I right in assuming that the money that is
                        being spent to distribute programs domestically might better be used in
                        overseas broadcasts?</p>
                    <p>L. Well, there is absolutely zero money being spent to distribute this
                        material domestically. We send the tapes to the National Educational
                        Broadcasters. We get back from them much more than we give and the only
                        expense is the mailing of a tape—one tape. Any copies are made at the
                        expense of the station requesting it. So that in this mutual relationship
                        that we have with the educational stations, we get much more than we
                        give.</p>

                        work, are governed by the President’s Statement of Mission to the Director
                        of January 25, 1963.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">See, <ref target="#d109"
                                >Document 109</ref>.</note> The pertinent language is: “The mission
                        of the United States Information Agency is to help achieve United States
                        foreign policy objectives by (a) influencing public attitudes in other
                        nations . . .” This precise statement is one aspect of our continuing
                        efforts to make the information program as directly supporting of and
                        responsive to U.S. foreign policy as is humanly possible.</p>
                    <p>Under recently tightened procedures for preparing country plans, <hi
                            rend="italic">every</hi>
                        <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> activity, including exchanges, must
                        be related to an identified and officially stated U.S. objective in the
                        country involved, and approved by Washington.</p>
                    <p>The most unremitting vigilance is required to keep things going simply from
                        inertia. A media program will tend to continue of its own weight and
                        objectives sandwiched under it unless it is periodically re-examined and
                        justified in terms of objectives. For example, we are now reviewing our
                        support of bi-national centers throughout the world to see specifically if
                        we are getting our money’s worth in progress toward objectives, or just
                        continuing to tread a traditional path.</p>
                    <p>English teaching, exchanges, programs of American studies, school textbooks,
                        and libraries are undoubtedly good in their own right. With our budget, we
                        simply cannot afford to engage in activities because they are “a good thing
                        to do”.</p>
                    <p>Our concept for the use of these tools is, then, the one we apply to all
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> programs. Their use is determined
                        by the answers to the following five questions as they appear in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Country Plan:</p>
                    <p>1. What are the specific objectives of the United States in “X” country, as
                        determined by the Department of State or specified by the U.S.
                        ambassador?</p>
                    <p><pb n="328" facs="0365" xml:id="pg_328"/>2. Which of these objectives can be
                        supported by psychological or informational means?</p>
                    <p>3. What, then, become our psychological objectives in terms of changing
                        attitudes?</p>
                    <p>4. What people, individuals or groups, must we influence to achieve each
                        psychological objective?</p>
                    <p>5. What means—programs, projects, media—can we best use to reach these
                        people?</p>
                    <p>It is in the answer to the fifth question that the role of educational
                        activities is finally and specifically determined.</p>

                    <p>We have become increasingly concerned with the leadership which Indonesia has
                        given Afro-Asian propaganda over the last several months, particularly the
                        poorly camouflaged anti-Western, anti-American denunciations which have
                        characterized Indonesian foreign policy statements since the Brunei
                        rebellion of last December.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">The revolt began in
                            December 1962 by anti-colonialist rebel factions in Brunei opposed to
                            inclusion in the Federation of Malaysia, which would have grouped
                            Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei. Although the
                            rebellion failed, Brunei nevertheless opted out of joining the
                            Federation. (“Revolt in Brunei,” <hi rend="italic">The Washington

                        which Indonesia has taken of Philippine-Malayan differences over Malaysia to
                        drive a wedge between these two pro-Western powers and simultaneously to
                        oblige us to assume a stand in opposition to Philippine aspirations in North
                        Borneo has also complicated our task. A third factor of considerable
                        significance to our program through<pb n="329" facs="0366" xml:id="pg_329"
                        />out the world is the extent of the rapprochement between Indonesia and
                        Communist China, especially as revealed in the proceedings of the Afro-Asian
                        Journalists’ Conference last month in Djakarta.<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3"
                            >The conference took place April 24–May 1. An announcement indicated
                            that conference attendees and organizers resolved “‘to condemn the role
                            played by Israel as agent of world imperialism (and) to condemn the
                            military and nuclear aid given to Israel by the United States.’” The
                            resolution also called for the end of “‘United States imperialist
                            occupation of Formosa.’” (“Jakarta Conference Assails U.S., Israel,” <hi

                    <p>Various factors have made it difficult for the Agency to undertake a
                        concerted effort to counter the undesirable effects stemming from these
                        developments. I believe, however, that the direct attack on the United
                        States contained in the “Djakarta Declaration” of the Journalists’
                        Conference not only offers a good opportunity for but also requires a direct
                        rebuttal. It also seems to me that our Embassy’s note of protest delivered
                        to the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs on May 3<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d126fn4">Not found.</note> at least partially clears the way for
                        such action.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the note was written in the Embassy ten days ago<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d126fn5">May 7.</note> to meet an immediate need makes it
                        unsuitable as a peg for any of our proposed output. However, I wonder if the
                        four additional Conference resolution published after the delivery of the
                        note and accusing the United States of imperialist intervention in Cuba,
                        Laos, Korea and South Viet-Nam may not offer an excuse for drafting another
                        protest intended for public release. Such a note could serve as the opening
                        gun in a campaign to set the record straight on “imperialism” and
                        “neo-colonialism”, two terms which have been overworked in Indonesia
                        recently. We would plan not only to exploit the protest in our press and
                        radio output, but would follow up with additional materials refuting the
                        specific charges levied against the U.S. and its allies and exposing Chinese
                        communist tactics in their attempts to capture the Afro-Asian movement.
                        These materials could take the form of a series of radio and press
                        commentaries and analyses of “imperialism” and “neo-colonialism” as well as
                        pamphlets on such subjects as the Afro-Asian Journalists’ Conference
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>Another useful action I think we might take would be to offer the Malayan
                        government modest assistance in its proposed Asian Journalists’ Conference,
                        scheduled for June of this year. For example, if our Embassy in Kuala Lumpur
                        believed it desirable, we could quietly circularize the posts in the area
                        for suggestions as to reliable and objective journalists who might be
                        invited by the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> to attend the
                        conference. We would also plan extensive coverage of the event by all Agency
                        media.</p>
                    <p><pb n="330" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_330"/>Should it appear not desirable to
                        send another note to the Government of Indonesia, we would still plan—with
                        the Department’s concurrence—to undertake a campaign, as outlined above, to
                        set the record straight. I believe, however, that such a campaign would not
                        be as effective, since much of our audience would tend to regard it as mere
                        words without deeds.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Roger:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Your suggestion that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> undertake certain
                        propaganda activities indicating that Communist North Viet-Nam is falling
                        increasingly under Communist Chinese influence is and has been under serious
                        consideration for some time. As you know, my people have been talking with
                        representatives of the Working Group/Viet-Nam about this project for several
                        months. In January there was an exchange of memoranda between Bill <persName
                            corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AB_1"
                            >Burnett Anderson</persName>, our Deputy Assistant Director (Policy and
                        Plans) on this subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">Not found.</note></p>
                    <p>I agree that the best way to handle this would be “by highlighting every
                        visit or program between North Viet-Nam and Communist China and by
                        frequently citing the innumerable instances in Vietnamese history when the
                        Chinese have sought to or have actually gained control of Viet-Nam.” We
                        believe, however, that this will be a difficult thing to handle and should,
                        if attempted, remain under constant and careful review. It should be done
                        principally through editorial selection and emphasis in news output. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_AB_1">Burnett Anderson</persName> stated in his
                        memo to Bill <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> of January 25,
                        the best way for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to plug this line
                        aside from appropriate handling of spot news would be to prepare and place
                        in some South Vietnamese publication an article or series of articles on the
                        background of Sino-Vietnamese relations—articles which could be picked up
                        and replayed by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> with proper attribution
                        to Vietnamese sources. It must be recognized that the only way <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can reach audiences in North Viet-Nam is
                        by radio, and we must constantly <pb n="333" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_333"
                        />keep in mind that anything which <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        broadcasts in the Vietnamese language can be heard by listeners in both
                        North and South Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>Our <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Vietnamese specialists have pointed
                        out that there are possible pitfalls in such an operation. In emphasizing
                        that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Vietnamese broadcasts are heard in
                        both North and South, they point out that emphasis on <gloss

                        increase the dimensions of the threat that looms from the North. Since one
                        of our propaganda objectives in South Viet-Nam has been to dispel the
                        illusion that the Viet Cong are “ten feet tall,” unless very carefully
                        handled the addition of the Chinese factor into the equation in propaganda
                        output might prove counter-productive. Even the traditional ethnic enmity
                        between the two races and the Vietnamese fear of the Chinese may be
                        overshadowed by the elements of sheer power and geographic propinquity
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>It should perhaps be further pointed out that with over one million Chinese
                        residents in South Viet-Nam who will also hear these broadcasts, we must
                        exercise caution in emphasizing any traditional enmity between the two races

                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> also raises the question: Even if we

                        the Chicoms while they still have a chance? After all, they say, Communist
                        China is doing pretty well in its contest with the Soviets, and its victory

                        Tuesday address, reached a peak of invective Thursday characteristic of the
                        Stalin era.</p>
                    <p><pb n="337" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_337"/>“Bands of racists are intensifying
                        armed terror,” Moscow Radio said in an English language broadcast yesterday.
                        “They are killing Negro leaders and marching stormtroop detachments through
                        the streets.</p>
                    <p>“Many of the methods used by U.S. Fascists and racists resemble those of
                        Hitler’s time. The use of dogs against people was borrowed from Nazi
                        concentration camp practice . . . Furthermore, what are basically
                        concentration camps of the Buchenwald and Auschwitz pattern have been set up
                        with barbed wire cordons, starvation rations, and brutal beatings to drive
                        the inmates to suicide. The fascist swastika can be seen more and more
                        clearly against the background of the burning crosses of racism.</p>
                    <p>“Events in the United States are a serious accusation against the much
                        advertised American way of life, the so-called Free World, and the entire
                        system of capitalism. This system engenders war and slavery, oppression and
                        deception, and baseness and murder. Such a system has no future.”</p>
                    <p>The Peking press has carried those portions of the speech which support its
                        allegations of “ . . . rabid persecution of the Negroes by the racists and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s admission of the
                        surging discontent of the American Negro people.”</p>
                    <p>Radio Havana reported the speech without comment, stressing the passages
                        having to do with discontent, frustration, and discord.</p>
                    <p>Available reaction from other areas:</p>

                    <p>Prominent coverage is reported from six countries—Algeria, Ghana, Morocco,

                        down in history as one of the greatest champions of the rights of man that
                        ever lived.” <hi rend="italic">La Republique</hi> of Oran said your position
                        is categoric and courageous and “it is certain that segregation will be
                        vanquished finally.” The Minister of Commerce in Mali telephoned Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWJ_1">Handley</persName> to say that the speech
                        had “touched the heart of all Africans” and to express his support for what

                    <p>Many editorials viewed the situation as grave. Copenhagen’s <hi rend="italic"

                        by some papers that the speech may have served to head off the rise of
                        extremism among both Negroes and whites. Generally, editorialists felt the
                        speech was both courageous and a persuasive appeal to the consciences of the
                        American people.</p>

                        appeared in Brazil, Mexico and Chile. Papers in Rio de Janeiro of all

                    <p>2177. For Ambassador and Principal Officer. Government is deeply involved
                        both with immediate problems arising from incidence of racial tension and
                        with long-term issue of civil rights which lies at center of country’s
                        existence as a democratic state. Administration is keenly aware of impact of
                        domestic racial problem on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> image overseas
                        and on achievement <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign policy
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>There should be no illusions as to seriousness this situation. As far as
                        American domestic developments concerned policies of this Administration
                        have been sound and its actions consistent. On one hand, Federal Government
                        power and prestige are committed to full equality, a commitment fortified by
                        even larger elements of our society. On the other hand, there still exists
                        articulate and determined opposition. We must assume therefore that racial
                        incidents will continue and their geographic location will spread. Problem
                        is national rather than exclusively southern dilemma.</p>
                    <p>Foreign reaction is source great concern. Evidence from all parts of world
                        indicates that racial incidents have produced extremely negative reactions.
                        Characteristic is recommendation in May of assembled foreign ministers at
                        Addis Ababa conference of African Chiefs of State. They recommended Chiefs
                        of State pass strongly worded resolution on discrimination in <gloss

                        appropriate opportunities to emphasize at all levels the gains which have
                        been made and steps Federal Government and private agencies are taking.</p>
                    <p>(c) Suggest post review its governmental and public relations programs on
                        civil rights and adapt to new situation.</p>
                    <p>Finally, request you report concisely on reactions local groups, particularly

                        respect to diplomatic or other actions United States might take.</p>

                        in these communications, it occurs to me that you will wish a special
                        comment on the position here. I sense, also, that it is needed.</p>
                    <p>Were it necessary as the Department suggests to move on the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> and the various channels of public opinion
                        at this time in order to seek understanding of the race problem in the U.S.,
                        we would be in a bad way. And such crash effort would be wholly devoid of
                        conviction. There is at least a chance that it would arouse the suspicion
                        that we were leading from a bad conscience and with some desire to conceal
                            <pb n="342" facs="0379" xml:id="pg_342"/>unpleasant truth. At most we
                        would succeed in persuading a few captive journalists and foreign office
                        functionaries whose influence in any case is inconsequential.</p>
                    <p>In fact the problem of race relations in the U.S. has been a continuing theme
                        of the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and the Embassy for the last
                        two years. We have consistently emphasized: (A) that the situation is
                        imperfect; (B) that the administration and the courts are moving as rapidly
                        as our institutions and their built-in rigidities on human attitudes allow;
                        (C) that we are doing so partly out of idealism but partly because the
                        administration presently in power in the U.S. owes both its present position
                        and its hope for re-election to its Negro supporters. I might also add, not
                        without some passing pleasure, that I have attributed our position on
                        colonialism to the same hard political circumstances. Support of white
                        colonialism in Africa would be quite inconsistent with the reliance on the
                        support of ex-colonial people in the U.S. (I might further note with all
                        tact that this line of argument brought a sharp rebuke from the Portuguese
                        Government and a request from Washington that it not be again employed).</p>
                    <p>Against the foregoing background and with the help of the rather more
                        important fact that the fundamental sincerity of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> administration is not questioned,
                        our position in India is excellent on the subject of race relations. Not
                        even Blitz, Link or Communist New Age<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">These are
                            three leftist Indian newspapers.</note> seriously flog us for the
                        mistreatment of the Negroes. In the last twelve months, although I am not
                        conscious of having avoided personal public exposure, I have not once been
                        taken to task in any press conference, student audience or other forum with
                        our shortcomings on this issue. In the last few months there have been
                        occasional editorials suggesting that the administration is not pressing
                        rapidly enough on civil rights legislation. But these have been well
                        reasoned and at this particular juncture the administration might itself
                        concede the justice of the argument.</p>
                    <p>Our comparatively good position here has another cause. South and central
                        Africa where there are large numbers of Indians in subordinate positions,
                        together with Angola and Mozambique which are much closer, all act as
                        lightning rods. Racially aroused editors, writers and other public opinion
                        leaders are impelled to attack these countries first. This is why much more
                        than parenthetically it is important for us to be completely clear in our
                        record on Portuguese colonialism and on South African and Rhodesian white
                        supremacy in Africa. Ambiguity here would have made us seriously suspect.
                        However because of my courtly good manners I do not press this lesson.</p>
                    <p><pb n="343" facs="0380" xml:id="pg_343"/>As long as it is genuinely evident
                        that the administration is doing its best we need not worry about our public
                        posture on this problem at least in India. I have repeatedly pointed out
                        that were nothing happening in the U.S.—were there complete tranquility on
                        the racial front—it would mean that the Negroes were accepting a subordinate
                        place and the white supremacy was secure. That would be the worst situation.
                        The price of progress is a measure of civil disturbance. In a once
                        caste-ridden country such as India this can be understood.</p>
                    <p>I note that further guidance on this subject will be forthcoming. It is
                        unnecessary.</p>

                        sure you are aware that our Embassy in Djakarta sent an excellent follow-up
                        to its original protest to the Indonesian Government about the Afro-Asian
                        Journalists’ Conference (Djakarta’s Telegram 1885, May 24, 1963 and

                    <p>We agree with your suggestion considering the Asian Journalists’ Conference
                        proposed by the Malayan Government, and shall cable our Embassy in Kuala
                        Lumpur for its reactions to your idea that the posts in the area might be
                        quietly circularized for suggestions as to reliable and objective
                        journalists who might be invited by the Malayan Government to the
                        conference. Our last information (dating from late March) indicates that
                        this conference is aimed by the Malayan Government at setting public opinion
                        straight with respect to Malaysia, and that the conference is scheduled
                        rather vaguely for some time this summer rather than specifically June as
                        earlier reports stated. Our staffs can keep in touch with each other
                        regarding further developments about this conference.</p>

                            xml:id="d134fn2"><persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> visited
                            Europe between June 22 and July 2. He first traveled to Germany,
                            arriving on June 22 and departing for Ireland on June 26. From Ireland,
                            he traveled to the United Kingdom on June 29, where he spent one day
                            before flying on to Italy the following day. He concluded the trip in
                            Italy.</note></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Western Europe:</p>
                    <p>Western European media were almost unanimous that the visit was an
                        overwhelming personal and psychological success but a limited political
                        success.</p>
                    <p>You were widely viewed as projecting the image of a spirited and determined
                        leader whose personal warmth and dynamism had previously been
                        underestimated. The themes developed in your speeches most widely acclaimed
                        were: western unity, your categorical pledges to stand by our European
                        allies, the promotion of peace, and your efforts to find better relations
                        with the East. Comments on counter-acting Gaullist policies and the quest
                        for a multilateral nuclear force were divided and more critical. In only a
                        few instances did commentators judge the trip an unqualified success.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Visit to Germany:</p>
                    <p>Following the official welcome at Wahn Airport, the crescendo of popular and
                        press acclaim rose rapidly. Even strongly Gaullist papers conceded that your
                        reception by the Germans surpassed that of de Gaulle.</p>
                    <p>Prior to your visit, <hi rend="italic">Die Welt</hi> of Hamburg had pictured
                        you as “a political manager without passion, an engineer or a manufacturer
                        of power.” Subsequent to the Berlin visit, it wrote: “This was a <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>
                        <pb n="346" facs="0383" xml:id="pg_346"/>we had not seen before. His former
                        coolness gave way to passion and to an unconditional personal commitment for
                        this city.”</p>
                    <p>A number of papers credited the visit with changing your views on Germany.
                        The independent <hi rend="italic">Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger</hi> said “if
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> ever had reservations
                        vis-à-vis the Germans—and there are indications that this was the case—his
                        Berlin visit has certainly lessened them.”</p>
                    <p>Your statements on European unity<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3"><persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> spoke about European unity
                            throughout his trip. On his arrival in Germany at the Bonn-Cologne
                            airport at 9:50 a.m. on June 23, he said: “Our strategy was born in a
                            divided Europe, but it must look to the goal of European unity and an
                            end to the divisions of people and countries.” (<hi rend="italic">Public
                                Papers: Kennedy, 1963</hi>, p. 497) He most notably stressed this
                            theme in two addresses. He delivered the first on June 25 at 4:30 p.m.
                            at the Paulskirche in Frankfurt; he declared: “The future of the West
                            lies in Atlantic partnership—a system of cooperation, interdependence,
                            and harmony whose peoples can jointly meet their burdens and
                            opportunities throughout the world,” and “[i]t is only a fully cohesive
                            Europe that can protect us all against the fragmentation of our
                            alliance.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Kennedy, 1963</hi>, pp. 517
                            and 520) He delivered the second address on July 2, the final day of his
                            trip, in Naples at <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Headquarters,
                            in which he declared: “The age of interdependence is here. The cause of
                            Western European unity is based on logic and common sense. It is based
                            on moral and political truths.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:
                                Kennedy, 1963</hi>, p. 552)</note> drew support from Scandinavia to
                        Italy, but were also widely interpreted as directed in part against de
                        Gaulle. Many papers found a positive aspect in this approach, crediting you
                        with “opening the way (to European integration) which de Gaulle has barred,
                        (something) which no European politician has been able to do since the break
                        in Brussels” (<hi rend="italic">Berlinske Tidende</hi>, conservative,
                        Copenhagen).</p>
                    <p>Several German papers appeared uneasy at the prospect of an ultimate choice
                        between the U.S. and France, and tried to ride the fence. The
                        Social-Democratic <hi rend="italic">Neue Rhein Zeitung</hi> of Cologne
                        wrote: “<persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> will not hesitate to
                        make political capital out of his new friendship with the Germans, but he
                        also will not overtax this friendship to the disadvantage of our solidarity
                        with France.”</p>
                    <p>French papers were less outspoken on this issue. <hi rend="italic">Le
                            Figaro</hi>’s comment that West Germany needed both American and French
                        friendship and “could not choose between the two” was representative.</p>
                    <p>The Western European press was at one in praise of your renewed pledges to
                        defend our allies, including some French papers. The anti-Gaullist <hi
                            rend="italic">Depeche du Midi</hi> of Toulouse, one of the most
                        influential provincial papers, spoke of the “categoric manner” in which the
                        U.S. assured the security of Europe and that its contribution was both
                        “necessary and sufficient.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin</p>
                    <p>The Social-Democratic <hi rend="italic">Neue Rhein Ruhr Zeitung</hi> of Essen
                        summed up the views of many papers when it wrote “nobody in the White <pb

                        expected the President to identify himself so unreservedly and so
                        courageously with the cause of Berlin and with the German cause as he did in
                        his address at the Schöneberg city hall.<note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4"
                                ><persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s address in
                            Berlin, which he delivered at 12:50 p.m. on June 26 on the steps of the
                            Schöneberger Rathaus, included his famous statement: “All free men,
                            wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a
                            free man, I take pride in the words ‘<hi rend="italic">Ich bin ein
                                Berliner</hi>.’” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Kennedy,
                                1963</hi>, p. 525)</note> Never before has a foreign statesman
                        identified himself with the German cause in this form, on such a stage and
                        so convincingly.”</p>
                    <p>A sour note was sounded by the hyper-Gaullist <hi rend="italic">Paris
                            Presse</hi> which complained that your pronouncements in Berlin might
                        have gone beyond assuring Europeans of U.S. determination to stand by its
                        pledges and that “the U.S. President is now accountable for the enthusiasm
                        he aroused.”</p>
                    <p>Your statements on relations with the Iron Curtain countries were generally
                        supported. The left-center <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter Rundschau</hi>
                        said, for example, “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s
                        great peace offensive nourishes our hopes for a rapprochement with the young
                        progressive forces in the East.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ireland</p>
                    <p>In Europe generally, your visit to Ireland was seen as a “sentimental
                        journey” and a “homecoming” without political implications. Within Ireland,
                        no event in modern times has received such detailed press, photographic, and
                            <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> coverage. There is still no consensus
                        about the political significance of the visit, but there has been
                        speculation about Ireland’s role in world events and relationships with

                            Africa and which may some day be in Europe, and I regard it as a very

                    <p>News coverage was moderate. Japanese commentators were inclined to agree that
                        you had allayed German fears over West Berlin, and also interpreted the

                        called for a greater U.S. effort in Asia with the comment that “the root of

                        visit provided for “revanchist” leaders to fan “the slanderous campaign
                        against East Germany.” Moscow concluded that you were “evaded” in Italy,
                        “approved only in principle” in Britain, and “warmly received” by the
                        revanchists in Bonn.</p>
                    <p>Peking was harshly critical, picturing the tour as a “cunning diplomatic move
                        with evil designs.” A New China News Agency report of June 27 said you had
                        made “five provocative and aggressive speeches . . . unscrupulously
                        slandering the socialist system and expressing U.S. determination to . . .
                        subvert the German Democratic Republic and other East European socialist
                        countries.” A Red Chinese labor official asked: “How can this satan
                        incarnate be viewed as an envoy of the people?”</p>
                    <p>Cuban media interpreted the trip as an effort to gain approval for U.S.
                        “aggressive policies” and adjudged it a complete failure.</p>

                        program is detailed below.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SITUATION</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communists could set off an atomic test explosion any time in the
                        next few years. They will undoubtedly attempt to use every available means
                        to extend their influence by enhancing Red China’s strength image.</p>
                    <p>We want to blunt the expected Chinese Communist efforts in advance by
                        promoting understanding of:</p>
                    <p>(1) The “nuclear facts of life” which (a) make the United States the world’s
                        strongest nuclear power, and (b) separate major from minor nuclear
                        powers;</p>
                    <p>(2) The fact that a crude “show” atomic explosion would not give Communist
                        China even a minor nuclear-military capability, which takes years to
                        develop.</p>
                    <p>You should begin a program for this purpose, drawing on the treatment points
                        below and the guidelines in the referenced State-Defense-<gloss

                            >USIA</gloss>’s main role in the interagency program will be to develop
                        the positive aspect—U.S.-Free World strength, avoiding a preoccupation with
                        the negative side—Chinese weakness. A spellout of suggested methods appears

                        POINTS</p>
                    <p>These are the main points you should make:</p>
                    <p>(1) The United States is so strong that it can withstand an attacker’s first
                        strike and still strike back with overpowering force. Having pledged never
                        to be the attacker, the U.S. maintains defensive strength second to none in
                        order to deter any first strike. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> said in his June 10, 1963 “peace” speech: “The
                        United States, as the world knows, will never start a war.”<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d135fn3">See <ref target="#d129fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                129</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>(2) The President on June 10 thus defined the peaceable use of United States
                        strength: “America’s weapons are non-provocative, carefully controlled,
                        designed to deter and capable of selective use. Our military forces are
                        committed to peace and disciplined in self-restraint.”</p>
                    <p>(3) The United States works actively for safeguarded international
                        disarmament. Until this goal is reached it must exert its strength to deter
                        aggression. U.S. deterrence is long range, effected by the ability to
                        deliver nuclear warheads with intercontinental missiles, aircraft or
                        submarines.</p>
                    <p>(4) The United States can and will fulfill its commitments to defend the free
                        peoples of Asia against threats to their independence or integrity, and will
                        not hesitate to do so at any time regardless of any degree of Chinese
                        Communist nuclear capability, in claim or in fact.</p>
                    <p>(5) All three major nuclear powers—the U.S., <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, and U.K.—view with concern the possible spread of nuclear
                        weapons to an increasing number of countries, because this could lead to
                        local conflicts which could escalate into world war. All three, therefore,
                        would regard any such developments, especially a threat to use a nuclear
                        weapon, as a very serious matter.</p>
                    <p>(6) The major nuclear powers—the U.S., U.K., and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>—each have superiority over all other nations in large and
                        varied nuclear stockpiles and in means of delivery. Both are very costly and
                        take years to develop. Over a dozen nations could develop into secondary
                        nuclear powers after years of effort, but they could not hope to become
                        major nuclear powers in the foreseeable future. Among potential secondary
                        nuclear powers are: Belgium, Canada, Communist China, Czechoslovakia,
                        France, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and
                        Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>(7) Any of these powers could achieve a “token” nuclear capability with one
                        or a few “show” nuclear test explosions within a very short period. The
                        atomic bomb is no secret any more: the techniques of <pb n="353" facs="0390"
                            xml:id="pg_353"/>putting one together have long been publicly known. But
                        this would be years from even a secondary nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>(8) Within Asia, both India and Japan possess atomic scientific know-how
                        comparable to Communist China’s. Atomic science can be turned toward peace
                        or war. India and Japan are devoting their atomic programs to peaceful
                        purposes, whereas Communist China is using hers for weapons.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">APPROACH</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(1) Interagency program:</p>
                    <p>Bear in mind that the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> program is one
                        part of a coordinated interagency approach which has both positive and
                        negative sides. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will deal mainly with
                        the positive aspect: the meaning of U.S. nuclear strength and its relation
                        to potential secondary nuclear powers, including Communist China. There is
                        also, of course, a negative side: Communist China’s technical and economic
                        weakness and her prestige-oriented struggle to produce a “show” atomic
                        device. This negative approach we shall leave largely to others; as an overt
                        U.S. agency, our credibility on this negative aspect is relatively low
                        because (a) the U.S. has no official contacts with Communist China, hence no
                        acknowledged sources of information; and (b) the U.S. has an obvious axe to
                        grind. This does not mean, of course, that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> should ignore the negative side completely; rather,
                        insofar as possible, use attributed materials from third country or other
                        sources likely to have credible authority concerning conditions inside
                        Communist China. Chief <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> emphasis
                        should go to the positive side, which is basic because it offers a calm,
                        confident context of understanding without which the negative part would
                        fail.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(2) Pace:</p>
                    <p>Your program should include regular but not too frequent approaches, and
                        should proceed in a quiet, relaxed manner, avoiding sudden spurts of
                        activity. This is because (a) we do not wish to convey an impression of
                        nervous preoccupation with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom_1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        nuclear problem, and (b) your materials will necessarily deal with U.S.
                        military strength, and we want to avoid an appearance of saber-rattling.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(3) Target audiences:</p>
                    <p>Primarily Asian countries, with particular emphasis on those nearest
                        Communist China; but you should set a program in motion wherever a <gloss
                            target="#t_ChiCom_1">ChiCom</gloss> nuclear explosion is likely to make
                        an impact. Within each country, plan a phased presentation, starting with
                        approaches to government officials and other influential groups and later
                        extending the effort to include mass media if feasible and effective.</p>

                        Operating methods:</p>
                    <p>Approaches are likely to vary considerably from one country to another; you
                        may decide that personal contacts and placement of selected printed
                        materials will be the most effective approaches initially, and perhaps
                        throughout, your program. You should maintain close cooperation with
                        parallel activities of the Country Team, such as the briefings at Far
                        Eastern posts using Defense Department materials, an activity outlined in
                        the referenced circular.</p>

                        statements making negative points on Chinese Communist weakness.</p>

                    <p>The twin issue of civil rights and race relations is a major detraction to
                        U.S. policy objectives in many countries.</p>
                    <p>Our difficulty is heightened by (1) genuine misunderstanding abroad of an
                        extremely complex domestic problem, rooted in U.S. history and current U.S.
                        economic, social and political realities, (2) <pb n="355" facs="0392"
                            xml:id="pg_355"/>commercial media coverage which misrepresents the
                        situation by emphasizing sensational developments, on the principle that
                        violence makes headlines while nonviolence makes dull reading, and (3)
                        deliberate distortion by our enemies who are fostering and exploiting an
                        impression of pervasive injustice and intolerance in the United States, a
                        nation which claims to champion equality and equal opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Our essentially corrective task is to do everything possible to offset the
                        effect of distortions and misrepresentations, dispel misunderstandings born
                        of ignorance, incomplete information and oversimplification, and thus, where
                        possible, obtain sympathetic understanding and support of interested nations
                        for the national government’s civil rights efforts.</p>
                    <p>The issue, and the problems it creates at home and abroad, will be with us

                        of the United States as those features will inevitably generate; so our
                        secondary corrective task is to show that controversy and disorder are
                        inevitable by-products of the national drive to realize the ideals of equal

                            >Kennedy</persName> set the tone for output and established the
                        direction to follow: (1) Candor in recognizing the dimensions and complexity
                        of the problem, (2) full and active Administration support of all measures
                        required to solve the problem.</p>
                    <p>The President said: “The very struggles which are now calling worldwide
                        attention to the problems are themselves signs of progress and the results
                        of these struggles will be increasingly visible.”</p>
                    <p>Commercial media assure overseas awareness of the “struggles” and the
                        “problems.” It is up to us to redress the balance by seeking to assure that
                        the “progress” and the “results” are indeed increasingly visible.</p>
                    <p>Without sacrifice of candor in reporting major news, we must round out the
                        picture by emphasizing all available evidence that the nation is moving to
                        complete the task of providing equal rights and opportunities for all its
                        citizens. This means:</p>
                    <p>(1) Giving priority to developments which show constructive movement toward
                        solution of the problem at whatever level—national, regional, state, local.
                        Bear in mind that—nationwide—more schools, <pb n="356" facs="0393"

                        developments are integrated than are not; every new instance of integration
                        adds to an already favorable balance. Graphic material on other subjects
                        should show the high degree of integration which exists in many aspects of
                        American life.</p>
                    <p>(2) Looking for and using sources which will give us a continuing flow of
                        news about significant constructive developments, however unspectacular.</p>
                    <p>(3) Making a deliberate effort to background each positive item or positive
                        sequence of items with materials to show that such developments are not
                        unique but part of a mounting trend.</p>
                    <p>(4) Providing frequent, regularly scheduled recapitulations of positive
                        developments to show consistent progress. When appropriate, in these
                        recapitulations and in the course of regular reporting, we should recall
                        official recognition of the enormity of the problem, as stated by the

                        civil rights campaigns, and (c) the positive response of major elements of

                        photos, films, television and exhibits. Volume of output to a given country
                        should be commensurate with the need for corrective materials in that
                        country. The media should consult with Area Policy Officers in determining

                        POINTS:</p>
                    <p>(1) By Executive Order alone, the President can set reforms in motion.
                        Federal and State legislatures can do so through legislation. The courts,
                        both Federal and State, can do so through their rulings.</p>
                    <p>Look for and give prominence to such moves. But do not suggest that
                        legislation, executive orders or court rulings—alone or in combination—can
                        solve complex human relations problems wholly or finally. Solution will also
                        require a wide range of voluntary, cooperative and continuing initiatives on
                        the part of communities, professional, business, labor and other groups, and
                        individuals.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for this—stemming from the nature of the U.S. political, social
                        and economic structure—require explanation in commentary and other output.
                        The Administration is actively encouraging voluntary, cooperative
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p>(2) No single day of Congressional hearings will fairly or accurately
                        represent the course and prospects of the President’s proposals for civil
                        rights legislation. Beyond the requirements of credibility, the fast media
                        are not obliged to provide detailed, day-by-day accounts of civil rights
                        proceedings in the Congress. Periodic situation reports, which permit fuller
                        explanation of the legislative process and its intricacies, are
                        preferable.</p>
                    <p>The testimony of witnesses who favor the President’s program often presents
                        examples of progress, e.g., the successful application of existing
                        antidiscrimination measures. We should watch for such items and include them
                        in our periodic roundups.</p>
                    <p>We should avoid speculation about the outcome of Congressional action on
                        specific features of the President’s legislative proposals, and relate
                        passage of economic and social legislation—e.g., Federal support of job
                        training—to the enhancement of equal opportunities for which the President’s
                        total civil rights program calls.</p>
                    <p>(3) In explaining the nature of the U.S. federal system, we should make it
                        clear that local police and law-enforcement officials are locally appointed
                        and directed. Unlike the system in most countries, local police are not, in
                        this country, under the control of the national government.</p>
                    <p>(4) We should bear in mind that, particularly in Africa, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> is a positive symbol of current
                        U.S. efforts toward progress in civil rights.</p>
                    <p>The positive emphases which this guidance advocates are not intended to gloss
                        over negative developments. It is a key feature of our open form of society
                        that we disclose both rough and smooth sides of the way we work toward
                        national ideals.</p>
                    <p>Therefore this guidance should not be interpreted as an injunction against
                        reporting, in perspective, newsworthy unfavorable or contro<pb n="358"
                            facs="0395" xml:id="pg_358"/>versial developments or resistance to the
                        Administration’s programs. However, local disturbances which are not likely
                        to be exploited abroad should not be reported. Our positive emphases are
                        intended to keep the national goal in sight—even when other sources of
                        information, however motivated in their reporting of developments, tend to
                        obscure that goal.</p>

                            xml:id="d137fn3">This 1963 film about a mass escape of U.S. and British
                            prisoners from a German prison camp during World War II, featured a
                            large cast of well-known actors, including Steve McQueen, Richard
                            Attenborough, and James Garner. The film was based on the 1950
                            non-fiction book of the same name written by Paul Brickhill. McQueen won
                            the Film Festivals award for best actor for his performance in the film.

                    <p>“The Great Escape” was selected by the Hollywood Guilds Festival Committee,
                        which is comprised of members appointed by the presidents of the Directors
                        Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Screen Producers Guild and
                        the Writers Guild of America. The need to increase and augment the prestige
                        of the United States and of the American film art at international motion
                        picture events was immediately apparent when I took over as Director of this
                        Agency. It seemed obvious that a qualified body of experts of the motion
                        picture industry itself, in cooperation with the government, was required to
                        meet this objective effectively. Thus, this Festival Committee was formed at

                        and has made the selection of the official American film entries to all
                        major festivals since the spring of 1962. Where political <pb n="359"

                        the Moscow Film Festival, the Committee consults with the government on the
                        appropriateness of any motion picture as an official entry. Present members
                        of the Committee are: Willis Goldbeck, Gene Kelly, Richard Widmark, John

                    <p>The Committee considered a number of motion pictures in the process of
                        selecting the official United States entry in the Moscow Film Festival,
                        including the film “How the West Was Won.”<note n="5" xml:id="d137fn5">This
                            1963 Academy Award-nominated film was directed, in part, by the famous
                            film director John Ford and starred a large cast of famous actors,
                            including James Stewart, John Wayne, and Debbie Reynolds.</note> Almost
                        up to the time of the Festival entry deadline, the Committee did not feel
                        that it had found just the right film for this event. When “The Great
                        Escape” was offered for consideration, however, Committee members were
                        unanimous in selecting it as the official Festival entry.</p>
                    <p>Upon receipt of the Committee’s nomination, the Agency made arrangements for
                        review of the film by government officers in the Department of State and
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Those who saw the film felt that
                        in addition to its technical and cinematographic excellence, it dramatically
                        illustrated the precept that whatever the conditions, the human spirit will
                        strive to remain free. They also noted, as did the Russians, that it gave
                        counterpoint to the image of Nazi Germany military leadership set forth in
                        present Communist propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Officials of the Soviet Embassy also saw the film. They thought the treatment
                        given the Nazi prisoner of war camp and Nazi military leadership not
                        understandable within Russian experience with the Nazis, but interposed no
                        objection to the film’s entry in the Moscow Festival.</p>
                    <p>The American Embassy at Moscow has since reported that the Soviet
                        publications <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi>
                        and <hi rend="italic">Trud</hi> praised “The Great Escape” for the
                        performance of its cast (Steve McQueen received the award for best actor),
                        and have otherwise acclaimed the excellence of the picture. They have been
                        caused, however, to rise in the defense of their own anti-German

                    <p>Many thousands of Americans will march in Washington August 28 to call on the
                        U.S. Congress for a redress of grievances.<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">The
                            March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom took place on August 28 and was
                            led by the Reverend <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">Martin Luther King,

                        long-standing national ideal of equal rights and opportunities for all
                        citizens, regardless of race.</p>
                    <p>The march will support legislation to protect and strengthen equal rights and
                        opportunities in a variety of fields where, despite much progress, racial
                        discrimination still exists. In its proposed “Civil Rights Act of

                        Congressional leaders of both major political parties will receive the
                        leaders of the march.</p>
                    <p>The demonstration will assemble citizens of all races and from many states,
                        both North and South. Among them will be representatives of organizations
                        heading the drive for equal rights, of the major religious faiths, of the
                        trade union movement, and of many socially conscious interracial groups.
                        Members of the Administration, of Congress, of state and municipal
                        governments will take part.</p>
                    <p>Representing a broad cross-section of national sentiment, the marchers will
                        exercise the right of peaceful assembly and of petition to promote the cause
                        of other civil rights. The march will demonstrate the confidence of citizens
                        both Negro and white that the objectives of equal rights and opportunities
                        can be realized through the democratic process. It will also illustrate the
                        determination of many Americans, white and Negro, to complete the task of
                        realizing a basic U.S. principle—that all men are created equal, and that
                        the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one are
                        threatened.</p>
                    <p>Realistically, most Americans understand that neither Presidential orders,
                        nor Federal or state legislation, nor court rulings—nor any combination of
                        those three forms of action—can eliminate entirely all <pb n="362"

                        America becomes, in fact, the egalitarian country of its creed. But in
                        historical perspective the rapidity of progress is astonishing.”<note n="5"

                        throughout Asia and other underdeveloped areas. It would also be a

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">6.</hi> The U.S. must accept the
                        risks of covertly organizing a coup if necessary.</p>
                    <p>The available evidence indicates that there is a deep reluctance in the
                        Vietnamese officer corps to accept the hazards of promoting a coup d’état.
                        It is therefore possible that action to topple the Ngo Dinh regime would not
                        automatically follow even the most severe U.S. measures, e.g. suspension of
                        aid, with resulting near chaos. It is also essential that the eventual
                        successor regime be willing to cooperate with the U.S., including commitment
                        of U.S. combat forces if the war can be won no other way.</p>
                    <p>In the writer’s judgment, conditions in Viet-Nam have deteriorated so badly
                        that the U.S. would be drawing to a three-card straight to gamble its
                        interest there on anything short of an ultimate willingness to use combat
                        troops. Even if all-out pressures succeeded in unseating the Ngo Dinhs,
                        which is not an automatic certainty, at least not immediately, there is real
                        danger that the successor regime would be equally or even more ineffective
                        against the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>. There is also the danger
                        that the Vietnamese military forces would fragment, dividing the country
                        into rival camps, with disastrous consequences.</p>
                    <p>If we are not willing to resort to U.S. forces, it is wholly possible that
                        efforts to unseat the Ngo Dinhs would produce results that would be worse,
                        from the U.S. viewpoint, than a negotiated “neutral” settlement. It is also
                        possible that a prolonged deadlock would stimulate an irresistible shift in
                        international and American public opinion in favor of such a settlement.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, a decision now to use U.S. forces if necessary would give
                        the whole U.S. effort psychological lift, producing confidence that we need
                        not be frustrated indefinitely, giving us a sure <pb n="365" facs="0402"
                            xml:id="pg_365"/>hand that has been lacking in the past. When and if it
                        became desirable to make this intention public, we would have a lever of
                        immense value vis-à-vis the Vietnamese. Such a new sureness in our actions,
                        with the clear implication that the U.S. “means business,” would quickly get
                        through to the Vietnamese and to third countries and thus conceivably itself
                        remove the need to resort to force.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it should also be noted that the present situation in Viet-Nam is
                        confronting the U.S. with what was certainly an inevitable showdown on the
                        thesis that Western industrial power somehow must always be frustrated by
                        Communist guerrilla tactics applied against a weak, underdeveloped
                        government that refused foreign advice and reforms of the very ills that the
                        Communists live on. There are incipient insurrections of this sort all over
                        the underdeveloped world and the outcome in Viet-Nam will have critical
                        bearing on U.S. capability to prevent and/or suppress them.</p>
                    <p>In the writer’s opinion, furthermore, there is a very real possibility that
                        if and as Viet-Nam is conclusively being lost to the Communists, the U.S.
                        will be forced to use force in any case as a last resort . . . just as we
                        did so unexpectedly in Korea. It would be vastly wiser—and more effective—to
                        make this unpalatable decision now.</p>
                    <p>From this basis of strength, U.S. policy should seek establishment of a new
                        government that would be as strong as possible but in any case would accept
                        introduction of U.S. forces if necessary to defeat the <gloss
                            target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>. Ideally the whole Ngo Dinh family should be
                        removed, but the U.S. would accept retention of Diem in a figurehead role.
                        It is essential that the <persName corresp="#p_N_1">Nhus</persName> leave
                        the country permanently. (A specific time period, say six months, would not
                        be sufficient since their influence and political apparatus would
                        survive.)</p>
                    <p>Application of this policy should be on a step-by-step basis, thus hopefully
                        achieving U.S. ends with minimum damage to the war effort against the <gloss

                    <p>1. For the short term, continuation of the present heavy diplomatic pressure
                        on the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>. This would be designed to
                        combine with outside events—congressional threats to cut aid, increased

                        censure, and perhaps even a world-wide trend toward consideration of
                        DeGaulle’s proposals<note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">On August 29, President de
                            Gaulle, at a meeting of the French Council of Ministers, made a
                            statement on France’s interest in assisting Vietnam. The French Minister
                            of Information later read the statement to reporters. It reads in part:
                            “Every national effort that might be undertaken in Vietnam toward
                            [unification and independence] would find France ready, to the extent of
                            her own possibilities, to set up a cordial cooperation with this
                            country.” (Peter Grose, “De Gaulle Offers to Help Vietnam End Foreign

                        force Diem and <pb n="366" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_366"/>the <persName
                            corresp="#p_N_1">Nhus</persName> to capitulate voluntarily and/or
                        precipitate a spontaneous military coup.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that such pressure be developed with an eye to giving Diem
                        some kind of face-saving escape. Perhaps, for example, the U.S. should begin
                        talking publicly about ousting the whole family, so that it eventually could
                        compromise on departure of only the <persName corresp="#p_N_1"
                            >Nhus</persName> with the explanation that Diem had been “misled” or
                        some such. With Orientals in general and notably with the Ngo Dinhs,
                        capitulation is virtually impossible if they are painted into a corner.</p>
                    <p>2. When this fails, as is probable, application of selected cuts in U.S.
                        assistance, preferably through imposition of conditions on its use rather
                        than outright surgery . . . which would have the same effect. The cuts
                        should be applied to items of minimum importance to the war effort against
                        the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> and maximum importance to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_N_1">Nhus</persName>’ political maneuvering, e.g.
                        the Special Forces. The cuts should be widely publicized and in fact be
                        chosen more for their psychological impact than expectation of serious
                        damage to <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> operations.</p>
                    <p>If this did not quickly produce a spontaneous coup, the U.S. should begin
                        covertly planning one. At this point dramatic deterioration of U.S.-<gloss
                            target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> relations must be expected, with distinct
                        physical danger to U.S. nationals and a virtual standstill in the advisory
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>3. Suspension of all aid to the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> and if
                        this also failed to unseat the regime, implementation as quickly as possible
                        of the planned coup. If this also failed, or only partly succeeded, there
                        should be plentiful excuses to bring in U.S. forces, e.g. to restore order,
                        protect American citizens, etc. Such forces should be prepared for attack by
                        loyal <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> troops, but it is more likely
                        that they would simply act as power in being, making it possible now for the
                        U.S. to have its way by simply presenting the Ngo Dinhs with an ultimatum.
                        Something similar to this happened when U.S. forces were introduced into
                        Lebanon in 1958—with notably little resulting damage to the U.S. political
                        position in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that third country hostility toward the Ngo Dinhs is already
                        so considerable that this kind of reluctant, gradual but persistently
                        determined application of U.S. power would similarly be accepted in Asia.
                        And once U.S. forces had been introduced into Viet-Nam, it would be
                        relatively simple—on the invitation of the new <pb n="367" facs="0404"

                            is that the U.S. should do something. The military effort will drop off
                            in the future as officers become disaffected as a result of Diem’s
                            oppression of the people. He said that the program proposed by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJB_1">Phillips</persName> was inadequate and
                            that the suspension of aid was not enough. He urged that we go whole hog
                            and be prepared to use U.S. combat forces if necessary to remove the
                            entire government of Diem and <persName corresp="#p_N_1">Nhu</persName>.
                            Withholding U.S. aid would create chaos in Vietnam for months. There is
                            a chance that everything we try will fail and we would be obliged to use
                            U.S. forces in the last resort to protect U.S. lives. The Diem
                            government will not surrender short of the immediate presence of U.S.
                            forces. We might have to use U.S. forces to support the war effort in

                        policies. There is virtually no sympathy for the Diem regime, except in
                        South Korea and the Philippines where officials see Diem as the only
                        available anti-communist bulwark. This applies to some extent to Thailand as

                    <p>The situation in Viet-Nam continues to receive major news play but editorial
                        comment has slackened during past week. Available comment, both media and
                        official, has tended to focus on the question of continued U.S. support for
                        the Diem regime. Reference to the possibility of a neutralized Viet-Nam, as
                        implied by De Gaulle, has been limited. Buddhist groups in Thailand, Burma
                        and Cambodia continue to agitate against <gloss target="#t_GVN_1"
                            >GVN</gloss> treatment of Buddhists. Peking and Hanoi reports now
                        reflect belief that U.S. may eventually replace Diem but that this will not
                        affect the war.</p>

                    <p>Viet-Nam crisis remains the subject of continuing and extensive news coverage
                        and considerable editorial comment in the West European press. Comment has
                        been almost totally critical of the Diem family regime. Though not
                        uncritical of some American moves, the majority of non-communist papers
                        display considerable sympathy for the U.S. dilemma, and have offered few
                        concrete suggestions for remedies. Recent news coverage has played up U.S.
                        alleged participation in anti-Diem moves but editorial comment on this
                        subject is not yet available.</p>

                        viewing U.S. as faced with necessity of dealing with “difficult and corrupt”

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSION</p>
                    <p>Virtually no sympathy or support for Diem regime except as noted above. Some
                        sympathy for U.S. dilemma in Viet-Nam. I would expect this note of sympathy

                            >USIS</gloss>-produced personal publicity for Diem began to decrease
                        after the first two years. Since that time, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> has resisted Vietnamese efforts to promote the “cult of
                        the personality,” but of course we have been unable to prevent the
                        Vietnamese from doing so on their own.</p>
                    <p>The only major <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> activity of the past
                        year which might be regarded as supporting Diem rather than the war effort
                        as such was the printing and distribution nationwide of two million posters
                        with Diem’s surrender appeal, carrying his picture. It was considered
                        necessary at the time to use his authority to make the appeal effective.</p>
                    <p>During the past several years U.S. economic assistance has provided for the
                        Vietnamese a large supply of equipment for the printing of magazines,
                        newspapers, posters and leaflets, for the production, distribution and
                        showing of motion pictures, and for radio broadcasting. Many Vietnamese have
                        developed skills in the information field. <hi rend="italic">In short, the
                            Vietnamese can now conduct rather extensive (though probably not
                            successful) information programs without outside assistance</hi>. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> has continued a deep involvement in
                        Vietnamese information operations for two reasons: 1) to maintain higher
                        standards of quality than the Vietnamese could do alone, and 2) to retain a
                        measure of <hi rend="italic">control over the content of the
                        propaganda</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The all-important control over content has often gone to us by default. Many
                        information projects which the Vietnamese might have undertaken either alone
                        or with American technical assistance have not been <hi rend="italic"
                            >initiated by the Vietnamese</hi> because of timidity, bureaucratic
                        inefficiency or indolence—it was easier to let the Americans carry the ball.
                        Thus, films, publications, radio programs and other information output were
                        prepared by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>, reflecting the positive
                        U.S. approach, and submitted to the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> for
                        approval. They were more often than not approved without modification.</p>
                    <p>Propaganda efforts conducted by the Vietnamese alone have, to a large extent,
                        consisted of personal aggrandizement of Diem and the Ngo family, and inept
                        and heavy-handed anti-communist propaganda. Much of it was
                        counter-productive in terms of gaining popular support for government
                        programs. But, even propaganda activities in which the <gloss
                            target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has played the leading role were often
                        carried out in concert with Americans, either military or civilian. And, for
                        example, when the Vietnamese would prepare a leaflet and ask <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> to print it, we could suggest changes,
                        or, in extreme cases, simply find reasons why we could not print it.</p>
                    <p>With the advent of martial law and the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s
                        repressive moves against opposition elements came a profound change in

                            problem [the need for government policy on international expositions and
                            world fairs being organized In the United States], with special emphasis

                            <p>“That the larger purpose would be to develop an exposition policy to

                        basic difference of opinion that has existed between the Department of
                        Commerce and the U.S. Information Agency virtually since the inception of
                        the Government’s exhibit program over nine years ago.</p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that from the beginning, the wording of both enabling and
                        appropriation legislation, legislative history, and expressions of
                        Presidential intent have clearly defined the purpose of the international
                        exhibit program as psychological, Commerce sought to make of the operation a
                        trade promotional venture. The Agency has consistently held that in
                        consonance with the clear legislative and executive intent, it should be
                        primarily psychological. Since the inauguration of the present
                        Administration the officials of Commerce responsible for the operational
                        aspects of the program have been in more substantial agreement with <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. There are several reasons for the
                        Agency position.</p>
                    <p>First, by its very nature, the large exhibition is a propaganda spectacular.
                        Its psychological impact is implicit in its existence. When the exhibit is
                        American, the host populace expects the unusual. Properly handled, the show
                        becomes a propaganda instrument of superb visual <pb n="375" facs="0412"
                            xml:id="pg_375"/>force. Assembled haphazardly and without planned
                        message content, it can be a source of disappointment, even ridicule.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets recognized the propaganda impact of the exhibition substantially
                        before the U.S. Government officially took notice. The late 1940’s and early
                        50’s saw a crescendo of Soviet participation at international trade fairs,
                        unopposed by any official U.S. effort. Even Red China got into the business
                        ahead of the first American endeavor. Our absence was noted. In fact it was
                        the rapid psychological success of the Bloc’s exhibitions effort that
                        prompted U.S. Government entrance into the field. Several Congressional
                        representatives, having observed abroad the results of Soviet efforts, urged
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> to propose
                        legislation and fiscal support that would enable this country to compete.
                        Congress responded and the program was born in the late summer of 1954.</p>
                    <p>Since then, we have frankly competed on the international trade fair and
                        exhibit stage with the Communists, and whether we state so publicly or not,
                        the sphere of competition has generally been propagandistic rather than
                        commercial.</p>
                    <p>A second reason is closely akin to the first. The Communist nations are still
                        intent on proving to the world’s developing nations that their system is
                        best designed to make an industrial giant of a once backward country. Thus,
                        the average Soviet (or Bloc nation) exhibit is characterized by massive
                        arrays evidencing industrial might. Industrial display is for the Communist
                        nations synonomous with their propaganda message. But America’s reputation
                        as an industrial power is already made and little doubted abroad.
                        Conglomerate arrays of our productive capacity achieve little propaganda
                        impact that we have not already won many times over. Instead, we find
                        ourselves in need of proving such theses as: (1) the aspirations we enjoy in
                        common with peoples of the country hosting the fair at which we exhibit, and
                        the concerted friendly manner in which America strives to promote our common
                        goals; (2) the cultural accomplishments of American society; (3) the
                        humanity, social concern for, and contribution of our economic system to our
                        people; (4) the vitality, variety, and pre-eminence of our scientific
                        achievements. A strictly commercial fair competes unnecessarily with the
                        Bloc on ground we have already mastered, while losing by default areas of
                        ideological competition we should seek to win. Only by conscious planning of
                        the exhibit for propaganda impact do we reach these goals.</p>
                    <p>But there is still a third reason for the Agency position, grounded in
                        legislative-executive intent and history. I have already alluded to the fact
                        that Congress created the program as a weapon of ideological competition
                        with the Communist world. Throughout the remainder of the preceding

                        Congress has for nine years appropriated funds for this program with the
                        express understanding that the money was being used for the attainment of
                        propaganda objectives abroad. Its consistent use for other purposes would be
                        a technical illegality, and most certainly would cause Congress to reassess
                        the validity of making any further appropriation under this legislation.
                        Congressional reaction to such misuse has now been made doubly certain by
                        the fact that Commerce has sought and obtained, under a different authority
                        and separate appropriation, funds for trade fairs of a strictly trade
                        promotional character.</p>

                        ballet fiasco. She had therefore picked up the story between Wednesday
                        morning <pb n="379" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_379"/>and Friday evening. I am
                        certain that neither of the State Department people with whom I took up the
                            matter—<persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Luke Battle</persName> and Frank
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFG_1">Siscoe</persName>—would have mentioned it
                        to anyone; nor did Pam, nor did Nancy, nor did I.</p>
                    <p>I note that “The Palace Music Hall”<note n="9" xml:id="d144fn9">According to
                                <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>’s Jean Battey, “‘The

                            warmed-over musical comedy dancing. . . . ‘The Palace’ could be a
                            pleasant change of pace on a full evening’s program but it is really not

                        publicity, it might have been worthwhile to get them to substitute another
                        number. In view of the publicity, dropping “The Palace Music Hall” would
                        probably cause new problems.</p>

                        <p>The Robert Joffrey Ballet was formed in 1955 and has subsequently made
                            annual tours in the United States. The ballet toured several countries
                            of the Near East from December 1, 1962 to March 7, 1963 under the
                            auspices of the Cultural Presentations Program of the Department of
                            State and the Rebekah Harkness Foundation, a private nonprofit
                            organization which has given financial support to individuals and
                            organizations in the fields of music, ballet, and medical research.
                            Among those dance groups previously assisted by the Foundation was
                            Jerome Robbins’ “Ballet <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>”. Newspaper
                            reports and those from the several Embassies indicated that the group
                            was well received in the Near East. (See attached press excerpts.)<note

                        <p>The U.S.–U.S.S.R. exchanges program provides for reciprocal tours of
                            major performing arts groups, and the Joffrey Ballet was considered by
                            the Department of State as a possible attraction to be proposed to
                            Goskontsert, the Soviet State Concert Agency, in exchange for the
                            “Bolshoi Stars”. This group is only a portion of the Bolshoi company
                            which last toured the United States in 1961,<note n="15"

                            Mr. Sol Hurok<note n="16" xml:id="d144fn16">Hurok organized and financed
                                concerts and tours.</note> of New York. Since the Soviet Union has a
                            long tradition in ballet, and in view of the successful tours of other
                            American ballet companies (American Ballet Theatre in 1960 and the New
                            York City Ballet in 1962), which introduced more recent forms of ballet
                            to Soviet audiences, the Advisory Committee on the Arts of the State
                            Department recommended that another ballet group be sent to the Soviet
                            Union in return for the “Bolshoi Stars”.</p>
                        <p>The panel of dance experts responsible to the Advisory Committee on the
                            Arts recommended the nomination of the Robert Joffrey Ballet for a
                            Soviet tour. This panel was composed of: Mr. William Bales, Chairman,
                            Dance Department, Bennington College; Miss Ann Barzell, Dance Critic,
                            Chicago American; Dr. George Beiswanger, Georgia State <pb n="381"

                            Miss Martha Hill, Chairman, Dance Department, Juilliard School of Music;
                            Miss Lillian Moore, Dance Instructor and Dance Critic; Mr. John
                            Rosenfield, Dance Critic, Dallas Morning News, and Mr. Walter Perry,
                            Dance Critic, New York Herald Tribune.</p>
                        <p>Mr. S.V. Shaskin, Artistic Director of Goskontsert, visited New York City
                            in early September to attend rehearsals of the group and to assist in
                            the selection of programs for the Soviet tour. The tour consists of
                            eight weeks and 54 performances, opens in Leningrad on October 15, and
                            continues to Kharkov, Odessa, Donetsk, Kiev and Moscow. The financial
                            arrangements were concluded between the American Embassy in Moscow and
                            Goskontsert and provide for a weekly fee of $7,000 plus room, board, and
                            other internal expenses and a portion of the international
                            transportation costs. Mr. Hurok is also contributing to the
                            international transportation costs. The remaining expenses of the ballet
                            are being borne by the Foundation. It is contemplated that the net cost
                            to the Cultural Presentations Program of the Department of State will be
                            less than twenty percent of the total cost of $96,500 to send the
                            Joffrey Ballet to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Ballet plans to present three programs during the Soviet tour as

                        any of the agencies for this statement.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce position</hi>—The Secretary’s views reflect a
                        belief that the balance of payments situation should increase the importance
                        attached to the promotion of American exports in the selection of sites for
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> “trade fair” exhibits abroad. The
                        exhibits should be mounted in countries where there is a significant
                        potential for sales of American products.</p>
                    <p>This “trade fair” program, which originally was a special program of the
                        President, has always included an important element of trade promotion.
                        Participation of American businessmen in the display, and more lately the
                        sale, of their products has been sought and obtained from the beginning.
                        Special missions of American businessmen often were and are sent to many of
                        the exhibits to promote American products. The U.S. Government and American
                        businessmen should not invest the considerable amounts of money and effort
                        required in countries where few sales can be expected, such as
                        Czechoslovakia, Indonesia, Guatemala, etc.</p>

                        position</hi>—National exhibits, usually shown at bona fide trade fairs, but
                        also shown “solo” in major foreign cities, have become a significant
                        propaganda tool in the Cold War. Our propaganda purpose is often well-served
                        if the economic attainments of this country are <pb n="383" facs="0420"
                            xml:id="pg_383"/>shown and explained through industrial or trade
                        promotion exhibits. Or this propaganda purpose may be best served by using
                        an industrial or trade exhibit largely as a cover for more subtle
                        explanations of this country and its point of view. The major purpose being
                        propaganda, the site, theme and content of these exhibits must be determined
                        by propaganda needs, not trade promotion needs. To the extent possible,
                        however, without subverting the major propaganda purpose, promotion of U.S.
                        exports should also be an element in the exhibit.</p>

                        has supported <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> views on site and theme

                    <p>3. Since 1962 appropriations for the program have been sought and obtained as
                        part of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> budget not as part of
                        “Funds appropriated to the President.”</p>
                    <p>4. In 1962, the President delegated his authority for exhibits abroad under
                        the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName

                            >USIA</gloss> alone.</p>
                    <p>5. Beginning in 1960 the need for outright trade promotion exhibits abroad
                        became more evident. This administration recognized this need by seeking and
                        obtaining a specific Commerce appropriation for a trade promotion exhibit
                        program entirely under the control of Commerce.</p>
                    <p>6. Early this year State, Commerce and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        jointly instructed all <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> posts

                        “trade fair” program had a primarily informational objective and that trade
                        promotion should be included “insofar as this can be done within the

                        that Acting Director <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> and
                        Assistant Secretary of Commerce Behrman have agreed on sites to be proposed,
                        largely to the satisfaction of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.
                        Whether or not Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">Hodges</persName> will

                        be reaffirmed.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> “trade fair” program is primarily
                        informational in objective. Trade promotion should be included insofar as it
                        can be done within psychological objectives. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> principally makes that judgment. Thus, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should determine the site, theme and
                        content of its exhibits after receiving the advice of Commerce and
                        State.</p>
                    <p>The Commerce trade fair program is primarily to promote American exports.
                        Psychological objectives are secondary but should be included upon the

                        the trade promotion objectives. (On August 11, 1961, the President requested
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> “to assure the maximum
                        psychological effectiveness of [all] United States exhibit efforts

                            >USIA</gloss> chooses to make.</p>
                    <p>Because of the informal nature of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1"

                        on this matter perhaps should in the first instance be verbally transmitted
                        to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">Hodges</persName> and Acting
                        Director <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName>. If the President

                        the President or you indicating the President’s decision so that officials
                        and staffs of both agencies clearly understand the President’s views. Staff
                        of the Budget Bureau are, of course, available for whatever drafting

                        <salute>Dear John:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I hope I am being overly pessimistic but the days immediately ahead look
                        rather dark for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>. Your memo to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC_1">Lodge</persName><note n="2"
                            xml:id="d146fn2">Not found.</note> pertaining to the possible closing
                        down of our field support posts is disquieting. So is the fact that the
                        attacks on <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> not only continue in the
                            <hi rend="italic">Times of Viet-Nam</hi> but are now being extended to
                        vernacular newspapers.</p>
                    <p>I have one thought on the situation which perhaps may be gratuitous, but I
                        would not feel right if I did not pass it on to you. Since the pressure on
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> may well include increased
                        personal pressure on you of the type you have already experienced, you must
                        be extremely careful in the weeks ahead to be cleaner than a hound’s tooth.
                        It seems to me that you may have to be unusually circumspect in your
                        relations with the Vietnamese and the U.S. correspondents in order not to
                        allow the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> the possibility of laying a
                        real glove on you.</p>
                    <p>I am sure you have thought of this already. I suppose, also, that if the
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> decides to cut <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> down and cut you down too, what you do
                        will make little difference. But in case they’re undecided and wavering, it
                        surely is important that we don’t give them any unnecessary excuses for
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Ed is really doing very well in light of the magnitude of his operation. I
                        went out to see him several days ago and we had a good talk. His spirit and
                        his guts are pure <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>. We
                        discussed Viet-Nam and he asked me to send you his warmest regards.</p>

                        MESSAGE</p>
                    <p>It is essential that a special effort be made to persuade identifiable
                        potential leaders to turn to the West rather than the East if they intend to
                        seek education or training abroad.</p>
                    <p>The Interagency Youth Committee has noted that U.S. Government scholarship
                        programs generally do not make provision for training potential young
                        leaders from the less-developed and uncommitted countries if they have
                        neither the background nor the apparent capacity for formal education.
                        Persons of this kind are, however, accepted for training and indoctrination
                        in the Communist Bloc. To illustrate the kinds of young people we mean, your
                        attention is called to A–286 from Cotonou, and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> field message #11 from LaPaz, portions of which are
                        attached.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this message is to urge posts to evaluate these types of young
                        leaders and potential leaders for USG attention <hi rend="italic"
                            >before</hi> they accept Bloc training offers.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        are considering means of offering pre-university, technical, vocational and
                        leadership training to such young leaders; the private sector is also being
                        approached.</p>
                    <p>We know that the problem of identifying such leaders is difficult, that the
                        Communists, with their local cadres, may have a tactical advantage when
                        democratic groups are less organized, and that the <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> technical and
                        academic training programs already require considerable identification and
                        selection of potential leaders. Yet the <pb n="387" facs="0424"
                            xml:id="pg_387"/>kinds of young leaders we mean are often missed because
                        of the lack of programs to accommodate them; and with the stakes as high as
                        they are, a priority effort must be made.</p>
                    <p>Information requested: If such training were made available in the West or in
                        the home country, would it be possible to persuade the kinds of potential
                        young leaders who now go to the Bloc to accept Western assistance instead?

                        <p>This paper suggests that our efforts to identify and to cultivate West
                            Africa’s second generation political leaders may be considerably more
                            complex than we presently imagine. We should never assume, for example,
                            that such leadership will necessarily emerge from a highly-educated
                            elite corps. On the contrary, several signs point toward the development
                            of grass roots demagoguery as the best means of obtaining political
                            power.</p>
                        <p>With rare exceptions, today’s leaders in former French West Africa are
                            relatively well-educated. Nonetheless, nearly all enjoy a base of
                            national or regional support that makes them forces to be reckoned <pb
                                n="388" facs="0425" xml:id="pg_388"/>with in their own countries. It
                            is precisely this grass roots political pull that the young
                            intellectuals lack and presently show few signs of acquiring. Several
                            years study in Paris or Dakar seems to leave them with little
                            inclination to get their feet in the soil. Anyone who has seen American
                            students from Operations Crossroads<note n="6" xml:id="d147fn6"
                                >Operation Crossroads Africa was a private, non-profit entity that
                                initiated self-sufficiency programs in Africa through the work of

                            glory of manual labor will understand this all too clearly.</p>
                        <p>With the popular field thus largely abandoned by the university graduates
                            and with the passing of the older generation, the keys to political
                            power thus may well fall into the hands of demagogues who have remained
                            close to the soil and close to the people who live on it, or who can
                            pretend to have done so. Traditional tribal and regional political
                            institutions, blended with increasing awareness of the power of the
                            ballot box, will also favor bush politicians. Finally, the almost
                            certain failure of the educated elite to provide easy solutions for
                            Africa’s pressing economic and social problems will give the demagogues
                            a ready target to fire at.</p>
                        <p>No suggestion is made that we stop or even reduce our present efforts to
                            reach Africa’s young intellectuals; they will occupy second echelon and
                            technical positions of importance in any case. We should anticipate,
                            nonetheless, a sizeable number of Huey Longs<note n="7" xml:id="d147fn7"
                                >Huey Long served as the Governor of Louisiana and as a Senator

                            future ministers and presidents. Identifying them in time and persuading

                            Russians should have at least as much difficulty as we in this

                        <p>“(Daniel) Guerra comes from a lower middle class family. His father, a
                            man dedicated to leftist ideals, was a writer and translator for PRENSA
                            LIBRE until his death some six months ago. The boy is intelligent and
                            affable and one can see that he has a direct pipeline to his people and
                            their problems . . .</p>
                        <p>We are, in this geographical area at least, missing the boat tremendously
                            in our student exchange program. It appears that we are choosing young
                            people from social levels that will not combat the prevailing leftist
                            influences. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that students must meet
                            the requirements of private U.S. universities. But whatever the reason
                            may be, I feel that we should somehow simplify arrangements so that
                            students from this <hi rend="italic">campesino</hi> level may be sent to
                            the United States for education and training. English is a requirement
                            in the majority of our scholarship cases. At the University of Patrice
                                Lumumba,<note n="10" xml:id="d147fn10">This university in Moscow,
                                established by the Soviet Government for foreign students, was named
                                after the Prime Minister of Congo who was killed in January
                                1961.</note> however, the student is enrolled without having to meet
                            any language requirement and during a two-year period is gradually and
                            effectively brought into classes taught in Russian. These young people,
                            furthermore, do not have to worry about breaking up their university
                            careers with a one-year tour abroad. They are given full scholarships to
                            complete a full curriculum and come back to their country with a degree
                            and ready to go to work.</p>
                        <p>Much has been said—pro and con—about our meeting Iron Curtain scholarship
                            programs both by increasing the number of students sent and by lowering
                            the academic standards for them. I am not in a position to comment on
                            that. I do know, however, that the students who go from Cochabamba to
                            the United States are not usually chosen from a level of militant youth
                            who will return to Bolivia and actively participate in promoting the
                            democratic systems under which they have lived in the States. I doubt
                            that we have any Daniel Guerras in the States. It seems to me that we
                            should overhaul our local standards of selection on the one hand and on
                            the other make some provision there to handle students who come from
                            such rarefied cultural backgrounds as those from Bolivia.”</p>

                        following statement:</p>
                    <p>“In the Soviet Union, it was found necessary to draw attention to the
                        activities of such subversive radio stations as “Freedom,” “For the
                        Liberation of Great Russia,” “N.T.S.,” “Free Russia” which continue their
                        broadcasts to the Soviet Union in Russian and the languages of other
                        nationalities of our country. It is no secret, that these radio stations,
                        speaking on behalf of various organizations hostile to the Soviet Union, are
                        financed and controlled by American organizations and groups. The contents
                        of their broadcasts are of a dirty, slanderous character and cannot but
                        cause indignation of the Soviet public with regard to those who direct and
                        lead the work of the said radio stations.</p>
                    <p>“The activities of such radio stations are in a manifest contradiction with
                        the task of the normalization and development of relations between the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA_1"
                            >USA</gloss> and it is time to put an end to such activities.</p>
                    <p>“It should also be noted, that, in violation of international agreements,
                        these radio broadcasts are conducted on the radio waves which belong to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and a number of other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>“As is known to the American side, the Soviet organizations, having expressed
                        their good will, stopped jamming radio broadcasts of “The Voice of America”
                        to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“We should like to hope that the American side will take this into
                        consideration, that it will approach our appeal with understanding and will
                        take measures within its responsibility to put an end to the above-mentioned
                        anti-Soviet radio broadcasts.</p>
                    <p><pb n="391" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_391"/>“This would respond to the purposes
                        of improving Soviet-American relations.”</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador explained that this was not a formal statement but that he had
                        simply been instructed to speak to me personally along these lines. As lunch
                        was announced at this point, I had no opportunity to reply.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">COMMENT</p>
                    <p>The Soviets may be seeking an excuse to resume jamming, although I would
                        doubt this from the care with which <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> emphasized that this was not a formal statement.
                        Nevertheless, I suggest that careful consideration should be given to what
                        reply, if any, should be made.</p>

                        the activities of some of our unofficial radio broadcasts and although he

                    <p>I have suggested a few minor changes but there is not much that can be done
                        to mitigate the effect. However, in view of their own attitude on
                        ideological matters, I do not think the effect of the speech will be too
                        serious. My main concern is that they might resume jamming. One suggestion
                        might be to insert after the first paragraph a few sentences in
                        justification of these activities along the following lines:</p>

                            to information and to Western thought and receives a one-sided view not

                    </list>
                    <p>Since the appointment of <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Edward R.
                            Murrow</persName> as Director, in March, 1961, a number of far-reaching
                        changes have been effected in the policies, operations, procedures and
                        output of the U.S. Information Agency. Inventoried below are some of the
                        more significant of these changes. This listing is for the information of
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employees who, engrossed in their
                        own segment of the Agency operation, may like to know of changes and
                        developments in other areas.</p>
                    <p><pb n="393" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_393"/>The role of the Director and his
                        senior officers in the formulation of foreign policy has been greatly
                        strengthened. No longer is <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> handed a
                        policy and told to make the best of it. The Agency’s counsel is now sought
                        whenever national policies with foreign implications are being formulated.
                        The Director participates actively in all meetings of the National Security
                        Council and its executive committee. His key officers consult daily with
                        their counterparts in the White House, the Department of State and other
                        federal departments and agencies. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                            >Kennedy</persName>’s January 25, 1963 statement of mission for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> charged the Agency with the
                        responsibility for “advising the President, his representatives abroad, and
                        the various departments and agencies on the implications of foreign opinion
                        for present and contemplated United States policies, programs and official
                            statements.”<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">See <ref target="#d109"
                                >Document 109</ref>.</note> That statement is very much an
                        operational fact.</p>
                    <p>A revamping of functions has taken place in the Agency’s Office of Policy to
                        meet the problems and opportunities of the changing times. The country
                        planning mechanism was overhauled to streamline and sharpen the functioning
                        of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> as an integral component of the
                        overseas country teams. A media coordinator has been assigned to ensure that
                        the many instruments of communication used by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> are synchronized both in content and in timing. A long
                        range planning officer has also been assigned to provide guidelines for
                        other than immediate policy and media objectives to be reached in five to 10
                        years. A youth and student affairs officer plans and promotes activities and
                        output directed to these critically important audiences. Another officer has
                        been assigned to ensure the inclusion of overseas research findings in the
                        Agency’s policies and programming.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">FIELD POSTS</p>
                    <p>At overseas posts paper work has been subordinated to leg work. The volume of
                        reporting from the field to headquarters has been reduced by about 20% to
                        permit a corresponding increase of field officers’ time in furthering
                        programs and policies. Remaining reporting procedures have been simplified
                        and streamlined.</p>
                    <p>Length of overseas tours, except in critical hardship posts, has been
                        extended 50% from two to three years and a policy is followed whereby key
                        officers often return to the same post for a second tour. This permits
                        better use of officers who thus have greater time to develop contacts and
                        know the problems.</p>
                    <p>Regional specialization for foreign service officers has been made the rule.
                        No longer are officers assigned from one area to another <pb n="394"
                            facs="0431" xml:id="pg_394"/>throughout their careers, thus acquiring a
                        smattering of expertise in one area only to be assigned away from it for the
                        next tour. To the extent possible, they now spend the bulk of their overseas
                        careers in a single cultural or ethnic region.</p>
                    <p>The diffusion of effort and output that characterized <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> during the first years of its existence
                        is ended. No longer is the Agency’s mission “to tell America’s story
                        abroad”; no longer does <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> scatter its
                        fire indiscriminately to all segments of all populations. “Targetting”,
                        always an ideal, is now a reality. Audiences are carefully selected—together
                        with the techniques of reaching them and the contents of the message—to
                        achieve maximum influence leading to political action. All <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media function in synchronization: if
                        the theme is Free Choice, and the peg is Berlin, each medium devises a
                        message best communicated through its instrument. The messages are carefully
                        related each to the other and each supports the other. This results in a
                        multiplied opinion impact.</p>
                    <p>A much greater awareness of the function of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> has spread among senior U.S. operating officials in the
                        106 countries abroad where the Agency now has posts. Chiefs of mission now
                        know that the public affairs officer and his staff have a dual
                        responsibility: (1) to advise the mission on the psychological implications
                        in the country of U.S. policies, plans and actions and (2) to serve as the
                        information, cultural and psychological link between the mission and the
                        people of the host country.</p>
                    <p>Since the spring of 1961 the Agency has increasingly emphasized operations in
                        Africa and Latin America and because of these priorities has had to curtail
                        somewhat its operations in Western Europe where normal communications with
                        the U.S. are relatively full and open. The Agency has opened 12 new mission
                        posts and eight branch posts in Africa in this period; 11 new branch posts
                        in Latin America; two mission posts and one branch post in the Far East; one
                        mission post and two branch posts in the Near East; in Western Europe,
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> closed four branch posts and
                        opened one new one.</p>
                    <p>To assist the African area in its tasks of organizing many new posts, the
                        Agency has conducted in Africa a series of training workshops for local
                        employees. These have covered subjects such as office practices, maintenance
                        and operation of motion picture projectors, the establishment and operation
                        of a library, techniques of handling small exhibits, and the servicing of
                        multilith presses.</p>
                    <p>The Agency has become increasingly effective in acting as a catalyst in
                        producing the maximum favorable impression overseas out of the travels
                        abroad of prominent American Government officials, and others. <gloss

                    <p>In February, 1963 the short wave power of the Voice of America was doubled. A
                        giant new transmitter complex—nearly five million watts, equal to the
                        broadcast power of 96 of the top U.S. commercial radio stations—was
                        completed at Greenville, North Carolina. This complex gives <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> a far better signal to Latin America,
                        Europe and Africa.</p>
                    <p>Four highly versatile air-transportable transmitters have been constructed
                        and put into operation. Three are near Monrovia. They provide an interim
                        signal to Africa south of the Sahara until a large permanent transmitter
                        complex of 1.6 million watts is completed in March, 1964. The fourth, on
                        Marathon Key off Florida, beams medium wave broadcasts to Cuba.</p>

                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s short wave broadcast service include:
                        consolidation of Chinese-language casts by eliminating Amoy and Cantonese
                        and concentrating on Mandarin, the principal language on the mainland and on
                        Formosa; inauguration of Portuguese broadcasts to Brazil; increase of
                        Spanish broadcasts to Latin America from one hour to nine hours daily;
                        inauguration of dictation-speed newscasts in Spanish and Portuguese to
                        facilitate wider diffusion by the printed word; considerable increase in the

                    <p>Other <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> construction advances: (1) the
                        first of six new transmitters at Woofferton, England—increasing <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> power there fivefold to 1.25 million
                        watts—goes on the air shortly; (2) relay facilities aboard Coast Guard
                        Cutter, Courier, are being land-based on Island of Rhodes where the Near
                        East Arabic services are being concentrated; (3) agreements for
                        relay-transmitter installations were made with Greece and the Philippines;
                        (4) relay facilities in the U.S., at Bethany, Ohio, and Delano and Dixon,
                        California are being modernized; (5) new antennas have been built for <gloss

                        Brentwood, Long Island, Schenectady, New York, and Wayne, New Jersey, were
                        retired from service.</p>
                    <p>The volume of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> short wave broadcasting
                        has increased nearly 30% since January, 1961: from 617’45” to 796’15” hours
                        weekly.</p>
                    <p>The volume of placement on overseas medium wave transmitters of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>-produced tapes has increased more than
                        150% since January, 1961: from 5,457 to 14,000 hours weekly. Some 5,500
                        radio stations in the free world, both commercial and government-owned,
                        carry such <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> taped programs.</p>
                    <p>Twice the Voice of America has massed its transmitters to deliver to
                        listeners behind the Iron Curtain an electronic Sunday punch consisting of
                        vital information which Communist governments had been denying their people.
                        The first: November 5, 1961, employing 52 transmitters, 4.3 million watts
                        and 80 frequencies during an eight-hour period. It told the Russian people
                        of world-wide revulsion because the Soviets had callously broken the atomic
                        testing moratorium and resumed atmospheric tests. The second: October 25,
                        1962, employing the same strength and number of frequencies as the year
                        previous, to broadcast the full story of the crisis confrontation over Cuba.
                        In both cases, monitoring and the reports of correspondents in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> confirmed that, despite intensive
                        jamming efforts, the broadcasts got through to an immense audience.</p>

                    <p>Since March 1961 sixty-six films have been acquired from non-Agency sources
                        at little or no cost. For its “packets” of films of specialized subjects,
                            <gloss target="#t_IMS_1">IMS</gloss> acquired 1,173 prints, and 801 more
                        prints are on loan for field use. It is estimated that acquisition
                        activities during <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1963 saved <gloss
                            target="#t_IMS_1">IMS</gloss> $501,097. Sources for these films were
                        several organizations, societies and associations, hospitals, doctors and
                        institutions, trade unions, government agencies, foundations, museums and
                        private industry. Among the more outstanding films acquired were:
                        “Agriculture <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>”, “Project Telstar” and
                        “The <persName corresp="#p_GJH_1">John Glenn</persName> Story.”</p>
                    <p>The Agency is now placing special emphasis on one-reel documentaries because
                        this type of picture is relatively easy to place in public theaters, whereas
                        lengthy films are rarely accepted by theaters. Strong evidence of the
                        success of this operation is the report from <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"

                        The report concerns “Horizons”, the news magazine for Latin America.

                        issuing “Horizons” as two separate one-reel productions per month instead of

                        issues. The audience for the two-reel version was 50,400, whereas the two
                        10-minute issues were placed in a total of 18 principal theaters in Santiago
                        and were seen by 132,500.</p>

                        seminars under the leadership of outstanding American scientists. Their
                        purpose is to emphasize U.S. pre-eminence in science; the relationship of

                        examine long-term values and aspirations as well as current views. In 1963
                        the Agency’s Survey Research Division conducted its <pb n="399" facs="0436"

                        substantial increase in field commissioned research projects, including
                        pre-testing of media materials and studies to determine the impact of

                    <p>The Agency’s research staff has stimulated applicable study by independent

                        been the chief fields of exploration under this program. Research findings
                        are being used to help tailor Agency information output.</p>
                    <p>Communist propaganda reporting and analysis now is handled on a daily basis.
                        An early morning briefing from the overnight files informs key Agency
                        officials on the latest Communist propaganda lines. Soviet and Cuba
                        specialists prepare daily reports summarizing the foreign and domestic
                        output from Moscow and Havana. Interviews with refugees and travelers from
                        Communist countries have been utilized to probe public opinion in nations
                        closed to us. By this method the Agency has acquired some indications of
                        popular attitudes and communications habits in the Communist orbit.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s research library has introduced an automatic punch-card system
                        of procurement, which reduced overtime and cut out hundreds of man hours
                        spent annually in typing and filing. New equipment has speeded the
                        transmission of materials between the library’s several branches and has
                        made file materials more readily available to operating services. Two new
                        library branches were opened. One is the Foreign Correspondents’ Center, a
                        reference and circulating library near the United Nations headquarters in
                        New York. The other is a limited collection selected for the particular
                        benefit of Agency trainees.</p>

                    <p>During the past two years, American business and individuals have given the
                        Agency a considerable volume of materials, otherwise <pb n="400" facs="0437"
                            xml:id="pg_400"/>unobtainable because of budget limitations, which were
                        essential in overseas posts for initiating and welding a relationship with
                        priority audience groups. Examples:</p>
                    <p>About half of all donated books are now carried overseas free by several
                        major steamship lines: in the past two years some 800,000 books were shipped
                        this way. At no charge, U.S. truckers are also moving impressive quantities
                        of books and other materials from points of donation to the Agency’s
                        Brooklyn and Washington warehouses where they are screened and shipped.</p>
                    <p>Last Spring the U.S. Post Office Department agreed to give the Agency all
                        books received in its 14 dead letter centers—100,000 to 150,000 annually.
                        Most are new books, delivered by the Post Office to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> warehouse in Washington at no cost to
                        the Agency. Some 150 wives of Agency officers have volunteered a half-day or
                        more a week to sort and pack them. Supervised by a professional librarian,
                        they so far have selected about 60,000 volumes for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> use overseas. These include new high-quality reference
                        works, texts, publications suitable for special presentations, as well as
                        fine groups of American fiction, both hard and paper backed.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s cooperative effort with American
                        industry to inform U.S. businessmen stationed abroad on critical issues of
                        American foreign policy now enters its third successful year. Over 8,000
                        such businessmen receive from their home office briefing material supplied
                        by the Agency to 441 international companies. The most recent was on the
                        Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; it reached recipients while international interest
                        in the treaty was at its peak.</p>
                    <p>For the past year the Agency has operated an editorial exchange program with
                        company and professional association publications that circulate overseas.
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> provides those publications with
                        feature and policy materials for background, and will also suggest articles
                        that will help to convey U.S. objectives to overseas readers. More than a
                        million people are reached by the 67 American private publications now
                        receiving such Agency material. In exchange, the Agency obtains, without
                        cost, industrial and association material of value to Agency editors and
                        writers. Additionally, a hundred exceptionally high quality publications,
                        showing the achievements of American business, science and technology, are
                        now received monthly or quarterly for distribution to <gloss

                    <p>The increasing need for sports equipment abroad led to the creation of an
                        International Sports Kit Project in cooperation with the People-to-People
                        Sports Committee. Begun in September 1962, the project resulted in requests
                        for more than 12,700 Sports Kits from <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        posts in 86 countries. During the first year U.S. organizations and
                        individuals donated 250 Sports Kits valued at $7,000 for distribution by
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts <pb n="401" facs="0438"
                            xml:id="pg_401"/>in 50 countries. Recent promotional efforts are
                        expected to result in a significant increase in the giving of Sports Kits.
                        Within a price range of from $12 to $64, the six kits provide equipment for
                        boxing, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer and basketball.</p>
                    <p>Emphasis in the donated books and magazine program has shifted from used to
                        new material. Most of the 800,000 donated books shipped overseas by the
                        Agency last year were new. In addition, the Book-of-the-Month Club has
                        donated full subscriptions to 700 foreign libraries recommended by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts. To avoid duplication and achieve
                        greater effectiveness, a joint <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-Peace
                        Corps Donated Book Pool has been established to solicit book donations and

                        book needs. While the magazine newsstand program continues at the 2,000,000
                        annual new magazine level, greater stress has been placed on technical and
                        professional journals such as medical journals or the Scientific
                        American.</p>
                    <p>Agency officers and executives of American companies with international
                        operations have been meeting to delineate areas of mutual interest. These
                        discussions, with over 150 companies, have served two purposes: first, to
                        encourage these industries to identify their overseas activities with the
                        economic and social development of the countries where they are operating,
                        and second, to explore the possibilities of cooperation abroad between
                        industry and Agency representatives. In this connection, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Public Affairs Officers are now visiting
                        the home offices of companies with substantial operations in the countries
                        where these officers are stationed.</p>
                    <p>Just over a year old, and now managed by a private non-profit corporation,
                        the “Books <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” program allows Americans to
                        purchase packets of 10 selected paperback books, at $4.00, for distribution
                        abroad by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and the Peace Corps. This
                        project, which requires no appropriated funds, takes advantage of the “at
                        cost” basis on which many paperback publishers are prepared to make good
                        books available, and it allows <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        control of distribution and presentation according to current target
                        priorities.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">TRAINING</p>
                    <p>The Agency has expanded the training program for junior officers to include
                        the eight week, basic officers course at State’s Foreign Service Institute.
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers thus receive essentially
                        the same basic preparation as do junior diplomats. At the same time, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has the opportunity of indoctrinating
                        future ambassadors in the role of the Agency. This is done through
                        professional contributions to the curriculum and by the presence and actions
                        of Agency junior officers participating in the courses.</p>
                    <p>The Agency has also increased its participation in the mid-career course from
                        four or five officers a year to 20 or 25. With <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> assistance the course of instruction has been completely
                        revised. Slightly over half of the Foreign Service Officers of this Agency
                        are in grades R–5 and R–4. Training opportunities, other than language, for
                        officers at this level are limited. For this reason <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> attaches great significance to the
                        mid-career officers course and hopes to increase its participation in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Substantial changes have been made in the training and placement of junior
                        officers. In addition to the basic officers course, language training is
                        heavily emphasized. Approximately 70% of the Agency’s junior officer
                        trainees now receive six months of language instruction before leaving for
                        the field. Of these, 50% are trained in languages other than French, German
                        and Spanish. Every junior officer now gets a basic course in the language of
                        his training post; previously, European languages were stressed. A junior
                        officer is now assigned to his training post or area for at least one tour
                        of duty following his ten-month training period, unless there are overriding
                        reasons to the contrary. This is completely contrary to previous policy.
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has encouraged the Foreign
                        Service Institute to develop a series of short courses (six months or less)
                        in the so-called “hard” languages. Many <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> junior officers achieve phenomenal results from these
                        intensive studies and, when followed by living in the country for three
                        years, they develop a high degree of proficiency.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has organized a number of special
                        seminars and institutes for the domestic establishment of the Agency. These
                        have covered such topics as youth and student affairs, international labor,
                        U.S. efforts and accomplishments in space and the special seminar on
                        problems of developing areas. Approximately 1,200 employees of the Agency
                        have benefited from the program; for many it has been their first formal
                        Agency training.</p>

                    <p>During the past two and one-half years, the Press and Publications Service
                        has developed new directions in both the nature of its output and its
                        operational methods. In content, the major change has been in the emphasis
                        on five major themes, which are the framework for the bulk of the service’s
                        output. The main effort has been to create Press and Publications material
                        designed to emphasize the sources of strength on which U.S. foreign policy
                        is based. Simultaneously, material not linked to America has been
                        diminished.</p>

                        diffused. A Run of Paper color service has been initiated to provide
                        overseas publications with color separations on thematic subjects, which
                        greatly reduces reproduction costs and increases use.</p>
                    <p>Picture service on chief-of-state visitors has been speeded. The old
                        presentations albums that took a minimum of two months to produce have been
                        replaced with prestige leather portfolios presented to the visitor before he
                        leaves the United States to return home.</p>
                    <p>In graphics, the True Tales continuity strip is now being offered the field

                    <p>A series of cartoon-type booklets was devised to carry the Alliance for

                        America. Each booklet depicts actual happenings in color-drawing sequences.
                        They have been extremely effective, making necessary large volume reprints.
                        Twenty titles have been published. Nearly 20 million copies have been

                        <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Bureau. Coverage-in-depth, as opposed to
                        straight top of the news coverage, has increased, with the production of a
                        markedly greater number of backgrounders, situation pieces and interpretive
                        stories.</p>
                    <p>The volume of <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> content has been tightened
                        materially, but the Wireless Files have been expanded, largely in Africa. In
                        March, 1961, 91 posts were equipped for direct Wireless File reception, of
                        which only 18 were in Africa. In 1962, receiving equipment for 15 new
                        African posts was put into operation and a separate African regional file
                        was inaugurated. It started as a four-hour English transmission and now is
                        six hours in English and French to 30 countries. Jamaica, British Guiana,
                        Malaya, the Dominican Republic and Guayaquil also started getting the
                        Wireless File. Altogether, 111 posts now receive it.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> pamphlet output has sharpened its
                        political accent while reducing quantity which conforms with the Agency’s
                        role as the psychological arm of the Government in implementing foreign
                        policy. Consequently, much of the material once presented as Americana is no
                        longer used, except when it is essential as a means of suggesting a method
                        for action in other countries. Examples of this closer keying to major
                        current objectives were when the nuclear test ban treaty was under
                        negotiation, <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> quickly issued a number of
                        pamphlets in support; when Berlin was the hot issue, graphic pamphlets were
                        produced. Heavier emphasis on graphics resulted in a picture pamphlet on
                        Castro’s betrayal of the Cuban people. Currently a comprehensive
                        documentation of the Sino-Soviet split is being prepared.</p>
                    <p>In <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> mail features, science output has
                        doubled, with space developments by far the biggest subject, but with
                        increases also in subjects such as medicine, scientific applications in
                        industry and similar subjects of great interest abroad, particularly in
                        underdeveloped areas. Overseas rights have been acquired for material
                        produced under domestic commercial contracts with the Astronauts. The volume
                        of material on Civil Rights also has doubled in the past two years.</p>
                    <p>The number of <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> special packets, on such
                        subjects as “The U.S. Trade Expansion Program”, “Thirty Years of U.S. Social
                        and Economic Progress”, and “New Products and Processes in U.S. Industries”,
                        has <pb n="405" facs="0442" xml:id="pg_405"/>increased sharply. Much more is
                        being done to explain how the Democratic form of government assists and
                        benefits its citizens. For example, a series called “How the U.S. Government
                        Helps the People” has been running more than two years, and has developed
                        more than 30 byliners by heads of various Federal Agencies outlining
                        functions directly benefitting the citizen and the community. The effort to
                        explain America within a mutual frame of reference is being carried out in
                        the series, “Profile of an American”, which has included a school teacher,
                        doctor, farmer, steel worker and editor, among others.</p>
                    <p>In magazine reprints, a special service has been established to increase the
                        number and variety of articles with intellectual appeal, for use in <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>-produced scholarly magazines. This in
                        turn has led to servicing of more articles on public affairs by such
                        government policy-makers as <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Arthur Schlesinger,

                    <p>Special materials output by <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> has devoted
                        increasing attention to the international effects of Communism. For example,
                        an exhaustive series of articles was produced on Communist infiltration of
                        free nations, covering most of the world’s non-Communist nations. More is
                        being done on the Communist economic offensive to show how trade and aid are
                        used to promote purely political goals. The volume of background articles on
                        the Sino-Soviet split has increased, and they point out that the dispute is
                        primarily ideological and that the goals of world conquest remain
                        unchanged.</p>
                    <p>The Africa Branch of <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss> completed its
                        second year of operation last month. It now serves 33 countries through 47
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts. Thirty of them have radio
                        telephone and telegraph equipment to receive the daily bi-lingual file. A
                        small French staff provides French versions of both Wireless File and mail
                        materials. From its beginning, the Branch has carried a heavy load in
                        supplying copy on African visitors and other U.S. African firsts, and has
                        played a leading role in telling a frank but constructive and continuous
                        story of race relations in this country.</p>
                    <p>In September, 1963, secure teletype circuits were put into service between
                        the State and Agency wire rooms and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        assumed the responsibility for its own terminal processing. Reproduction
                        workloads were sharply reduced and delivery times, both in and out, greatly
                        improved.</p>
                    <p>A Regional Service Center was established in Mexico City in March, 1962. It
                        was staffed with editorial specialists directing their efforts to selected
                        audiences of labor, students, and self-help phases of the Alliance for
                        Progress. Their end products are in the form most suitable for the
                        transmitting media—finished printed material, lithographic negatives for
                        local printed reproduction and manuscripts of material designed for
                        placement in local magazines, newspapers, radio and television stations. Two

                        reducing costs. Services to using posts were increased and unit costs
                        reduced. Meanwhile, a survey of press requirements for West Africa was made
                        and the new posts were provided with minimum equipment for producing printed
                        materials.</p>

                    <p>Fiscal Year 1963 was the most productive year in the history of the Agency’s
                        book publishing program. One thousand two hundred and two editions totalling
                        10,850,000 copies were published in 36 languages.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s Latin American Book Translation Program was expanded
                        dramatically during the last two years, increasing from contracting of 64
                        editions in Spanish and Portuguese totalling 541,000 copies in fiscal year
                        1961 to contracting of 332 editions totalling over 3,500,000 copies in
                        fiscal year 1963. To insure that these vastly increased quantities of books
                        reach Latin American readers, a campaign to encourage vigorous commercial
                        promotion and sale of these books has been developed throughout the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>With the emergence of some 16 Sub-Saharan French-speaking colonies and
                        dependencies into independence, low-priced American book translations into
                        French became an important concern of the Agency. By July, 1963, over one
                        million copies of more than a hundred titles were available in French to
                        African readers at the equivalent of 20 cents a copy.</p>

                        textbooks have been translated into 18 languages and published and placed in

                        cumulate and list in an orderly fashion all the books recommended to <gloss

                    <p>The Agency compiled and issued periodic subject bibliographies and special
                        lists of books to assist <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers in
                        obtaining useful materials. Of particular importance were book lists on
                        modernization, labor, history, periodicals, a series entitled Focus U.S.A.,
                        and shorter lists on areas of particular Agency emphasis.</p>
                    <p>Books were selected to accompany the increasing quantity and range of
                        Agency-sponsored exhibits. These varied from large book collections shown in
                        Iron Curtain countries, to a model American book store for presentation in
                        the Middle East, and to smaller book displays which accompany exhibits
                        travelling throughout the Free World.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s American Studies program came of age with the publication of
                        “The United States of America, A Syllabus of American Studies.” This
                        “Syllabus”, along with complementary material on the University of
                        Pennsylvania certificate program, is helping to promote the growth of
                        American Studies at many posts around the world. By <pb n="409" facs="0446"
                            xml:id="pg_409"/>September, 1963, 63 posts had requested 1,883 sets of
                        the Syllabus for presentation to university libraries, education officials
                        and professors.</p>
                    <p>“Restatement of Purposes and Technique of Agency’s Cultural Packets” was
                        published in July 1961. In it the cultural operations division announced the
                        continued production of ghost-written lectures on those aspects of American
                        society, culture, history and government of interest to overseas audiences,
                        and of importance to the Agency’s over-all program.</p>
                    <p>Nineteen new information centers have been opened on the African continent
                        for an area total of 54. Two additional regional librarians have been
                        appointed, one for Dakar and former French West Africa, one for Brazzaville
                        and former French Equatorial Africa. This brings the total number of
                        librarians in Africa to six.</p>
                    <p>Collection of books in French have been increased considerably for
                        French-speaking countries with the institution and growth of the “Nouveaux
                        Horizons” series of low cost books in French for Africa. Over 100 titles in
                        this series are now on <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Library
                        shelves in Africa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">TELEVISION</p>
                    <p>The Agency has steadily increased its production of television programs to
                        meet the immense need and interest overseas. In Fiscal year 1963, slightly
                        more than 113 hours of programs on film and tape were produced compared with
                        101 hours in 1962. In 1963, 22 new positions were added in the Television
                        Service to improve the production, quality and capacity: 10 positions in
                        production, six on the technical staff, four in programming, and two in
                        administration. These additions, and the Agency acquiring its own production
                        equipment, have resulted in quality programs at costs lower than commercial
                        stations.</p>
                    <p>New <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> studios, nearing completion, will
                        permit <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to more than double the volume
                        of in-house productions. The new facilities will enable <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to do language adaptations, dubbing,
                        editing, original programming and transfer of programs from tape to
                        kinescopes. They also will make it possible to record audio and video direct
                        transmissions from any of the three networks via the leased circuits, to

                        many technical jobs that formerly had to be done under contract.</p>
                    <p>Agency productions and acquisitions have been placed on more than 40 new
                        stations world-wide since mid-1961.</p>
                    <p>A <pb n="410" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_410"/>series of 13 programs, entitled
                        “World Americana”, was recently produced especially for the Japanese
                        national television network. These programs described significant and
                        interesting aspects of American life—leisure time, the American housewife,
                        American youth, an American university and other subjects. Another targetted
                            <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> series, entitled “Personal Report”,
                        was inaugurated for Nigeria, using a Nigerian student in Washington as the
                        commentator. This series projected selected aspects of the American scene to
                        a Nigerian audience in terms comprehensible to them. Twelve programs have
                        been produced to date. In 1962 a series entitled “Washington Reports” was
                        started for Japan. This bi-weekly program features a Japanese correspondent
                        reporting on various current events of interest to Japan. Still another
                        series aimed for the Far East is “Washington Newsletter”, a monthly series
                        of reports to Thailand on events of interest in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In Fiscal 1963 a series of 13 half-hour Spanish-language programs, entitled
                        “The Experts Answer”, was inaugurated for Latin America. In this series,
                        Latin American newspaper correspondents question an American expert in the
                        fields of government, labor, industry, science and the performing arts. This
                        series has been sent to 19 Latin American countries for placement.</p>
                    <p>A 15-minute weekly public affairs type of <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>
                        show in Spanish and Portuguese, “Panorama Panamericano”, begun in 1961, has
                        been improved and streamlined. Today it is carried in 19 Latin American
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Two special film programs on the Alliance for Progress were produced in
                        Fiscal 1963. “Report from Colombia”, commemorating the first anniversary of
                        the Alliance for Progress, was sent to 17 Latin American countries; and
                        “Report from Venezuela”, on the subject of land reform, was distributed to
                        19 countries in Latin America for television and film showings. Recent films
                        dealing with Castro have included “Focus: Cuba”, “Cuba—A World Verdict”,
                        “The Lost Apple”, “Castro and Cuba”, among others, were produced and
                        distributed world-wide for both <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> and
                        motion picture showings.</p>
                    <p>Television correspondents from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden,
                        Holland and Italy are getting increased help from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> in producing programs on the United States. Notable among
                        these was a one-hour program produced in early 1961 by British Independent
                        Television on the <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>
                        administration, entitled “The New Americans”. It featured interviews of top
                        New Frontier officials and the President himself. The following year the
                        same network returned to produce, with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> assistance, a one-hour program on the United States
                        entitled “State of the Union”.</p>

                        has recently helped foreign television networks and stations include: two

                        International” with the <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss>; a program on
                        the U.S. space effort entitled “Destination Moon”; a series to consist
                        eventually of 13 programs on the United States by the French National
                        television; six programs on the United States by Finnish television; a
                        one-hour program on integration produced by Italian television; a series of
                        13 programs on science with Belgian television; a film documentary on the
                        history of the American Negro by French National <gloss target="#t_TV_1"
                            >TV</gloss>; a program on the space communities of Cape Canaveral and

                        U.S. space program for the new second German television network.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">ENGLISH TEACHING</p>
                    <p>Another major achievement has been the Agency’s “Let’s Learn English” series
                        which is or has been telecast in 37 countries to an audience of millions
                        around the world. Because of the phenomenal popularity of the programs a
                        second set called “Let’s Speak English” has been produced and a third is
                        planned for production in the near future.</p>
                    <p>“Science Reports”, a television series comprising two 15-minute program
                        segments per month and featuring achievements in science and technology in
                        the U.S., is currently telecast in 52 countries around the world.</p>
                    <p>The first two volumes of a six-book English Teaching textbook series were
                        produced under contract with the National Council of Teachers of English and
                        the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. A new English teaching quarterly, “The
                        English Teaching Forum”, is aimed at the overseas teacher of English.
                        Articles include both linguistic theory and practical classroom
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Because of the limited number of professionally trained linguists available,
                        the Agency has initiated a program whereby selected, outstanding teachers of
                        English with broad Agency experience are sent to a university to undertake
                        special studies in linguistics and the teaching of English as a foreign
                        language. A professional training program has also been instituted for
                        English teachers and binational center administrative personnel prior to
                        departure for overseas posts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PERSONNEL UTILIZATION</p>
                    <p>The Agency has made significant progress in the more effective utilization of
                        women officers. One woman has risen to the FSR–1 level, the highest career
                        grade in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>; another is the country
                        public affairs officer for Chile; a third opened and operated a country
                        program in Africa and is the only Agency officer to achieve a working
                        proficiency in Swahili. Another woman has become the Agency’s deputy budget
                        officer; the editor-in-chief of “America Illustrated” is a woman, and three
                        women officers have attained the GS–15 level.</p>
                    <p><pb n="412" facs="0449" xml:id="pg_412"/>Since the spring of 1961, the Agency
                        has made strides in developing fuller utilization of minority personnel and
                        in according them rank commensurate with their skills. Since that date, the
                        number of Negro officers of GS–12 or higher rank in the domestic service,
                        for example, has increased from one to seven. The number of Negro officers
                        in the foreign service has about doubled from the 1960 figure of two dozen.
                        Three country public affairs officers are Negroes. About 10% of all foreign
                        service officers of rank equal to GS–12 or above are Negroes.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers are participating in
                        Washington seminars on the “Problems of Developing Countries”, examining
                        techniques and materials that assist emergent countries to develop viable
                        political structures resistant to Communist and other hostile attempts to
                        subvert and weaken them. These seminars bring together some of the most
                        skilled and experienced U.S. and foreign personalities in the field.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers also actively participate in
                        both the Inter-Departmental Committee and the faculty responsible for the
                        Country Team Seminar on Problems of Development and Internal Security.
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> normally enrolls 12 senior
                        officers in each of the six sessions of this seminar and has one officer

                        also has a liaison officer attached to the faculty of the Army Special

                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> had no intention of using the <gloss

                        U.S. official. It was an <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> exclusive. And
                        it was far from useful.</p>
                    <p>However, I thought it should be brought to the attention of responsible
                        American officials. I telephoned <persName corresp="#p_CEH_1">Ned

                            xml:id="pg_414"/>Ned went to work on it. And a little after eight (p.m.)
                        o’clock, <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> led the Davis story with: High
                        U.S. officials expressed regret tonight that South Vietnam’s President

                        high government source said the administration repudiates an earlier view
                        expressed privately by an official that the brothers had reaped the harvest
                        of their own misdeeds. This does not represent the opinions of the top

                    <p><gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> did not carry this second story either,
                        as it also was unattributed to a specific official and single-sourced.</p>

                    <p>As you doubtless know, I am planning to leave Delhi November 10 for a brief
                        period of discussions in Washington. I certainly hope to see <persName

                        convalescence, I doubt if I should bother him about too many business
                        questions. I should like to see you, if you plan to be in Washington, and
                        take up the following matters.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Book Programs.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> has been giving a high priority to the
                        effort to bring out low-priced editions of American books in English and in
                        translation. Two years ago the effort cost $300,000 in rupees; last year it
                        was about $650,000, and it will reach the level of about $1,300,000 in this
                        fiscal year. That will mean about 3,000,000 volumes. I think this effort is
                        a very worthwhile undertaking and that the program should even increase.
                        Without staff adjustments, I understand that it easily could reach the level
                        of $2,000,000 in cost within the next few years. I know the problems <pb
                            n="415" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_415"/>of budget ceilings, and this amount
                        would represent a huge chunk of the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        budget. The question I think we should examine is whether there could be
                        additional sources of rupee funds to enlarge our successful book programs.
                        For example, for the relatively large textbook effort, should we seek funds
                        in the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> budget although leaving the
                        operation of the program under <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>? Would
                        it be advisable to seek a special appropriation in <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD_1">Luke Battle</persName>’s budget? Should we ask for
                        appropriations for a book publishing foundation in India? I should hope to
                        get your views and advice in this field.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Buildings.</p>
                    <p>I am a strong advocate of using our accumulation of PL–480 rupees for
                        worthwhile purposes before the value deteriorates too much. In India all of
                        our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> centers are in leased buildings,
                        and the fixed costs of the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> operations
                        are rising with the inflation. One of the wise uses for PL–480 rupee funds
                        would be a reasonable purchase and construction program for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> in the various cities in which it
                        operates. I understand that in 1962 the Mission proposed a comprehensive
                        undertaking which would cost about $9,000,000, mainly in rupees. This would
                        include the provision of government-owned housing for at least a small
                        percentage of the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers. I should
                        hope that the Agency would support a rational building program in the State
                        Department’s <gloss target="#t_FBO_1">FBO</gloss> budget before the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. English Teaching.</p>
                    <p>In communicating with many of the most knowledgeable Indians, we have
                        inherited a very great advantage in the English language. It would be
                        difficult to imagine what the Russians or the Chinese would give for such an
                        opportunity. However, despite Indian official concern about the problem, the
                        quality of English is deteriorating in India. I believe that we, the British
                        and others concerned should work out ways with the Government of India to
                        assist in the training of English teachers throughout the country. Such an
                        effort in the long range will serve well our foreign policy objectives. I am
                        not suggesting that this should necessarily be a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> undertaking. In answer to a letter from <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD_1">Luke Battle</persName>, I have proposed that we work
                        out a plan for cooperation with the British, the Ford Foundation (which is
                        interested) and others who might be concerned to promote the Indian
                        Government’s efforts in this field. This could be achieved, if we could get
                        the appropriation, through PL–480 rupee grants. My purpose in bringing the
                        subject up is to seek <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> support for the
                        idea.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Binational Library Foundation.</p>
                    <p>Some time ago a proposal was made for the creation of a binational library
                        foundation in India using some of our rupee funds for the <pb n="416"
                            facs="0453" xml:id="pg_416"/>promotion of libraries in the manner of

                            and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who funded the establishment of
                            public libraries throughout the United States.</note> at another period
                        in the United States. I do not suggest that this should be a <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> undertaking, but since it affects the
                        long-range effort in propaganda in the purest sense, I should like to get
                        your views. It is our thought that such a foundation could promote the
                        building of libraries, the provision of trained librarians, and the
                        installation of original book collections. Over a period of years, I suspect
                        we could wisely spend a few million of our accumulated rupees in an
                        undertaking of this kind. I realize that this also would take a special
                        appropriation, and I believe that both the Department and <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should have an interest in it.</p>
                    <p>I should like to discuss with you <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> in
                        general, but I have mentioned the foregoing points to let you know in
                        advance some of the matters on my mind. I shall look forward very much to

                    <p>You may recall that, after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1"
                            >Hodges</persName> returned from the trade fair at Brno, Czechoslovakia,

                        international trade fairs should be directed to the promotion of American
                        exports rather than to the transmission of an image of the <pb n="417"

                        into the question of our policy with regard to international
                        expositions.</p>
                    <p>As the government’s exhibit program operates now, it has two segments: <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Special International Exhibits Program
                            (<gloss target="#t_SIE_1">SIE</gloss>), and a separate Department of
                        Commerce program, with its own appropriations, specifically devoted to
                        staging exhibitions at international fairs where the principal purpose is
                        the promotion of American exports. In this second category—which includes,
                        for example, most fairs in Western Europe—Commerce already determines the
                        site, theme and content of the exhibits. The only question is whether
                        Commerce should also control the part of the trade fair program now assigned
                        to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>—which would include particularly
                        fairs behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>The Bureau of the Budget has been fully into this matter and believes that,
                        where fairs are primarily significant for political and psychological rather
                        than for economic reasons, they should remain the responsibility of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d145">Document 145</ref>.</note> The State Department
                        agrees. So do I. The legislative history, the language of both enabling and
                        appropriating legislation, and expressions of Presidential intent (as in
                        your letter to <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Ed Murrow</persName> of August
                        11, 1961)<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">See <ref target="#d45">Document
                                45</ref></note> also support this position.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for keeping this category of fairs in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> hands are briefly as follows:</p>
                    <p>1) National exhibits have become a significant weapon of political warfare.
                        Often it serves <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests to have an
                        exhibit at a trade fair where the prospects of actual sales would not
                        warrant <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> participation.</p>
                    <p>2) Our interests in this area are better served when the exhibit is planned
                        with political and psychological purposes in mind than when it is a
                        haphazard and conglomerate commercial show without a coherent message. A
                        strictly commercial show might even reinforce Communist stereotypes about
                        American materialism and the poverty of American culture.</p>
                    <p>3) Obviously trade promotion must be an element, and this element should be
                        strengthened when possible; but in this category of fairs it should not be
                        allowed to dissipate or subvert the major propaganda purpose.</p>
                    <p>My conclusion, in short, is that the present policy regarding trade fairs is
                        correct, and that there is no reason to change it.</p>

                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The unity of God, the oneness of the universe, the
                            brotherhood of man, the age old articles of faith of the people of Islam
                            have begun to acquire new meaning today in the life of the young nation
                            of Pakistan, a national homeland for the Muslim people. Inheritors of a
                            tradition and a culture whose roots go deep into the ancient past,
                            Pakistanis look to their faith to guide their nation’s future.</p>
                        <p>“Our people seek equality, solidity, and freedom,” were the words of
                            Pakistan’s poet philosopher, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, who lies buried at the
                            great Badshahi Mosque in the ancient city of Lahore. Three centuries
                            have gone by since Aurangzeb, last of the great mogul emperors, entered
                            Lahore on the back of an elephant. The 20th century has brought new
                            techniques to Pakistan. It has brought new friends—Field Marshal
                            Muhammad Ayub Khan, president of Pakistan, Malik Amir Mohammad Khan,
                            governor of West Pakistan, and United States Ambassador Walter P.
                            McConaughy greet Mrs. John F. Kennedy, wife of the 35th President of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>Pakistan has played host to kings and to queens, to prime ministers and
                            to presidents. For the first time in its history, Pakistan offers its
                            proverbial hospitality to the wife of a president. And at the United
                            States Embassy, Ambassador McConaughy welcomes his visitor from 9,000
                            miles away. United in many fields, Pakistan and the United States, a
                            variety of cultures and of traditions, come together in friendship and
                            in common cause.</p>
                        <p>The tradition of independence is close to the hearts of freedom-loving
                            people everywhere. Mrs. Kennedy and her sister, Princess Lee Radziwill,
                            join in the celebration of Pakistan Day. Mrs. Kennedy honors the memory
                            of the founder of the Pakistan homeland. “Two nations striving for
                            independence and freedom,” said Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, “the
                            United States democracy has acted as a beacon light and an
                            inspiration.”</p>
                        <p>750 miles southwest of Lahore on the shores of the Arabian Sea lies the
                            port city of Karachi. From the busy city streets rises a realistic
                            monument to the Khardiazm’s belief in his country’s strength, the modern
                            State Bank of Pakistan, a symbol of economic freedom and of faith in a
                            nation’s future. The future of any nation, young or old, lies with her
                            children. The children’s wing of the Jinnah Central Hospital, largest in
                            Pakistan, receives the cooperation and support of many nations. The
                            mother of two young children, Mrs. Kennedy knows what it means to bring
                            a smile to the face of a sick child.</p>
                        <p>Among the gifts and the equipment she has brought from the United States
                            to Jinnah Hospital, not the least is Mrs. Kennedy’s own delight in
                            making a new young friend. Never far from Pakistan’s hope for the future
                            are her memories of the past. Through the ancient streets of Peshawar,
                            gateway to Pakistan’s northwest frontier, Mrs. Kennedy follows the route
                            history followed. Qissa Khawani, the bazaar of the storytellers, for
                            centuries a meeting place of soldier and tribesmen, of merchant and
                            scholar on their way down the long stretch of perilous road from the
                            mountain reaches of the Khyber Pass.</p>
                        <p>Descendants of the tribesmen of all still guard the bleak approaches to
                            the pass. The tribal Malik still welcome friends in the traditional way

                        <p>In the search for identity, for purpose, and for a place in the 20th
                            century, Pakistan has not forgotten man’s need to dream. Over 300 years
                            ago, the Shalimar Gardens brought repose to a Mughal emperor. Today, the
                            gardens offer repose and delight to anyone who seeks it.</p>
                        <p>JACQUELINE LEE KENNEDY ONASSIS: I must say I profoundly impressed by the
                            reverence, which you in Pakistan have for your art and for your culture
                            and for the use that you make of it now. My own country, even too, have
                            a pride in their traditions, so I think as I stand in these gardens,
                            which were built long before my country was born, that that’s one more
                            thing that binds us together and which always will.</p>
                        <p>I was sad to have to say goodbye so soon to President Ayub, to the
                            Governor of West Pakistan, and to the people of this vital and beautiful
                            country. I had always heard of Pakistan’s proverbial hospitality, and it
                            was even more than I had expected. I hope that with my husband, I will
                            be able to return again soon for a visit with the people of West
                            Pakistan and East Pakistan, too.</p>

                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: India, a country as ancient as it is modern, moving as
                            history moves across the threshold of the past. For 5,000 years, wave
                            after wave of the peoples of Asia have streamed across India’s
                            borders.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Conquerors, immigrants, soldiers, holy men, and
                            scholars—pilgrims of many creeds and of many races have woven their
                            customs, traditions, and beliefs into a continuous and intricate pattern
                            of civilization and of beauty. They have farmed and they have fought.
                            They have loved and they have prayed. They have thought and they have
                            played. They have built monuments and palaces and temples and cities.
                            They have written poetry and they have sung songs for 5,000 years.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: And they have moved as history moves into the
                            contemporary world of today.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Delhi has been called the City of Seven capitals, the
                            seat of power of seven ancient dynasties. New Delhi is now the seat of
                            power of India’s Democratic Republic.</p>
                        <p>In February of 1962, the world’s largest democracy went to the polls for
                            the third time in the history of the 12-year-old Republic. Over 100
                            million voters cast their ballots in and for the democratic process, the
                            process of free elections. March 12, 1962, a new session of Parliament
                            opens.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Dr. Rajendra Prasad once more takes his place. The first
                            democratically elected successor to India’s past heads of state. India’s
                            first president.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Also on this day, March 12, 1962, India, her people, and
                            Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru expect a visitor.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: From a sister democracy 9,000 miles across oceans and
                            continents, accompanied by the American Ambassador Kenneth Galbraith,
                            comes Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of the 35th President of the United
                            States, and her sister, Princess Lee Radziwill, invited guests of the
                            prime minister and of his daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The first wife of an American president in office to come
                            to India, Mrs. John F. Kennedy, a lover of the arts and the mother of
                            two young children, has a special interest in the culture and
                            traditions, old and new, of the world she is about to enter.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Mrs. Kennedy brings to the people of India the greetings
                            of the people of our own country, the United States, also a people of
                            varied backgrounds and customs, of many faiths and races and
                            beliefs.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The United States Embassy in the center of New Delhi,
                            combining modern architectural techniques and ancient Indian motifs,
                            reflects the new world and the old, and the longstanding friendship
                            between our countries, between the United States and India.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, established
                            by an act of Parliament in 1956, provides a model for medical education
                            and research in India’s long struggle against illness and disease.
                            Mothers and children are pretty much the same around the world,
                            particularly mothers of sick children who know the value of a smile, a
                            touch of brightness.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: This is India, 1962. This, too, is India, 1962. Millions
                            of artisans in India’s villages and on India’s farms take part in a
                            planned program to preserve her cottage industries, to keep alive the
                            artistic traditions of centuries past, to establish training centers to
                            provide raw materials for the loom and the needle. Kings and emperors
                            and explorers of five centuries ago knew and treasured the silk of
                            Banaras.</p>
                        <p>Today, Mrs. Kennedy meets and talks with some of the weavers, the buyers,
                            and merchants of modern Banaras. Today the ancient art of weaving joins
                            the 20th century in a procession of silks, brocades, and muslins for
                            fashions that go round the world.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: In the marriage of old to new, the continuity of artistic
                            tradition moves in an unbroken line from the variety and richness of the
                            past to the living art of today. The life and the dreams of the people
                            of any country, the United States or India, can find their deepest
                            expression in the language of art.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Art reaches across many barriers, makes many friends. In
                            her own land, Jacqueline Kennedy has given a new place of importance to
                            the American artist. Mrs. Kennedy finds in the young Indian artists who
                            have come to meet her a welcome close to her heart.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>JACQUELINE KENNEDY: Mrs. Gandhi, my friend, it gives me great pleasure to
                            present to you today the children’s art carnival, a present to the
                            children of India from the International Council of the Museum of Modern
                            Art and the Asia Society. Its purpose is to stimulate the artistic
                            imagination of children, the artists of tomorrow. I’ve often noticed,
                            and especially this morning at the Bal Sahyog, that the art of children
                            is the same the world over. And so, of course, is our feeling for
                            children. I think it is good in a world where there’s quite enough to
                            divide people that we should cherish a language and an emotion that
                            unite us all. Thank you.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The distance from the prime minister’s gardens in the
                            center of modern New Delhi is measured not only in miles to Jaipur,
                            capital of the state of Rajasthan—</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: —it is also measured in years, taking the American
                            visitor on the first step of her journey into India’s past, to the land
                            of the Rajputs, of warrior and prince.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Elephants and emperors have always been friends. The
                            rocky road up the hill to the Amber Palace palace was once traveled on
                            the lumbering backs of elephants by Raja Man Singh I and his retinue of
                            court followers 350 years ago. Alexander the Great marched his armies
                            out of India with 200 elephants. Timur of Samarkand with nearly 1,000 a
                            long time ago.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh looked out from the terrace of the palace his
                            fathers had built and saw the pleasant plains below. He decided it was
                            time to come out of the fortified hills. In 1728, he built Jaipur, the
                            Pink City, one of the first planned cities of its day.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: No murmurs of discontent, if there were any, were allowed
                            to reach this monarch’s ears in the courtyards of the city palace or the
                            corridors of the Hawa Mahal, the Palace of the Winds. Maharajah Sawai
                            Jai Singh was a scientist. He preferred to think about the shape of the
                            Earth, the universe, and the stars.</p>
                        <p>[SINGING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Mrs. Kennedy’s journey continues back into time. Another
                            city, another age, another monument. The year, 1569.</p>
                        <p>[SINGING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The city, abandoned. The emperor, long since gone. The
                            monument remains. Marble and mother of pearl to honor the tomb of a
                            saint. In Fatehpur Sikri, the saint Salim Chishti prophesied that the
                            great emperor would have the son he dearly wanted. And so the story is
                            told, Akbar the Great did have a son, and his son had a son.</p>
                        <p>[SINGING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The monuments of India’s historical past do not, however,
                            belong to the past. They belong to each new day and to the people who
                            live it—to priest and to scholar, merchant and villager, to neighbor, to
                            stranger, to friend.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: This is the monument the son of the son of the great
                            Akbar built. A garden of cyprus, a pool of still water, and a dome of
                            pure marble. Behind a pierced marble screen, Emperor Shah Jahan entombed
                            the body of his dead wife. Three centuries have gone by, year by year,
                            hour by hour, the sky of India touching to immortality the tomb of the
                            emperor’s wife.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The Taj Mahal, an emperor’s monument to love and to
                            death. Banaras, a people’s monument as ancient as the sacred Ganges that
                            flows along its banks, a people’s monument to the life of India itself.
                            To the holy city of temples and of minarets, to the city of the sacred
                            river and to nearby Sarnath, where Lord Buddha preached his first sermon
                            more than 2,000 years ago, come millions of India’s pilgrims, come
                            India’s friends.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: The immense and sprawling life of Banaras is a reminder
                            that the people of India form 1/6 of the peoples of the world.</p>

                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: Furthest in time and in space from the start of the
                            American journey into India, the medieval city of Udaipur, with the
                            sunlight still falling on its ancient walls. Moving towards tomorrow,
                            the White City is already a seat of learning. And India’s five year plan
                            will bring further means of economic growth and modernization to its
                            people.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: A window on Udaipur’s Lake Pichola opens, and as in many
                            other parts of India, Mrs. Kennedy once more looks out on a changing
                            day, on a day of legendary beauty.</p>

                        <p>JACQUELINE KENNEDY: As I look back upon my journey through India, it is
                            with a feeling of great affection for this country and its people, and
                            for the prime minister, whose kindness made my visit possible. At the
                            end of every day, I could not decide which day was the best. Each day
                            brought new experiences, new friends, and a new welcome.</p>
                        <p>It was a wonderful surprise to meet our own American pioneers of the
                            Peace Corps so many miles from home. Going the unknown ways, in my
                            husband’s words, requires many gifts of character and a confident vision
                            of the future. I believe that both the people in India and we in our own
                            country share this vision.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>RAYMOND MASSEY: For the gentle man who went his way softly, no marble or
                            ivory monument is needed. Strong in spirit as he was frail in body,
                            Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial is in the hearts of his people, and in the
                            thoughts of those everywhere who seek to maintain freedom and to secure
                            peace.</p>

                        <p>CHARLTON HESTON: Five cities were silent in May. On the first morning of
                            the following month, they awoke with brushes in their hands and a
                            calendar as their canvas. God made the days. Man made the calendar. And
                            the five cities made June of 1963.</p>
                        <p>[THEME MUSIC]</p>
                        <p>4,800,000 people died in the month of June, and 9,600,000 people were
                            born. No one knows what names of future history are among those that
                            were born. But within the millions that died was Angelo Roncalli—Pope
                            John XXIII.</p>
                        <p>Outside St. Peter’s Basilica, the masses waited with meditation, tears,
                            and prayers. On June the 2nd, the vigil outside the Vatican was over.
                            Within the Basilica, the Cardinal College gathered for mass. Still in
                            grief, theirs was a mission to elect a man to follow their beloved Pope
                            John.</p>
                        <p>In the square, the crowds had received the signal they were waiting for.
                            And from all over Rome, they gathered to witness a single puff of white
                            smoke—a puff of smoke that told the world the election was over. The
                            name was Giovanni Montini, and the coronation would be on the 30th of
                            June.</p>
                        <p>Giovanni Montini chose to be called Pope Paul VI, and now his life would
                            be spent in the highest service to the 500,000,000 people of his
                            faith.</p>
                        <p>To the second city of June, foreigners, the press, and photographers were
                            not invited. Films were made available only for government sources. The
                            city’s name is unknown, but it is near Baikonur in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Here in the continuing race for the moon with the United States of
                            America, the Soviet Union launched Valery Bykovsky and Valentina
                            Tereshkova. In utmost secrecy, only the military and technicians
                            observed the launchings of the two new cosmonauts. The launchings of
                            June put the Soviet Union ahead in a race that was not forecast to be
                            over until the end of the decade.</p>
                        <p>[ROCKET LAUNCHING]</p>
                        <p>The history of man in space is short, but the conquests are many. Now
                            films of every launch have been released both by the government of the
                            Soviet Union and the free press of the world that was invited to
                            photograph the launches of the United States. In 1961, the Soviet Union
                            launched Yuri Gagarin and provided this motion picture of the
                            lift-off.</p>
                        <p>The United States launched Alan Shepard from Cape Canaveral on top of a
                            Redstone booster. Next in space was Gus Grissom of the United
                            States—again photographed by hundreds of international photographers at
                            the Cape. Then the Soviet Union announced the launch of Gherman Titov
                            and released this film.</p>
                        <p>In 1962, John Glenn went into orbit, launched from an Atlas booster at
                            Cape Canaveral. This was followed by United States astronaut Scott
                            Carpenter three months later in the Mercury capsule. In August of 1962,
                            Andriyan Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich orbited simultaneously, launched
                            by two separate boosters from the Soviet Union—one launched within 24
                            hours after the other. These are the films provided of the launches.</p>
                        <p>Wally Schirra of the United States went next from Cape Canaveral, perched
                            on top of a 1 and 1/2 stage Atlas. 1963 ushered Gordon Cooper of the
                            United States into orbit in his Faith 7 capsule. And June in space
                            belonged to the Soviet Union with Valery Bykovsky and Valentina
                            Tereshkova. The Soviet Union furnished this film of the launches.</p>
                        <p>The second city of June—location unknown—wrote history with two proud
                            names.</p>

                        <p>CHARLTON HESTON: The third city of June lived off the Saigon River in
                            South Vietnam. Its name was Ben Tuong. The village population lived from
                            products that surrounded the river, and they made use of every available
                            resource to uphold their strong, healthy, and happy lives they’ve known
                            so long.</p>
                        <p>Their village had existed for centuries. It continued to exist until one
                            night in June. On the night of the 18th, Communists came to spread their
                            political fervor and killed the men and burned the village. South
                            Vietnam soldiers were called to help save what could be saved, but it
                            was too late. All that was left to do was to take care of the wounded,
                            the frightened, and the homeless.</p>
                        <p>Their conquerors had come to Ben Tuong twice. Once they came by day as
                            friendly strangers with promises of a new life of communal living and of
                            more land. Then they came by night with their promises replaced by
                            flames, with their smiles replaced by pillage, and the villagers’
                            happiness replaced by murder. Ben Tuong would not be left deserted. On
                            the 21st, the army went back near Ben Tuong to route the communists
                            out.</p>
                        <p>[EXCITABLE MUSIC]</p>
                        <p>And so the soldiers came by rail, by air, by land, and water to win back
                            the remnants of Ben Tuong. Communists from the north were trying to
                            sweep the country. Ben Tuong was only a single step. In the month of
                            June, they had attacked 294 places. Their forces numbered 22,000 and
                            attacked not as a marching army but separately and distantly at isolated
                            villages throughout the country in guerrilla fighting and scattered
                            battles.</p>
                        <p>There were casualties in this unknown war of June, too many of them. But
                            the Communists were out fought, out equipped, and out soldiered. One by
                            one out of their hiding places in the thickets, they surrendered. But
                            the ones that got away went on to other villages, and South Vietnam
                            remained a battlefield.</p>
                        <p>[SLOW MUSIC]</p>
                        <p>The eyes of the world shifted to the small city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
                            within the Deep South of the United States of America. It was a familiar
                            story. It started before the war between the states 100 years ago, which
                            was fought and won for Negro equality. Negroes were taken out of
                            slavery, and their freedom was guaranteed. But barriers were put in
                            front of them, especially within the states that had lost that Civil
                            War, the states of the southeast.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution of the United States came under debate as to whether it
                            prohibited or acknowledged such barriers. In 1954, it was made clear by
                            the Supreme Court that the Constitution guarantees equality for all. And
                            so the great tests were made, tests that brought mob disorder and
                            violence to the south and that required federal troops to ensure the
                            admittance of Negro students into schools other than those reserved for
                            Negroes only.</p>
                        <p>Though the vast majority of the United States was in sympathy with the
                            Negro, some of the citizens were not. Though the United States
                            Government supported the Negro, some of the separate state governments
                            did not. And now the test of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the last state of the
                            Deep South to resist integration of schools.</p>
                        <p>[ANGRY PROTESTING]</p>
                        <p>Once again, the governor of the southern state said no Negro shall be
                            admitted to an otherwise white enrollment. And with the entire world as
                            witness, judge, and jury, Tuscaloosa and history met on June the 11th
                            when two American Negroes expressed their desire to enroll at the
                            University of Alabama. It was, in effect, a single defiant man, holding
                            with strength to the weak mores of the past against the Constitution,
                            the government, and the will of the people of the United States, both
                            Negro and white. With the protection of federal marshals, Vivian Malone
                            and James Hood entered the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.</p>
                        <p>[UPLIFTING MUSIC]</p>
                        <p>There was no violence. The governor conceded. The law of the land was
                            enforced by the government to protect two citizens. It was enforced so
                            Vivian Malone and James Hood and anyone else would have the freedom to
                            choose the school they would attend.</p>
                        <p>This was not the end of race problems in the South, but the government
                            and the people had made clear that the Negro is an equal citizen and is
                            entitled to and shall get freedom of choice. Wherever free men live,
                            their most sacred request, their most sacred right is for freedom of
                            choice, to bypass all prejudice, to live as they want to live, to
                            worship where they want to worship, and to go where they want to go.</p>

                        <p>CHARLTON HESTON: On the other side of this wall are millions of people
                            who aren’t going anywhere. The Communist government they live under will
                            not let them out. For centuries, walls have been built to keep out
                            invading armies, but this was the first wall in all recorded history to
                            keep an entire country from fleeing—fleeing into West Berlin as 3 and
                            1/2 million did before the wall was erected.</p>
                        <p>If the guards or their guns were unsuccessful in keeping people from
                            fleeing, there was the barbed wire. If they crossed that, there was the
                            wall. If they reached the top, there was the broken glass.</p>
                        <p>Over a hundred have been killed trying to cross. In June, 90 succeeded
                            and three were killed. All escape routes were reinforced.</p>
                        <p>The Eastern guards had orders to shoot at each other if one tried to
                            escape. In areas where windows overlooked West Berlin and people had
                            jumped to freedom, the windows had been sealed with bricks.</p>
                        <p>The wall separated more than a city. It separated the world. On one side
                            lived people who were free to be Christians or Muslims, Buddhists,
                            Hindus, Jews, or Confucians. On the other side lived people whose
                            expression of any religion was discouraged or taken away.</p>
                        <p>On June 26, a short distance from the wall and overlooking the East, the
                            people of West Berlin welcomed a visitor—the President of the United
                            States of America.</p>

                        <p>PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>There are many people in the world who really don’t understand, or say
                            they don’t, what is the great issue between the free world and the
                            Communist world. Let them come to Berlin!</p>
                        <p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
                        <p>There are some who say—there are some who say that Communism is the wave
                            of the future. Let them come to Berlin!</p>
                        <p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
                        <p>And there are even a few who say that it’s true that Communism is an evil
                            system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Lasst sie nach
                            Berlin kommen! Let them come to Berlin!</p>
                        <p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
                        <p>Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have
                            never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from
                            leaving us.</p>
                        <p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
                        <p>While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the
                            failures of the Communist system for all the world to see, we take no
                            satisfaction in it. For it is, as your mayor has said, an offense not
                            only against history but an offense against humanity, separating
                            families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters and
                            dividing up people who wish to be joined together.</p>
                        <p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
                        <p>Freedom is indivisible. And when one man is enslaved, all are not free.
                            All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin. And
                            therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, “Ich bin ein
                            Berliner.”</p>

                        <p>MR. HESTON: June was over. With a crown, a rocket, a gun, a triumph, and
                            a wall, five cities wrote history in the book of the world. Prophets
                            could guess, wise men could warn, but no visionary of June could
                            foretell the cities that were destined to write their names on future
                            calendars.</p>
