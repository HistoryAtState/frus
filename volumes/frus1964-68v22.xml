                <p>(This is not an official statement of policy by the Department of State; it is
                    intended only as a guide to the contents of this volume.)</p>
                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series Foreign Relations of the
                    United States has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and
                    diplomacy of the United States. Historians in the Office of the Historian
                    collect, arrange, and annotate the principal documents comprising the record of
                    American foreign policy. The standards for the preparation of the series and the
                    general deadlines for its publication are established by the Foreign Relations
                    of the United States statute of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). Volumes
                    in the Foreign Relations series are published when all the necessary editing,
                    declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
                    Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of
                    the relevant Departmental units. The volume also includes records from the
                    Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, the
                    editor made extensive use of the Presidential and other papers at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library in Austin, Texas.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The
                    Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services, Bureau
                    of Administration, Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices
                    in other agencies or governments, carried out the declassification of the
                    selected documents.</p>
                <p>The following is a summary of the most important of the issues covered.
                    Parenthetical citations are to numbered documents in the text.</p>
                <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                <p>The Johnson administration continued the Kennedy administration's support for
                        <persName corresp="#p_PMR1">Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi</persName> of Iran
                    and its emphasis on buttressing Iran's internal security by encouraging a
                    far-reaching program of political, social, and economic reform—the Shah's
                    so-called “White Revolution.“ U.S. policymakers, who agreed on the strategic
                    importance of Iran, which was on the southern periphery of the Soviet Union,
                    remained concerned over potential threats to the long-term stability and
                    viability of the Shah's regime. Iran was also valued as one of the most
                    dependable U.S. allies in the region. Unlike many other Third World leaders, the
                    Shah supported U.S. policies in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and other
                    sensitive Cold War areas. Johnson's personal relationship with the Shah, which
                    dated from his trip to Tehran as Vice-President in August 1962, was closer than
                    Kennedy's had been. The two leaders corresponded frequently, and the Shah met
                    with Johnson three times during his presidency.</p>
                <p>The only real bone of contention between the two countries was the Shah's
                    seemingly insatiable appetite for more and newer military equipment. Thus, the
                    continuing U.S. advocacy of Iranian economic development and reform as a check
                    against internal upheaval or revolution was offset by the Shah's insistence on
                    spending more of Iran's growing oil revenues on weapons.</p>
                <p>On January 7, 1964, the Shah sent the President a letter pointing to an
                    increasing Arab threat to Iran and arguing that the September 1962 U.S.
                    Five-Year Military Plan for Iran had already proved inadequate. (2) In his March
                    19 response, the President noted that, because of Iran's exposed position, the
                    U.S. Government had always taken the Shah's military concerns quite seriously,
                    but that it had concluded that the basic factors that had led U.S. military
                    experts to agree on the current Military Plan had not changed significantly
                    since 1962. (8) During subsequent discussions of a military modernization
                    program for Iran, U.S. officials continued to emphasize the importance of
                    assuring that such a program would not hamper Iran's economic development
                    program, while the Shah insisted that increased oil revenues over the
                    foreseeable future would make it possible to pay for increased defense
                    expenditures without impairing Iran's economic progress. (14–17, 19, 22)</p>
                <p>When the Shah visited Washington in June 1964, the President complimented him on
                    his reform program and called Iran “the brightest spot in the Middle East.“ (36,
                    39) The Shah discussed his military modernization program in detail with U.S.
                    representatives, who assured him that the United States intended to be
                    responsive to his military needs. (37, 40–42) On July 3 Ambassador <persName
                        corresp="#p_HJC2">Julius Holmes</persName> was instructed to negotiate a new
                    Memorandum of Understanding on military modernization with the Shah, but to
                    emphasize U.S. concern that the program be kept within proper bounds in order
                    not to jeopardize Iran's economic development and to make it clear that the U.S.
                    Government intended periodically to examine jointly with the Government of Iran
                    the overall economic effects of its military expenditures. (45–48)</p>
                <p>Although U.S. policymakers remained concerned over potential threats to the
                    Shah's regime, Embassy reports indicated that that no clearly identifiable
                    threat to Iran's internal security was likely to develop in the near future,
                    except in the event of the demise or abdication of the Shah. (6, 18) A May 1964
                    National Intelligence Estimate (<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>) concluded
                    that the Iranian Government's vigorous suppression of widespread anti-government
                    demonstrations in June 1963 and its continuing strong pressure against religious
                    dissidents had severely weakened this segment of the opposition. (23)</p>
                <p>An upsurge of opposition to the government and anti-Americanism came in October
                    1964, however, when the Iranian Parliament, the Majlis, passed a status of
                    forces bill granting U.S. military personnel stationed in Iran and their
                    dependents full diplomatic immunity, as the United States had been requesting
                    since March 1962. When it voted less than two weeks later to accept a $200
                    million credit from U.S. commercial banks for purchase of U.S. military
                    equipment, critics claimed that passage of the status bill had been the price
                    exacted by the United States for the credits. (52, 54–55)</p>
                <p>On November 3 dissident religious leader <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Ayatollah
                        Khomeini</persName>, whose attacks on the status bill had included calling
                    for the overthrow of the Iranian Government, was arrested and exiled to Turkey.
                    (56, 58) Department of State analysts warned in January 1965 that <persName
                        corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s views were symptomatic of widespread
                    popular opposition to Government policies, recently extended to open criticism
                    of American policy in Iran, and that this new attitude posed a threat to U.S.
                    interests in Iran and made the U.S. task there far more difficult. (64)
                    Department officials disagreed, however, as to the extent of popular discontent
                    in Iran. (66–67)</p>
                <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> met with the Shah in
                    Iran in early April 1965, the Shah told him that his “White Revolution,” which
                    had been achieved without bloodshed, was supported by the nation, with the
                    exception of minor groups such as reactionary mullahs and dispossessed
                    landlords. (72) An assassination attempt on the Shah on April 10, however,
                    highlighted for the Embassy the fact that Iran's stability was unduly dependent
                    on the life of one man. (76, 78–80)</p>
                <p>Faced with the possibility of forced withdrawal from the U.S. facilities in
                    Pakistan, the President ordered in August 1965 that the U.S. Government proceed
                    urgently to develop alternative facilities in the region for the installations
                    in Pakistan. Top U.S. intelligence authorities subsequently concluded, over the
                    objections of Ambassador Armin Meyer, that Iran was technically the most
                    suitable site for relocation of most of this activity. The Ambassador emphasized
                    that if the United States wanted to expand its facilities in Iran, it needed to
                    improve the climate of U.S.-Iranian relations and remove its chief irritants. He
                    noted that the Shah had become increasingly resentful of the U.S. military aid
                    program, which extended grant aid to countries less faithful to the United
                    States than Iran, while requiring him to pay a high percentage rate for his
                    purchases. Meyer thus urged action to ensure that Iran received a truly
                    concessional interest rate for the second tranche of the military sales
                    agreement as soon as possible. (94–95, 98–100)</p>
                <p>The Shah continued to argue that successful economic development was useless
                    unless Iran had adequate military security. In September 1965 Meyer cabled
                    Washington that the Shah was unhappy with his dependence on the United States
                    for military supplies and would almost certainly begin to buy arms from non-U.S.
                    sources, possibly even the Soviet Union. (102, 105) In November <persName
                        corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> reported the Shah's complaints that the
                    U.S. Government had seriously misunderstood Iran's true military needs. The
                    Ambassador again urged approval of the long-delayed second installment of the
                    U.S. military credit sales program. Following U.S. approval on November 29, the
                    Shah began to push for a $200 million augmentation of Iran's military purchases.
                    (108–111, 114)</p>
                <p>In March 1966 letters to President Johnson, the Shah argued that Iran needed to
                    purchase more military equipment to maintain its political and economic
                    stability. (122, 126) Johnson's replies temporized, suggesting that a joint
                    annual military-economic review later that spring would help the Shah determine
                    how best to allocate Iran's resources and assuring him that the United States
                    also wished to promote Iran's goals of economic advance and national security.
                    (124, 129)</p>
                <p>Subsequent discussions within the U.S. Government, during which <persName
                        corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss> warned that the Shah would go elsewhere for arms purchases if
                    the United States would not sell, resulted in Presidential approval on May 23 of
                    $200 million in new arms sales to Iran over a four-year period. When Meyer
                    informed the Shah, he warned him that the President considered the new $200
                    million to be a planning figure which needed to be reconfirmed each year during
                    the annual review. (136–145) On May 30 the President signed <gloss
                        target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 348, “Alternatives to U.S. Facilities in
                    Pakistan,” approving a State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    recommendation to establish contingency alternatives in Iran for U.S. facilities
                    in Pakistan, in order to be in a position to move them on short notice with
                    little intelligence loss if necessary. (146)</p>
                <p>During subsequent negotiations on the arms purchase, the Shah emphasized that
                    Iran was free to purchase the arms it needed from other sources, including the
                    Soviet Union, while U.S. officials warned that there would be an adverse U.S.
                    reaction to any kind of military procurement from the Soviets. (145, 148–149,
                    151–154) On July 20, 1966, the President wrote the Shah that the U.S. Government
                    was considering providing two squadrons of F–4 aircraft, but that an
                    Iranian-Soviet arms arrangement would create serious problems in carrying
                    forward U.S. military assistance. On July 28 <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                        >Meyer</persName> cabled the President that the only hope of avoiding
                    excessive Iranian military involvement with the Soviets would be to offer Iran
                    better prices and terms. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also urged that every effort
                    be made to prevent the Soviets from gaining a foothold in Iran. (158, 160–161,
                    165–166)</p>
                <p>In August 1966 the President decided to send Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    Defense for International Security Affairs Townsend Hoopes to Tehran to explain
                    the budgetary limitations on U.S. military aid, and to offer reduced costs and
                    accelerated delivery wherever possible. Hoopes was also to make it clear,
                    however, that the U.S. offer to sell F–4's and missiles was conditioned on
                    clarification of Iran's position on buying from the Soviet Union. (168–171)
                    During his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> on August 10, the Shah promised
                    not to allow Soviet technicians in Iran. (172) During subsequent negotiations on
                    the military package, the Shah assured U.S. representatives that he would not
                    buy <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s or other sophisticated military
                    equipment from the Soviets. (174–176) Iran's decision in January 1967 to
                    purchase some less sophisticated military equipment from the Soviet Union led to
                    U.S. protests, but did not derail the U.S.-Iranian arms deal. (185, 191–192) In
                    May 1967, the President approved the second $50 million slice of the $200
                    million military sales credit. (199, 201)</p>
                <p>When the Shah visited Washington in August 1967, the President assured him that
                    the United States would do everything possible to meet his needs, but warned
                    that the mood of Congress made it difficult for him to make firm promises
                    regarding future military aid. The Shah left Washington well pleased with his
                    reception and with the praise he had received for Iran's economic and social
                    progress under his rule. (232–233, 235– 236)</p>
                <p>On November 15 the Shah wrote the President concerning two new projected
                    five-year plans for Iran—one for economic development and one for reorganization
                    of Iran's armed forces. He noted that a rough estimate of the requirements for
                    military equipment to carry out this reorganization was in the order of $800
                    million, and that Iran would like to buy this equipment in the United States if
                    the U.S. Government could offer the necessary credit arrangements. (242)</p>
                <p>On December 19 the President wrote to the Shah that the U.S. Government was ready
                    to begin discussions on the third $50 million credit installment and intended to
                    seek Congressional approval for the fourth installment at the appropriate time.
                    As he had told the Shah in August, the United States would continue to do its
                    best to be helpful, but he could not say definitively what it could do beyond
                    the existing agreements. The President also expressed concern over the
                    contemplated large size of the projected military program. (254)</p>
                <p>In April 1968 <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName
                        corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and Rostow supported an
                    interdepartmental recommendation for a 6-year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                    1968–1973), $600 million military credit sales package for Iran, with a U.S.
                    offer of a military credit sales program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                    1968 between $75 million and $100 million. Rostow reminded the President that
                    the military sales package would be uppermost on the Shah's mind when the two
                    men met in June. Johnson gave his approval on May 1. (271–273, 277, 279–281)</p>
                <p>When <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> informed the Shah of U.S.
                    approval of the new military credit sales program, the Shah told him that Iran's
                    immediate military needs would exceed $100 million and that if U.S. credits for
                        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 were restricted to $75 million,
                    orders for at least $25 million would have to be placed elsewhere. In early June
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Rostow informed the President
                    that the full $100 million could be made available for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                        >FY</gloss> 1968 and recommended that he so inform the Shah when they met.
                    Before and after his arrival in Washington, the Shah continued to stress that in
                    order to plan militarily, he needed assurances from the United States that it
                    would be able to meet his needs over the next few years. U.S. officials made it
                    plain that the U.S. political situation precluded long-term commitments, but
                    that the administration considered military cooperation with Iran a very high
                    priority and expected its successor to do so. (283–284, 287, 290, 292, 294–296,
                    299, 302, 304, 306)</p>
                <p>During his meetings with the President on June 11 and 12, the Shah made several
                    requests for various types of U.S. assistance, primarily military. On July 26
                    the President responded that he hoped and expected that Congress would continue
                    the agreed program of military cooperation with Iran, and that he would inform
                    his successor of the importance he attached to such cooperation. He offered
                    further U.S. cooperation in speeding up planning and construction of Iran's
                    radar and military communications systems. (295, 299–300, 305–307)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> reported that the Shah welcomed the
                    President's statement and said that if U.S. military credits were unavailable in
                    the future, he would attempt to purchase directly from U.S. companies, using
                    cash if necessary. (308) On October 19, however, <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                        >Meyer</persName> reported that Shah, who had recently returned from a trip
                    to the Soviet Union, had warned that if Congress acted to restrict credit sales
                    to Iran, he intended to purchase elsewhere. (311–312)</p>
                <p>As the Johnson administration drew to a close, an inter-agency review concluded
                    that the U.S. Government should continue to plan on the basis of $100 million in
                    annual U.S. military credits to Iran. (314) When Iranian Prime Minister
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> met with the President in
                    Washington on December 5, 1968, Johnson said that although he himself would only
                    be in office a short time longer, he believed that U.S. interests were such that
                    a close relationship between the United States and Iran would continue.

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States series</hi> presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume,
                    which was compiled in 1995–1996, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also apply these selection criteria in accordance
                    with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and

                <p>The editor of the volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign
                    policymaking process of the U.S. Government, with emphasis on the highest level
                    at which policy on a particular subject was determined. The documents include
                    memoranda and records of discussions that set forth policy issues and show
                    decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy
                    and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the
                    details of policy execution.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> made the major foreign
                    policy decisions during his presidency, and the editor sought to document his
                    role as far as possible. Although the foreign policy record of the Johnson
                    administration is voluminous, many internal discussions between Johnson and his
                    advisers were not recorded. The record of Johnson's involvement as well as that
                    of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in the policy
                    process often had to be pieced together from a variety of sources.</p>
                <p>The volume focuses on the issues that primarily engaged high-level U.S.
                    policymakers. Major topics include: 1) the efforts of President Johnson and U.S.
                    policymakers to retain a close relationship with the Shah of Iran; 2) U.S.
                    attempts to buttress Iran's internal security by encouraging a far-reaching
                    program of political, social, and economic reform; 3) the conflict between U.S.
                    support for Iranian economic development and reform as a check against internal
                    upheaval or revolution and the Shah's insistence on spending more of Iran's
                    growing oil revenues on weapons; 4) increased U.S. support for Iran's military
                    modernization program; 5) the upsurge of anti-Americanism and opposition to the
                    Shah's government following the October 1964 passage of a status of forces bill
                    granting U.S. military personnel stationed in Iran and their dependents full
                    diplomatic immunity; 6) U.S. efforts to prevent the Shah from buying arms from
                    non-U.S. sources, especially the Soviet Union; and 7) U.S. determination to
                    prevent the Soviet Union from gaining a foothold in Iran.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>from the General Editor and
                    the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as
                    possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editor for each document included
                    in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found
                    in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently
                    corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman
                    type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the source text, and a
                    list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="009"
                    />and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments.</p>
                <p>The declassification review of this volume, which was completed in 1998, resulted
                    in decisions to withhold from publication .2 percent of the documentation
                    selected. No documents were denied in full. The decision on one key intelligence
                    issue was appealed to a High-Level Panel consisting of senior representatives
                    from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, established in 1998 to determine whether or not a covert
                    activity could be acknowledged by the United States. The Panel arrived at a
                    determination on Iran that resulted in the release of most of the appealed
                    documentation. The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the
                    research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the
                    declassification review process described above, that the documentation
                    presented here provides an accurate account of U.S. policy toward Iran during
                    the 1964–1968 period.</p>

                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. When this volume was being compiled, the Department
                    of State records consulted were still under the custody of the Department, and
                    the footnotes citing Department of State files suggest that the Department is
                    the repository. By the time of publication, however, all the Department's
                    indexed central files for these years had been permanently transferred to the
                    National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park,
                    Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized office (or lot) files covering
                    this period, which the National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention,
                    are in the process of being transferred from the Department's custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President Johnson and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including
                    the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department
                    of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. Numerous White House memoranda, including
                    memoranda to the President, testify to President Johnson's concern with issues
                    relating to Iran, especially the maintenance of personal ties with the Shah. The
                    bulk of the foreign policy records at the Johnson Library are in the country
                    files and other component parts of the National Security File.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the many audiotapes of President
                    Johnson's telephone conversations that are held at the Johnson Library. These
                    audiotapes include substantial numbers of telephone conversations between
                    President Johnson and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                        >Rusk</persName>, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                        >McNamara</persName>, the President's Special Assistant for National
                    Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, and key
                    members of Congress. The editor of this volume selected for publication one
                    audiotape of a President Johnson telephone conversation dealing with Iran. A
                    transcript <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>was then prepared. Although
                    the transcript gives the substance of the conversation, readers are urged to
                    consult the recording for a full appreciation of those dimensions that cannot be
                    captured fully in a transcription, such as the speakers' inflections and
                    emphases that may convey nuances of meaning.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the Johnson Library were
                    the records of the Department of State. The Department's central files contain
                    the cable traffic recording U.S. diplomatic relations with Iran, memoranda of
                    diplomatic conversations, and memoranda proposing action or providing
                    information. Some important documents are found only in the Department's lot
                    files. The Conference Files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain
                    briefing materials as well as records of conversations. Documentation on
                    initiatives that were not approved is often found only in desk or bureau files.
                    The Rusk Files contain records of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                        >Rusk</persName>'s telephone conversations.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians
                    to high-level intelligence documents from those records in the custody of that
                    Agency and at the Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and
                    facilitated by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
                    Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.
                    Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue
                    to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of identifying the key portions
                    of the intelligence record. This volume includes a limited number of
                    intelligence records. Among the intelligence records reviewed for the volume
                    were files of the Directors of Central Intelligence, especially Richard Helms,
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence reports and summaries, and
                    the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Registry of National Intelligence
                    Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of these records is in process. Many of the records are already
                    available for public review at the National Archives. The declassification
                    review of other records is going forward in accordance with the provisions of
                    Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old, except file
                    series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the President, should be
                    reviewed for declassification by 2000.</p>

                                <hi rend="strong">Central Files.</hi> During 1964–1968 the
                                Department's central files were filed according to a subject-numeric
                                system. The records were divided into broad categories:
                                Administration, Consular, Culture and Information, Economic,
                                Political and Defense, Science, and Social. Within each of these
                                divisions were subcategories. For example, Political and Defense
                                contained four subtopics: CSM (communism), DEF (Defense), INT
                                (intelligence), and POL (politics). The subcategories were divided
                                into numerical subdivisions or, in many cases, country files, with
                                numerical subdivisions. The POL series began with files with
                                numerical subdivisions on international issues, such as issues
                                relating to international rivers, and continued with country files.
                                These files have been transferred to the National Archives and
                                Records Administration at College Park Maryland, Record Group 59. <list>

                    <p>Your Majesty:</p>
                    <p>I am delighted that my friend Sargent Shriver is visiting Iran, and can
                        deliver this personal message to you.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SRSJ1">Shriver</persName> visited Iran January
                            14–20 in the dual capacity of Peace Corps Director and personal emissary
                            of President Johnson. He delivered the President's letter during a
                            personal meeting with the Shah on January 15. (Telegram 648 from Tehran,
                            January 16; Department of State, Central Files, ORG 7 PC)</note> I wish
                        that I could come back to Tehran myself; my heart is warmed even now by
                        memories of the welcome which you, the Empress, and your subjects of high
                        and low estate extended to the Johnsons last year. Unfortunately, the press
                        of work makes it impossible for me to be with you now other than in
                        spirit.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances which elevated me to the awesome responsibility of this
                        office still weigh heavily upon me. I know that you, too, feel deeply the
                        loss. I was helped in the period of immediate shock and sorrow following the
                        tragedy by your kindness in sending Prince Gholam Reza to extend your
                        sympathy and Iran's.</p>
                    <p>Since my own trip to Iran I have followed with great interest the strides
                        Iran is making under your leadership toward a new birth of freedom and
                        justice in your ancient land. In freeing the energies of Iran's peasantry
                        and laborers, as well as the women, you have taken a difficult and
                        courageous step. You have proven your faith and confidence in the Iranian
                        people and your resistance to alien pressures. You will be misunderstood and
                        you will be maligned. That is the price of historical movement—the price of
                        progress. But you will also be admired and loved by your people.<note n="3"

                            deter the Soviets and even Nasser. Every time the Shah said 'more arms,'
                            the President came back with ‘more reform.’ Now we've got the Shah
                            thinking he's a 20th Century reformer (and not doing a bad job of it).

                    <p>I have asked Sargent Shriver to convey to you our deep appreciation for your
                        warm welcome to the 45 Peace Corps Volunteers in your country. <pb n="2"

                        have regarded the Peace Corps as one of the most imaginative instruments

                        the cause of world peace and understanding.</p>
                    <p>Our Volunteers have benefited enormously from their experience in your
                        country. The United States will also benefit as they return, with broader
                        horizons and greater understanding of the world, to take their places in our
                        society. They will add a new dimension to American life. I only hope that,
                        while with you, they have contributed in some small way to the well-being of
                        your people and to their understanding of us.</p>
                    <p>I realize now, even better than I did when last we met, just how heavy is the

                        repeat what I said to your entire nation when I left Iran more than a year
                        ago: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“We of the United States know that a free Iran is vital to freedom
                                everywhere, and that as long as freedom stands, Iran's independence
                                and Iran's control over its own destiny will not be compromised. We
                                shall walk beside you toward the new horizons of human dignity. Let
                                me assure you that as long as you walk this road, you'll never walk
                                alone.”</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Dear Mr. President,</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been recalling with pleasure impressions of your memorable but short
                        visit to Teheran, in the company of Mrs. Johnson and your daughter. It was
                        indeed gratifying to have had the occasion to meet you again personally. For
                        the citizens of our capital it was a rare and cherished opportunity to have
                        a glimpse of a kind-hearted and affable personality of your stature, to show
                        their genuine admiration for you and to extend to you, as you no doubt
                        witnessed, their spontaneous and cordial welcome. Such personal contacts and
                        human relationships make for more sincere cooperation, still better
                        understanding and closer ties of friendship between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Let me express the earnest hope that the United States, under your wise and
                        capable leadership will further succeed in her continued efforts to usher in
                        a new era of peace and prosperity for mankind.</p>
                    <p>I am quite confident, Mr. President, that your wisdom and high statesmanship,
                        as well as your long and intimate association with American politics and
                        extensive knowledge and experience of world affairs, will prove invaluable
                        assets in the successful discharge of the heavy responsibilities of your
                        high office both in the United States and abroad.</p>
                    <p>Since your visit, Mr. President, much has happened in Iran. A comprehensive
                        programme of far-reaching social, political and economic reforms, of which
                        you were then given a brief account, has now been fully implemented. These
                        reforms have transformed completely the entire structure of our society, and
                        placed its foundations firmly upon the enlightened and progressive
                        principles of our time. In their application, varying political slogans
                        which essentially cater for the interests of only a certain class of society
                        played no part. The guiding principle of our national policy is the
                        realization of that which is advantageous to the interests of a free and
                        independent society.</p>
                    <p>That the Iranian people wholeheartedly supported the cause of our
                        revolutionary reforms was amply manifested at the referendum of January
                        1963, and during our recent general elections. I am certain that you are
                        already familiar with these events.</p>
                    <p>Our position today, from the point of view of internal stability, national
                        prestige, and our people's confident hope for a better life has <pb n="4"
                            xml:id="pg_4" facs="0032"/>reached a point where, if no external dangers
                        should threaten us, gives us reason to look to the future with well-founded
                        optimism and confidence.</p>
                    <p>Turning to conditions outside Iran, we are thankful that the firm and
                        far-sighted policy of the United States has led the world to the threshold
                        of a period of relaxation of international tension, and that the Soviet
                        Union seems, for the present at least, to have discarded the use of force as
                        an instrument of her foreign policy. In these circumstances, I believe, Mr.
                        President, co-existence with Russia, in the face of the Chinese peril to
                        universal peace, commends itself as the wisest course to adopt; bearing in
                        mind that until such time that complete and general disarmament with full
                        and precise control becomes a reality, the fundamental question of our time,
                        namely the preservation of peace, remains unsolved. Meanwhile, it is a
                        matter of course that we should be well-disposed to undertake any step or
                        action that would contribute to the realization of this goal, provided, of
                        course, that in so doing we do not compromise our principles.</p>
                    <p>Your illustrious predecessor, in a letter written to me just before his
                        tragic demise, had asked my opinion, in view of our past experiences with
                        the Soviet Union, on the question of the bruited non-aggression treaty
                        between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>You are well aware, Mr. President, that in 1959 we were on the point of
                        signing with the Soviet Union a non-aggression treaty for a period of some
                        30 or even 50 years. Their rather ridiculous initial conditions, however,
                        delayed the negotiations for a few days. In the meantime, we received
                        messages from the Presidents of the United States, Turkey and Pakistan
                        warning us of the dangers of such a step. We were even reminded of the fate
                        of the Baltic States. The reason they advanced was that if any action of
                        this nature were to be taken, it would have to be on behalf of all the
                        countries of the free world; in other words, that such an action would have
                        to be collective, if the free world's united front were to remain
                        intact.</p>
                    <p>This reasoning I found convincing, and I believe that it holds true even
                        today. There can be no objection, in principle, to the conclusion of a
                        non-aggression treaty between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the
                        Warsaw Pact countries; it may even be fruitful; but what, may in that case
                        be asked, will be the impact of such a treaty on the regional member nations
                        of the Central Treaty Organization? Where will American and British
                        obligations to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> stand? Will Russia,
                        then, be allowed to have a free hand to do as she pleases elsewhere? In such
                        a situation—should it arise—it is not unlikely that the countries thus
                        exposed will have to see how best they can arrive at a bilateral agreement
                        with the Soviet Union and that, certainly at a price.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0033"/>
                    <p>It is, therefore, highly advisable that the non-aggression pact between
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact countries—if there
                        is to be one—should cover all member countries of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>, in particular those bordering on the Soviet Union and
                        not to leave them outside the agreement. We have also heard of a proposal
                        that all countries of the world should sign a treaty of non-aggression with
                        each other.</p>
                    <p>There are certain countries in the world, the preservation of whose
                        independence and territorial integrity, because of their characteristic
                        geographic position, does not only constitute a service to those countries
                        alone, but a service also to the stability and peace of an entire area. Iran
                        is an instance of such a country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Brezhnev</persName> paid a visit to Iran about a couple of
                        months ago. In his talks with me he did his best to be friendly and to leave
                        formality aside. So much so, that on the last day of his stay he went as far
                        as confiding to me that, relations between Iran and the Soviet Union having
                        improved considerably, he would permit himself to express Russia's dislike
                        of Iran's participation in military agreements with the West. My immediate
                        reply, of course, was that one did not have to go too far to seek the
                        reasons for the existence of such regional defensive agreements. They would
                        automatically lose their force and validity as soon as the numerous military
                        pacts between countries of the world ceased to exist and the dangers of war
                        and aggression no longer posed a threat to the territorial integrity of
                        smaller nations; and that such an ideal situation could only be brought
                        about when general and complete disarmament with proper controls became a
                        reality.</p>
                    <p>Permit me to say a few words now about developments in some of the countries
                        around Iran. A matter to which I wish, Mr. President, to call your attention
                        is the danger which threatens this area of the world. I refer to the
                        stockpiles of weapons of aggression in the possession of Egypt and the ever
                        increasing delivery of offensive equipment to that country by the Soviet
                        Union, designed to serve, overtly or under cover, as instruments of Egyptian
                        intervention. Yemen, the Morocco-Algeria conflict and the arming of Somalia
                        for expansion are instances in point. Egypt, in fact, has already prepared
                        an “intervention force” of considerable size, equipped with long-range
                        bombers, missiles, heavy troop transport planes, submarines, ships, and
                        torpedo boats armed with missiles, so that if a “change” should happen to
                        occur in any Arab country and President Nasser be asked to “intervene” he
                        would willingly do so and let the world be faced with a fait accompli. I
                        should perhaps add that even Iran does not seem to be too distant for his
                        designs or immune from his subversive activities.</p>
                    <p>It is in consideration of these compelling reasons that the security of the
                        Persian Gulf poses for us a source of constant concern, not only in the
                        interest of our own country, but in the interest of the West as well.
                        Indeed, <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0034"/>the stakes involved are so
                        great that any lack of vigilance on our parts may have disastrous
                        consequences. To this situation, we have endeav-oured to draw the attention
                        of the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>Last year, the Pentagon prepared a Five Year Plan for Iran which was accepted
                        with some reservations and for want of a more satisfactory alternative.<note

                            Iran, accepted by Iran on September 19, 1962, see <ref

                        Plan has already proved inadequate for the requirements of the changing
                        situation in this area. The Iranian Army is capable of serious combat
                        neither in the mountainous regions—for lack of adequate material
                        requirements and logistical support—nor in the plains—for being devoid of
                        the required mobility, and armour for such warfare. Our armoured equipment,
                        the M47 tanks, are of type not in current production whose replacement and
                        spare parts can be found with great difficulty. Now, if such is the
                        condition of our equipment in peace time, it is difficult to imagine how
                        they can be of any serious value at times of emergency. We have no military
                        stockpiles of any kind and no reserves, even of machine guns, automatic
                        rifles and ammunition to meet routine demands. Should unforeseen
                        circumstances require us to put our army in a state of mobilization, we
                        shall hardly be able to place ourselves in a state of readiness for the
                        emergency. All our supplies and equipment have been distributed to provide
                        for the army's current requirements.</p>
                    <p>The responsibilities of the Iranian Air Force, moreover, have never been
                        equal to even the minimum of the Army requirements. Our airfields are
                        limited in number, and where they do exist we are there faced with
                        deficiencies in radar facilities and anti-aircraft protection.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, ships and vessels presently in service with our navy, in number
                        as well as in military value, are hardly adequate to carry out their vital
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>If our armed forces are to function effectively and to perform their alloted
                        duties, and if Iran, a staunch and steadfast ally of the United States, is
                        to play her full part in the changing political climate of the Middle East,
                        then obviously, Mr. President, these shortages have to be met. Otherwise, we
                        must consider as wasted the funds that are presently allocated for
                        maintaining our armed forces.</p>
                    <p>In my correspondence with you, Mr. President, I wish to be perfectly candid
                        in dealing with matters of mutual interest. If the United States is not in a
                        position to meet our clear and urgent military needs in addition to the Five
                        Year Plan, in order to be able to fulfil our duties, I thought that we might
                        advisedly arrange for the purchase of our additional needs, under favourable
                        conditions, from the United States of America or from elsewhere.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0035"/>
                    <p>Of course, the question of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> strategy,
                        American engagements and a great many related topics will form the subject
                        of discussions by our representatives at the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> Ministerial Council. We hope that this forthcoming
                        meeting, due to be held in Washington, will provide a suitable opportunity
                        for clarifying all these points. In the meantime, it would be useful if you
                        should see fit to appoint someone to discuss with me urgent matters of
                        interest to our two countries and to report the result to you.</p>
                    <p>In the field of economic activity, it is a source of satisfaction that our
                        own potentials are so great that if we can devote all our planned resources
                        to the implementation of our Five Year Plan, we can envisage an annual
                        growth of 8 per cent, with every hope of raising considerably the material
                        welfare of our people. We have received a number of proposals for economic
                        assistance from Western and even Eastern European countries as well as from
                        the Soviet Union. Doubtless, we would be more than gratified to have offers
                        of loan from the A.I.D. with their very generous terms, and also from the
                        Export-Import Bank and its subsidiary organizations. We would welcome,
                        further, private American investors who would wish to participate in the
                        development of our economy.</p>
                    <p>To turn once again to the Middle East, the situation in Iraq seems uncertain.
                        With the fall of Kassem's unwholesome regime, we welcomed with relief what
                        we hoped would be closer ties with Iraq, thinking that since the Baathists
                        at once began to purge their country of Communists, we had been rid of a
                        troublesome neighbour. Our optimism was shortlived however, for we soon
                        discovered in Southern Iran centres of Arab espionage, with their covetous
                        eyes on a certain integral part of our country, namely Khuzistan, the main
                        centre of our oil industry.</p>
                    <p>With the overthrow of the Baathist Government in Iraq, this danger seems to
                        have abated. Uncertainty however, still persists. For our information
                        indicates that Marshal Aref himself had been fully aware of the above
                        activities and had given them his full support.</p>
                    <p>I regret to say that already Marshal Aref has shown a tendency to turn
                        towards Egypt. If I lay emphasis on this question and express my concern, it
                        is because we are well aware of the developments in this area and the course
                        they are likely to take.</p>
                    <p>Here, I must state that our attitude towards Iraq has always been a friendly
                        one, and we have always hoped that Iraq will have a strong and stable
                        Government, capable of preserving its independence and of safeguarding its
                        national interests.</p>
                    <p>The Kurdish question is still unsettled. Agents of international communism
                        are making every endeavour to exploit the situation to their own advantage,
                        and Cairo is anxious to play its dubious role in any development in this
                        situation.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0036"/>
                    <p>If negotiations between the Government at Baghdad and the Kurds should fail
                        to reach an understanding, we have reason to expect that the fighting will
                        flare up again in the spring.</p>
                    <p>We have reports to the effect that President Nasser did try, and is still
                        making efforts to “mediate” between the Kurds and the Central Government of
                        Iraq. This, on the surface, sounds quite harmless, even perhaps commendable.
                        However, the contents of one of his messages to the Kurds fully reveals his
                        ill intentions towards Iran. He has said in effect, according to our
                        information, that it was a pity the Kurds were fighting the Arabs. He would
                        have given them full support if their force were directed against Iran.</p>
                    <p>Thus with the situation prevailing in Iraq and with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> adventures in Yemen and elsewhere likely to
                        erupt in other parts of the Middle East as well, my obligations to my
                        country and my people make it incumbent upon me to take all precautions for
                        the safety of the country and of our national interests. We cannot tolerate
                        Egypt's subversive influence at our doorstep; nor fail to regard it
                        seriously. I think, as referred to above, upon the stability of Iran depends
                        the security of the entire Middle East. While we in Iran are seeking to
                        ensure the security and stability of our own country, and that of the
                        Persian Gulf, we are contributing also to the preservation of peace in this
                        entire area—an area in which the United States has vital interests.</p>
                    <p>Happily, on these as on other matters, we have always maintained close and
                        cordial contact, and our views have never been far apart.</p>
                    <p>Again, my best wishes for your happiness and success in the service of the
                        United States of America as well as in the cause of the free world.</p>
                    <p>With high esteem,</p>

                    <p>Bob Macy came back to plan the phase-out of the Iranian program. Though he
                        originally argued we'd have to continue development lending to retain

                        key points in Iranian decision making? What can we use for leverage (What

                    <p>669. The following comments may be helpful in connection with preparation of
                        reply to Shah's letter to President of Jan 7.<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">
                            <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Important to realize that at time of writing letter Shah was not, and is not
                        now, in one of the depressed moods which have in past resulted in excessive
                        insecurity leading to appeals for military assistance. On the contrary, he
                        is self-confident and self-assured. In addition to his continuing desire for
                        military equipment beyond what we are providing him, Shah has what seems to
                        me legitimate concern over what will happen when five-year military
                        agreement comes to an end, particularly with regard to providing for
                        replacement of equipment, such as M–47 tanks, which will become
                        unsupportable toward end of current agreement. In addition, Iran is now
                        having to assume certain military expenses (spare parts, consumable
                        supplies) which were not commitments in the agreement but which the Military
                        Assistance Program had previously covered. Shah's long existing desire for
                        military equipment beyond that provided in the agreement has not [now] been
                        reinforced by marked improvement in Iranian financial position arising from
                        increase in revenues from oil.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Shah's attitude to the agreement itself, there is no doubt in
                        my mind, despite language in his letter to President, that he does not
                        consider that he has abrogated agreement or asked for formal renegotiation
                        of it.</p>
                    <p>We will, of course, wish to stress essential validity of five-year agreement,
                        underline our condition that it adequately provides for defense of Iran,
                        convey our assessment that threat to Iranian security now less, not more,
                        than at time agreement signed, and point out that we are meeting our
                        commitments despite fund stringencies and expect Iran to continue to meet
                        hers. However, Shah's concern for post-agreement military needs is in
                        practical terms by no means premature. I, therefore, think President's
                        response should be positive in sense of expressing our willingness to
                        discuss reasonable on-going program of Iranian acquisition military
                        equipment after expiration of agreement. Appropriate comments regarding
                        possibility of declining US grant assistance or its replacement by military
                        credit could be included as necessary. I would hope that possibility of
                        credit at least could be indicated.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0039"/>
                    <p>Within this framework I could then explore in less formal manner more
                        specifically what Shah has in mind and ascertain possibility of mutually
                        satisfactory solution. I believe that if I am able to discuss problem of
                        future program with him in reasonably frank terms, we will be able to
                        contain within acceptable bounds his desire to purchase additional equipment
                        now and ensure that such purchases are from us and compatible with our
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and advisory program. I could also
                        in this context pointedly remind Shah once again of danger that excessive
                        Iranian purchases of military equipment now could call into question
                        agreement itself and result in sharp reduction in US grant military
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>Reference should also be made to the Indian Ocean Task Group and to <gloss
                            target="#t_DELAWAR1">DELAWAR</gloss> as evidence of US interest and
                        ability to reinforce the security of Iran, and of increasing US capacity to
                        deal with limited war situations.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Shah's request that representative be sent here, we have since
                        confirmed he had in mind military representative and referred to his
                        November conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_AGPD1"
                            >Adams</persName>. This request probably arises from fact <persName
                            corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> and I have held line firmly with
                        regard to additional military equipment and Shah would no doubt like to
                        attempt to influence such a representative in that direction. I would hope
                        that President's reply might make clear that his civilian and military
                        representatives in Iran have his full confidence and are entirely qualified
                        to discuss whatever the Shah may have in mind. To avoid brushing off request
                        and in interest Shah's personal relation with President, reply might note
                        General <persName corresp="#p_AGPD1">Adams</persName> will be coming to Iran
                        in March (we understand this is tentative plan) and this will afford
                        opportunity for him to join <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> and me in discussing military matters related to
                        defense of this region.</p>
                    <p>With regard to international political aspects of Shah's message, <gloss
                            target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> will not require lengthy comments from
                        us, but I put forward following.</p>
                    <p>Unlikelihood of non-aggression treaty should be mentioned as well as fact
                        that such treaty, if it should come to pass, would in no way detract from
                        our <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> commitments. Question about
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s being allowed free hand in
                        non-European areas should be vigorously refuted. Ref to <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s having discarded use of force as
                        instrument of foreign policy could be used to lead to emphasis on need for
                        economic development and social, administrative and political reforms to
                        counter possibility of aggression through subversion, especially in
                        vulnerable areas, which is only weapon available to Arabs at moment and in
                        foreseeable future to cause trouble for Iran in Khuzistan.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the President would presumably refer at some point to the situation
                        in Iran. Need to keep Shah's attention focused on what remains to be done
                        fully as great as requirement to approve his hopeful start. I believe <pb
                            n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>we should avoid leaving impression
                        that we share Shah's view that his “comprehensive program…has now been fully
                        implemented” but rather should indicate we are glad he is aware and actively
                        working on the serious social, economic administrative political problems
                        that beset Iran.</p>

                        <item>Proposed Unofficial Visit by the Shah of Iran, May–June 1964</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The exhibit, “7,000 Years of Iranian Art,” which had a highly successful tour
                        of European capitals last year, is now scheduled for a tour of United States
                        cities, beginning in the spring of 1964. The formal opening of the United
                        States tour will take place at the National Gallery of Art in Washington
                        some time between May 25 and June 6, 1964. We think that the value of this
                        event as a landmark in United States-Iranian cultural relations would be
                        greatly enhanced if the Shah of Iran were invited to open the exhibit. This
                        visit might be combined with a trip to Los Angeles, since we have been
                        informed that the University of California at Los Angeles is considering the
                        possibility of awarding the Shah an honorary degree at the commencement
                        exercises in June.</p>
                    <p>The Shah last visited the United States, in an official capacity, in April
                        1962. An unofficial visit for the purposes mentioned above would be useful
                        in demonstrating to him continuing United States interest in the welfare of
                        his country and approval of his program of social reform.</p>
                    <p>If the proposed unofficial visit is made, we would recommend that you and
                        Mrs. Johnson host an informal luncheon for the Shah (and the <pb n="13"
                            xml:id="pg_13" facs="0041"/>Empress if she accompanies him) and that you
                        also have a private informal talk with the Shah on the same occasion. If it
                        should prove impossible to schedule these events, we would not advise the
                        National Gallery of Art to invite the Shah to open the exhibit and we would
                        discourage the University of California from awarding him an honorary
                        degree.</p>

                            while “Iran is subject to the basic political vulnerabilities of a
                            society in transition,…no clearly identifiable threat to internal
                            security is likely to develop in the near future except in the event of
                            the demise or abdication of the Shah.” The intervening period has been
                            relatively uneventful, and nothing has happened which would cause us to
                            change this basic evaluation. In fact, with the passage of time, the
                            disposition of the important disaffected groups (middle-class
                            dissidents, clergy, tribal elements) to engage in anti-regime adventures
                            has diminished and the Government's control of the country has improved.

                                <item>The most noteworthy internal political development was the
                                    formation of the New Iran Party, based on the

                                    program in the new Parliament. This move is part of an attempt
                                    to marshal public support for the reform program and prepare the
                                    groundwork for the long-planned accession of the Party's leader,

                                <item>The most significant actions in regard to internal security
                                    were the arrest of a retired General for “plotting against the
                                    regime,” and the apprehension of some 40 Arab “subversives” in
                                    Khuzistan. The former appears to have been strictly a
                                    precautionary move, with no apparent evidence of an actual
                                    “plot,” whereas the latter appears to have been a response to
                                    probably exaggerated Israeli “tips” on alleged Iraqi and
                                    Egyptian subversion attempts. (See A–361, p. 2 and A–421, p.

                                <item>In respect to the oil problem, Iran has been successful so far
                                    in forestalling unilateral actions by the Organization of
                                    Petroleum Exporting Countries against the oil companies. But the
                                    issue is not yet settled: Iran faces possible dissension with
                                    its Arab neighbors as well as internal political problems if
                                    forced to make a unilateral settlement with the companies. On
                                    the other hand, if forced to go along with OPEC-voted sanctions,
                                    Iran would face financial problems. (See A–421, p. 5.)</item>

                                    ensure success. Civil service reform is stalled in the

                                    control has not passed the talking stage. Land reform activities
                                    have slowed down considerably, largely because of the
                                    increasingly complex administrative problems being encountered

                    <p>In calm, unemotional tone, Shah went over again his preoccupations about
                        Nasser and his concern for the security of Persian Gulf. I gave him the
                        obvious counter-arguments. He has focused his attention particularly on the
                        prepositioning of military equipment, pointing out the advantages of the
                        area in the mountains behind Bandar Abbas as an ideal location. He stated
                        that with the development of the port, Bandar Abbas could become both a
                        naval and military base, representing a secure position in terms of its
                        distance from the Russian and Iraqi borders and pointing out the relative
                        ease of preventing naval penetration of the Persian Gulf from this strategic
                        point. His attention continues to be focused on the Persian Gulf and a
                        potential Arab threat to Khuzistan. His fears of overt threat from Soviet
                        Union are very much less than in the past.</p>
                    <p>The Shah was critical of some of our policies, especially pursuing the same
                        theme he has followed in the past that we do not treat our friends as well
                        as we treat those who are either our enemies or are not committed to us. At
                        the end of about 10 minutes of this, he turned and smiled and said, “but
                        after all, if it weren't for America, none of us would be here", and then
                        restated that he had taken his position with the US and the West and there
                        was no question of abandoning it. He spoke in highest terms of the
                        President, saying that during the latter's visit<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3"

                        communication with Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>, coupled with admiration
                        and respect for him. He expressed the wish of having further discussions
                        with me after the receipt of the President's reply, preliminary to his
                        conversation with the President in June.</p>
                    <p>As previously reported, there have been rumors current in Tehran that the
                        Shah's health has deteriorated. He told me that basically his condition had
                        not changed but that the doctor in Vienna had counselled more frequent and
                        longer periods of rest away from his heavy responsibilities. He does bear a
                        heavy burden, works long hours, and is by nature a worrier. He appears to me
                        to be unchanged from when I last saw him prior to his visit to Europe.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you for your long letter of January 7, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">
                            <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> and for the frank comments
                        which it contains. It is just this sort of mutual candor which you and I
                        must always strive to maintain.</p>
                    <p>Sargent Shriver has told me of the warm hospitality which you extended to
                        him. We are all proud of the similarity between our Peace Corps and your
                        Literacy Corps and recently established Health Corps. Indeed, your whole
                        program of social reform is highly regarded here. Iran seems the brightest
                        spot in the Middle East these days. On all those fronts of greatest concern
                        to Iran—the threat from the north, internal security, and the modernization
                        of Iranian society—the outlook seems most favorable.</p>
                    <p>The important thing now is to press forward and consolidate the domestic
                        progress so well begun. I am impressed with the support you are giving to
                        civil service, budget, and fiscal reform. Let me urge on you the equal
                        importance of a dynamic and buoyant economy; as you know, I too am devoting
                        much attention to this problem in the United States. We wish all success to
                        your new government, which seems to us to be going in the right
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>Because of Iran's exposed position, we have always taken quite seriously your
                        military concerns. However, after another thorough look, we have concluded
                        that the basic factors that led our military experts to agree on the current
                        Five-Year Military Plan have not changed significantly. I personally believe
                        the Plan remains practical and adequate. While we can understand your quite
                        natural worry about potential developments in the Arab world, we simply do
                        not yet foresee much likelihood of a substantial Arab threat to Iran. I can
                        assure you, however, that should any such threat develop, we are more than
                        prepared to re-examine the situation with you. Meanwhile, we trust that Iran
                        will continue to do its best to live up to its very difficult tasks under
                        the Five-year Plan.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_AGPD1">Adams</persName> will be coming to Iran
                        again in late March or early April, and if you desire he could discuss with
                        you some of the very broad questions you have raised in your letter. Of
                        course, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> also stand ready to
                        discuss at any time the full range of your political and military
                        problems.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"/>
                    <p>I much appreciate your comments on the meaning of a possible non-aggression
                        pact between Communist and non-Communist states. They strike a responsive
                        chord, and I can assure you that no East-West pact of this kind is
                        contemplated at present. If such a matter were ever to be seriously
                        considered, I would expect to consult fully with you before any final
                        decisions were made.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile I very much look forward to seeing you in June when we can discuss
                        these matters further. Personal discussions between the leaders of our two
                        Governments are important to both our countries, and it will be a pleasure
                        to have you here in Washington again.</p>

                    <p>On March 18 we in <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> were surprised to learn
                        for the first time that Iran is one of the fourteen countries described in
                        the President's foreign aid address of March 19 to Congress<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d9fn2">For text of the President's foreign aid message to
                            Congress on March 19, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                        aid to self-support. Before Iran's inclusion in this group of countries, it
                        had been our understanding that the contemplated transition period was one
                        or two years, and we were thus most concerned that a decision seemed to have
                        been taken without our concurrence to end aid to Iran within so brief a
                        time. We informed A.I.D. of our concern.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0050"/>
                    <p>We now concur in Iran's inclusion on the list of transition countries, having
                        been assured (1) that the list is not limited to countries to which we plan
                        to end our aid within a year or two and (2) that there has been no change
                        from the position agreed upon in the Country Assistance Strategy Statement
                        for Iran signed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> on
                        December 30, 1963. This statement calls for continuation of Development
                        Loans to Iran through June 1965, after which the further continuation or
                        termination of concessional rate lending will depend upon economic trends in
                        Iran and the availability of U.S. funds. As for technical assistance through
                        Development Grants, our aim is described as termination of this program in
                        four or five years “if, as anticipated, Iran succeeds in obtaining
                        assistance it needs through the international agencies and if our technical
                        assistance activities are successful in building up the competence of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to manage its development drive more
                        efficiently.”</p>
                    <p>We agree, and we are pleased, that Iran does in fact appear now to be in
                        stage of transition which it may be hoped will lead, if present trends
                        continue, to eventual self-reliance. However, we believe it would be a very
                        serious mistake to withdraw our aid presence abruptly from Iran, the most
                        vulnerable country on the Soviet perimeter and the key member of <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. The progress of the past eighteen
                        months should not hide the fact that Iran is still a weak country
                        periodically in need of reassurance. It would be short-sighted, possibly
                        tragically so, to become committed too far in advance and without adequate
                        study to a position which would deprive us of an important means of
                        providing such reassurance. Moreover, our assistance strategy should not
                        ignore the fact that strategically located Iran still remains hospitable to
                        our military and intelligence sites at a time when other countries are
                        obliging us to remove or limit such facilities.</p>

                        Five-Year Military Assistance Program. He went into considerable detail
                        explaining the ever increasing Arab threat and used this as a basis for
                        requiring more and better military equipment. He suggested that the
                        President appoint someone to discuss with him urgent matters of interest to
                        Iran and the United States.</p>

                        indicated that the basic factors that led to the Five-Year Military Plan
                        have not significantly changed and that we have not seen any major change in
                        the Arab situation.</p>
                    <p>The President informed the Shah that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"

                            Despite shortages of funds and pressing needs from areas such as
                            Vietnam, U.S. has managed to continue essential elements of the

                            terminates. If there is one, and if adequate funds are appropriated,
                            U.S. would hope to continue its relationship of military cooperation
                            with Iran. In view of Iran's rapidly improving financial condition, it
                            will probably be necessary for the U.S.G.-financed grant <gloss

                            for only a portion of the total, and for Iran to cover the remainder
                            with its own foreign exchange resources. The proportion of <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> grant to the total would probably have
                            to be reduced year by year. US materiel would be available for sale to
                            Iran under this program. Depending on Iran's overall financial condition
                            and on other demands on Iran's foreign exchange, credit terms for such
                            sales might be available. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In your

                                            out of date. The Shah agreed that perhaps it would only
                                            be necessary to replace the M–47 with the M–60 in 2

                            target="#t_DELAWAR1">DELAWAR</gloss> I had two hour after dinner
                        conversation alone with Shah.</p>
                    <p>He went over his discussion with General <persName corresp="#p_AGPD1"
                            >Adams</persName> of April 5 and then referred to statement in
                        President's letter of March 19 that future military programs could be
                        discussed with me. He then outlined his concept of modernization of Iranian
                        armed forces, giving the same reasons for the need of improvement as he has
                        expounded previously, although there was less note of urgency than he had
                        previously expressed. Although Shah did not say it in so many words, I had
                        the feeling that he has to some degree, at least, come to recognize that
                        possibility of aggression in Persian Gulf area or against Khuzistan is less
                        immediate than he had previously maintained. This does not mean that he has
                        changed his view about Arab ambitions but he seems now to feel that he has
                        more time to prepare himself for defense against it. Criticism of our policy
                        toward Nasser was totally absent.</p>
                    <p>Shah then gave me a series of papers which set forth existing equipment
                        shortages and additional equipment which he desires, some of it on a
                        relatively short term basis and some having to do with long term replacement
                        of items which will become unsupportable, such as tanks and <pb n="30"
                            xml:id="pg_30" facs="0058"/>F–86 aircraft. On question of aircraft
                        replacement, Shah volunteered statement that he realized perfectly well that
                        it would be some time before Iranian air force could absorb and efficiently
                        operate and maintain any additional aircraft beyond F5As. He added, however,
                        that every effort should be made to improve and expand Iranian capabilities
                        in this connection.</p>
                    <p>Shah said that he realized the difficulties of our position in furnishing
                        equipment on a grant basis over and above that envisaged in five year
                        program. He pointed out the improvement in Iran's revenues and foreign
                        exchange position and said that what he wanted was to work out a
                        modernization program which would not be extravagant and which would not
                        hamper Iran's economic development program; this should be done without
                        reference to whether the equipment would be furnished by grant from the US
                        or by purchase from Iranian funds. He hoped that purchases could be arranged
                        on an installment basis. I replied that US could make no commitment for the
                        furnishing of military equipment on a grant basis beyond that envisaged in
                        the five year plan. I then described to him the difficulty of sales of
                        military equipment on credit because under our system there were no public
                        funds available from which such sales could be financed, reminding him that
                        the manufacturer in every case had to be paid in cash. Shah then wondered
                        whether or not credit terms could be arranged with American manufacturers. I
                        replied that this might be looked into at some subsequent time.</p>
                    <p>The series of papers which Shah handed me were part in Persian and part in
                        English and constitute only a list [of] Iranian views of requirements. There
                        is one document in Persian, not yet translated, which apparently contains
                        some rationale with respect to these requirements. Shah admitted that these
                        papers did not constitute a comprehensive approach to the problem,
                        particularly as no attempt at phasing had been made. He made one or two oral
                        statements with respect to time factors which will be reported when we have
                        had a chance to study the character and magnitude of equipment requirements
                        set forth.</p>
                    <p>I told the Shah that I would ask the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                        staff to examine the various lists which he had sent me and that after a
                        clearer picture of magnitude, phasing, etc., emerged, discussions might be
                        held with Iranian staff. The Shah readily agreed to this and said that he
                        was sorry the presentation had not been more orderly, expressing the hope
                        that the work could begin without delay as he wished to make as much
                        progress as possible before his visit to Washington in June.</p>
                    <p>I am refraining from any substantive comment on the Shah's proposals until we
                        are able to examine them here, including getting some idea of cost.</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0059"/>
                    <p>In light of Shah's proposal that a modernization program be discussed without
                        reference to which party should bear costs, I should appreciate confirmation
                        my authority to proceed.</p>

                        <item>We share Shah's hope that material he presented will permit sufficient
                            early discussion with Iranian staff so that general outlines of feasible

                            except possibly as regards sales of U.S. equipment for short-term
                            expansion and replacement programs mentioned in third para

                        in office has rightly concentrated on economic matters, one major political
                        problem that has arisen to plague him and Shah is how to deal with the
                        recently released <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Ayatollah Khomeini</persName>.
                        As we see it, following factors bear on situation.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Although idea of releasing <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                                >Khomeini</persName> prior to Moharam period originated with
                            previous govt and although ultimate decision was made by Shah, it was
                                <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> and Pakravan who seem
                            to have precipitated the problem by urging the Shah to let <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> go. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> thus has certain responsibility
                            for outcome.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s latest activities and
                            notably his speech of April 15 (reported NIT–6441) place govt in
                            dilemma. If he is permitted to go on agitating, this will involve loss
                            of prestige to regime and can snowball into serious trouble; but if he
                            is re-arrested, especially during sensitive period just before and
                            during Moharam, this could also cause serious trouble.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>There is little reason to doubt that regime is able to control or, if
                            necessary, beat down any manifestations during Moharam period, starting
                            evening May 12. Determination shown by regime during Moharam riots last
                            year is in itself an important factor discouraging repetition of
                            disorders.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>One of most interesting features of <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                                >Khomeini</persName>'s statements is his appeal for constitutional
                            govt, which intrigues National Front which otherwise has little reason
                            to sympathize with Mullahs. Speech also attacked arms expenditures,
                            relations with Israel, featured xenophobic themes (including claim that
                            govt is “giving away our resources to foreigners”) and by implication
                            attacked the Shah himself and the entire reform program. We understand
                            tapes of April 15 speech are circulating in Tehran opposition circles
                            and National Front elements are now considering cooperating with
                            Mullahs.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Although there are signs that economy is picking up, the social
                            background of urban unemployment and misery, especially in Tehran's
                            south side, is essentially unchanged from last year. In bazaar,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> has continued to
                            have many sympathizers, and as far as we can tell his prestige has, if
                            anything, increased in that quarter since his release.</item>
                        <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0062"/>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Govt is playing this very carefully so far. Warnings have been sent to
                            Khomeini, and we have no information of political statements by him
                            since April 5 although he made it clear on that occasion that he intends
                            to ignore the warnings. April 23, religious holiday, saw usual large
                            crowds in Qom (estimated by one source at 50,000) and substantial
                            numbers came to “Kisyrand,” but it is possible that Khomeini has
                            subsided at least for a while. We understand, however, that recording of
                            his April 15 speech was played at Qom mosque on April 24.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Our tentative conclusion is that, if Khomeini persists, Shah is most likely
                        to order his re-arrest prior to Moharam; that govt is capable of controlling
                        or countering any possible demonstrations stirred up by Khomeini (or his
                        arrest); but that showdown may be postponed until after the holiday period.
                        Will submit another estimate as we come closer to Moharam.</p>

                        or study equipment list which he had handed me in reftel. He <pb n="35"
                            xml:id="pg_35" facs="0063"/>immediately disassociated himself from any
                        desire for a full-scale armored division of the usual type in Khuzistan and
                        indicated that he had no plans for an additional armored brigade and an
                        additional infantry brigade in the area. This will make a substantial
                        difference in cost in money and personnel which the first analysis of the
                        papers handed to me in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> revealed.
                        The paper which ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is to present
                        and discuss with Iranian staff is being revised accordingly. Copies of this
                        revision will be sent to <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>
                        and to Department.</p>
                    <p>He again forcefully stated his determination to build a force capable of
                        defending Khuzistan against any local threat or of stemming a major threat
                        until assistance could be forthcoming. His concept is to convert the eighth
                        division into a unit of three battalions of tanks, three battalions of
                        armored infantry with armored personnel carriers, an armored cavalry unit
                        and normal artillery plus one battery of eight-inch howitzers.</p>
                    <p>Shah also alluded to need for airlift for two parachute battalions to provide
                        for rapid reinforcement of area. In process of stressing urgency of his
                        desire for more tanks, he emphasized his need to know availability date of
                        M–60 tanks and price and approximate date of availability of projected
                        Sheridan tank equipped with Shillelagh missile (ARMISH/<gloss
                            target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is seeking this information through
                            <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>Shah made great point of vital importance of Khuzistan to Iran emphasizing
                        that this province contains Iran's huge oil reserves and refineries and that
                        other developments, including Dez Dam with electric power, will make
                        Khuzistan thriving industrial region of future. He expressed determination
                        to see that there would be sufficient defensive power on ground to preserve
                        this vital area for Iran. He conceded that he could not describe the
                        immediate military threat but was persuaded that if proper defensive measure
                        is not taken that threat would develop within two years' time.</p>
                    <p>Shah is very optimistic about increase in oil revenue. Iran's decision to
                        accept consortium's recent offer will, in his opinion, result in revenues
                        this year amounting to 500 million dollars. Discovery of additional large
                        oil reserve makes it certain that Iran will be able to increase its
                        production consistently over foreseeable future. Shah believes that with
                        completion of pipe line and products terminal at Bandar Ma'shur, the cost of
                        production per barrel will be reduced from 26 cents to 32 cents and pointed
                        out that half of this savings will redound to Iran's revenues. He expressed
                        confidence that by 1970 oil royalties from consortium and from other
                        sources, such as PanAm, will amount to a billion 200 million dollars and a
                        modest portion of this income can appropriately be devoted to defense of
                        area whence it comes. He readily agreed that these military expenditures
                        should not be greater than required for a safe minimum defense and felt that
                        this could be achieved without impairing economic development <pb n="36"
                            xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>in light of very substantial anticipated
                        increased revenue from oil.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing will probably be the basis of what the Shah will have to say to
                        the President on June 5. He asked how far he should go in discussing these
                        matters with the President and I replied by saying that only one period of
                        probably an hour's duration had been arranged for conversation with
                        President and that there would certainly be no opportunity for
                        “negotiations.” I felt certain the President would be glad to hear of his
                        preoccupations but I felt that the discussions would be in general terms
                        over a broad range of subjects of mutual interest to Iran and the US. I
                        reminded the Shah of the brief and informal character of his visit and that
                        the meeting with the President had developed only incidentally after his
                        acceptance of the invitation to open the art exhibition and to speak at
                            <gloss target="#t_UCLA1">UCLA</gloss>. The Shah seemed to accept this as
                        reasonable. I took this opportunity of telling him that the Department had
                        not felt it necessary for me to be in Washington at the time of his
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>I shall expect to discuss military requirements with the Shah at greater
                        length before his departure for the US and hope to be able later to report
                        more specifically on his position.</p>

                            understand an effort to dissuade him from coming to Los Angeles in the
                            absence of documented and reasoned cause. He pointed out that an April
                            27 letter from President Kerr had expressed the hope that a small but
                            vocal group of dissident students would not deter the Shah from coming
                            to California. Thus, if the situation had changed since April 27, this

                    </p>
                    <p>Our relations with the Shah, and hence our national security interests, have
                        been seriously endangered by increasing activity on the part of <pb n="38"
                            xml:id="pg_38" facs="0066"/>anti-Shah Iranians in the United States,
                        which may culminate in humiliating and perhaps dangerous demonstrations at
                        the <gloss target="#t_UCLA1">UCLA</gloss> Commencement in June. The effect
                        of these activities is magnified by Iranian suspicion that the anti-Shah
                        Iranians in the United States are being covertly condoned or even supported
                        by the United States Government. We therefore request that you approach the
                        Attorney General, apprise him of the gravity of the situation, and ask him
                        to take deportation action against an anti-Shah leader in the United States,
                        thus restoring Iranian confidence in United States intentions and,
                        hopefully, dampening the ardor of other agitators.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">

                    </p>
                    <p>For the past six years the activities of anti-Shah Iranians in the United
                        States have been a source of serious friction between the United States and
                        Iran. Anti-American and sycophantic elements in the Imperial Court have
                        fanned the Shah's suspicions that important elements in the United States
                        Government are secretly backing these bitterly anti-Shah Iranians, and that
                        their propaganda activities, including demonstrations against the Shah and
                        members of the royal family on visits to the United States, are condoned by
                        the United States. Unfavorable comparisons are drawn with the actions of
                        other governments, such as that of France, which locked up anti-Shah
                        Iranians during the period of the Shah's visit to France.</p>
                    <p>The Iranian tendency to suspect the United States Government of involvement
                        in these activities is compounded by such factors as the following: (a)
                        personal friendships between anti-Shah leaders and prominent Americans, such
                        as Justice Douglas; (b) reception by the Attorney General of a delegation of
                        anti-Shah Iranians and his subsequent cancellation of a stop in Tehran on
                        his first trip to the Far East; and (c) suspension by the Department of
                        Justice of deportation proceedings against anti-Shah Iranians in the United
                        States whose passports had expired and were deemed not renewable by the
                        Iranian Government. In two of the latter cases, suspension was continued
                        even after our Ambassador had, at the request of the Department of Justice,
                        obtained the Shah's personal assurance that he would not prosecute the two
                        if they returned.</p>
                    <p>One of the Shah's top security advisors, who was in the United States a few
                        weeks ago, stated that while the Shah would continue to be annoyed over
                        demonstrations and other anti-regime activities, the real danger to United
                        States-Iran relations was the Shah's growing suspicion that unfriendly
                        elements in the United States were being protected by the United States
                        Government. He begged us to take some symbolic action which would counteract
                        these suspicions.</p>
                    <p>This problem has been exacerbated by recent information, unconfirmed at
                        present, indicating that anti-regime leaders will mount a very large
                        demonstration against the Shah at <gloss target="#t_UCLA1">UCLA</gloss> in
                        the course of the Shah's <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>June visit.
                        We may have to choose between the grave dangers of suggesting that the Shah
                        cancel his appearance in Los Angeles or risking serious humiliation and
                        possible danger to the Shah.</p>
                    <p>In either case, the possibility of a serious break with the Shah could be
                        greatly reduced by some action which would convince His Majesty that we are
                        not condoning the activities of these elements. Such an action might well
                        also dampen the enthusiasm of other anti-regime Iranians, particularly those
                        without valid passports, and reduce the intensity of such demonstrations as
                        may be held.</p>

                        he had never been a member of a communist organization, would appear to be
                        perfectly tailored for the present situation. There is no basis for pity for
                        Shayegan. He informed an <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> officer
                        personally less than a year ago that he intended to dedicate the remainder
                        of his life to the destruction of the Shah. You may remember him as being
                        the most fanatical and anti-Western member of Mosadeq's last cabinet, except
                        for Foreign Minister Fatemi, who was executed.</p>

                        <item>It remains uncertain whether modernization in Iran will proceed
                            relatively peacefully or whether violence and revolution are in store.
                            The Shah's reform effort has already helped to stimulate and shape the
                            forces which must eventually, in one way or another, bring basic changes
                            to Iranian society. Already the strength of the landlord class has been
                            somewhat impaired, the gratitude of the peasants has been enlisted and
                            their expectations aroused, and a new and growing managerial class seems
                            to be acquiring increased responsibilities. However, the Shah, supported
                            by the armed forces, still dominates Iranian political life and seems
                            likely to do so for some time to come. With the self-confidence he has
                            acquired from the relative success of his reform measures thus far, he
                            will probably continue to move forward, though with occasional pauses,
                            like the present one in his land reform program. (Paras. 5, 9,
                            26–27)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Iran is emerging only slowly from a recession which began in 1961 as
                            the result of ineptly applied anti-inflationary measures and the
                            consequent loss of business confidence. The latter was further set back
                            by the uncertainties engendered by the reform measures. But the
                            resources of the country are adequate to sustain a vigorous economic
                            development, and the outlook for ample and growing oil revenues is
                            promising. Within the next few years, Iran will probably be able to
                            overcome the current slowdown and return to a fairly rapid rate of
                            growth. (Paras. 15–16, 18)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The reduction in tensions which followed normalization of relations
                            with the Soviet Union in September 1962 has continued, but relations are
                            not likely to become significantly more intimate over the next few
                            years. Though the Shah sees a need to appear more independent of the US,
                            the outlook is for satisfactory US-Iranian relations for at least a
                            considerable time to come. Iran is less dependent than in the past on US
                            economic aid, but in the military and security field continues to rely
                            on US assistance. (Paras. 31–35)</item>

                        <hi rend="italic">I. Iran's Problems</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. In many respects Iran resembles other backward states ruled by traditional
                        elites and confronted by the many pressures for radical change generated
                        through wider contact with the modern world. There has been a continuing
                        possibility that sooner or later the entire structure of the government and
                        the society would either have to revolutionize itself or be overturned by
                        self-appointed revolutionaries. At one point Mossadeq seemed on the verge of
                        accomplishing such a revolution. Yet his regime collapsed, and the
                        post-Mossadeq era has not seen a resurgence of revolutionary forces. Change
                        has come, but it has been neither radical nor cataclysmic. The social and
                        governmental institutions have been stretched but not rent asunder.</p>
                    <p>2. The explanation seems to rest in large part with the character of the Shah
                        and the kind of role he has come to play, not only as a symbol but as an
                        active national leader. He has long been aware of the pressures for change
                        and has at various times taken a number of steps toward reform, though none
                        was vigorously pressed. He eventually came to the view that such a slow pace
                        of reform—as exemplified by distribution of crown land to peasants—would not
                        be sufficient to maintain the regime over the long run. By the late 1950's
                        agitation for reform seemed to be evoking a growing popular response; the
                        country was beset with major economic difficulties; and the Shah was
                        vulnerable to charges of reaction which not only offered his external
                        enemies wide scope for attack but also distressed his foreign friends and
                        supporters. In this setting, the government's rigging of the 1961 elections
                        again returned a parliament (Majlis) composed of the traditional elite and
                        created a dangerous situation. In May 1961 the Shah felt it necessary to
                        bring in Prime Minister Amini with a broad mandate for change. Amini's
                        reform measures provided some temporary relief, but they began to alienate
                        the conservative elite without attracting any support from the National
                        Front opposition.</p>
                    <p>3. Recognizing that Amini's measures were not alleviating opposition to the
                        regime, the Shah allowed his government to fall in July 1962. At this
                        juncture, the Shah evidently came to the conclusion that he must himself
                        take responsibility for a more basic attack on Iran's problems. If this
                        meant radical changes, he was prepared to make them. He also hoped by such
                        measures to take the wind out of the opposition's sails and to broaden his
                        own base of political support. To this end he proposed a six-point program,
                        which was approved in a referendum in January 1963. Land reform, toward
                        which some steps had been taken by the Amini <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43"
                            facs="0071"/>government, was the main plank in this program and rapidly
                        became the focus of popular attention.<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">The
                            six-point program also included profit sharing for workers, eradication
                            of illiteracy, electoral reform, nationalization of forests, and the
                            sale of government enterprises. The granting of suffrage to women,
                            though not specifically one of the six points, was widely heralded as an
                            essential part of the Shah's reform program. [Footnote in the source

                    </p>
                    <p>4. Under the management of the dynamic and ambitious Minister of Agriculture,
                        Arsanjani, the land reform program initially moved very rapidly. But, when
                        Arsanjani seemed to be pressing the land reform too rapidly and to be using
                        it to establish an independent political position, the Shah forced him to
                        resign. Thereafter the pace of land reform was slowed considerably. The
                        government found it difficult to provide agricultural credits and the
                        trained managers for rural cooperatives both of which were necessary for the
                        success of the program. In September 1963, the government publicly claimed
                        that the first phase of the program—expropriation of the largest
                        landholdings—had been completed.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">Of the
                            approximately 50,000 villages in Iran, about 10,000 were owned by large
                            landowners—those who owned more than one village. By 23 September 1963
                            all or parts of more than 8,000 of these villages had been purchased by
                            the government at a cost of $62.2 million. Legal complications had
                            delayed the takeover of the remaining 2,000 villages in this category.
                            Of the villages acquired by the government, about 6,400 had been
                            distributed to 271,000 families, comprising roughly ten percent of the
                            agricultural population. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Some
                        preparatory work is now going on for the second phase of the reform program,
                        which is to involve roughly 25,000 of the villages held by one or more
                        landlords, but it is not clear whether or when a decision to proceed with it
                        will be made.</p>
                    <p>5. The reform program has not yet brought about a basic change in Iranian
                        society or reduced the Shah's domination of political life. However, the
                        Shah may have set in train a process of change which could have far-reaching
                        consequences. Already the strength of the landlord class has been somewhat
                        impaired, the gratitude of the peasants has been enlisted and their
                        expectations aroused, and a new and growing managerial class seems to be
                        acquiring increased responsibilities. Nevertheless, the Shah's regime
                        continues to depend essentially on the army and security forces which have
                        received important favors in return for their loyalty. Much of the urban
                        middle class remains disaffected. The “Thousand Families,” though deprived
                        of much of their land, are still wealthy, and many remain entrenched in the
                        Shah's entourage. Finally, the peasantry is not organized and has
                        demonstrated little political consciousness.</p>
                    <p>6. One aspect of social change in Iran which holds considerable significance
                        for the future has been the rise of the technically trained managerial and
                        administrative class who now have reached the upper levels of the
                        bureaucracy in substantial numbers. This new breed of foreign-educated
                        intellectual first became prominent in the late 1950's in the Plan <pb
                            n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0072"/>Organization which, being independent
                        of the traditional bureaucracy, provided quick advancement. They are now
                        gradually being distributed throughout the bureaucracy. While many are not
                        enthusiastic about the Shah's style of government, they are sympathetic with
                        much of his reform program and are helping to implement it.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">II. Political Situation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. Despite the Shah's authoritarian rule, he has generally felt the need for
                        a facade of representative government. In September 1963, after two years of
                        ruling without parliament, he again held elections. Like their predecessors,
                        these elections were rigged; the contending political parties were again
                        cliques attached to certain personalities and not representative of broader
                        population groups. But this time the elections were used by the Shah
                        significantly to increase the number of government officials—including many
                        associated with the land reform program—in the Majlis and to greatly reduce
                        the representatives of the landlord class.</p>
                    <p>8. In constituting his most recent cabinet, that of <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHA1">Hasan Ali Mansur</persName> in March 1964, the Shah
                        once again turned to the managerial and administrative class. Although
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>'s experience in government
                        affairs is limited, he has a reputation for being a capable administrator.
                        In 1959 he became head of the Progressive Center, a group of pro-government
                        technicians, businessmen, and intellectuals which formed the nucleus of the
                        New Iran Party, founded at the Shah's behest in 1963. Though this party now
                        has about 140 of the 189 deputies in the Majlis, it is an artificial
                        creation without a popular base.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The Role of the Military</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>9. Although the reform program in theory threatens the senior officers who
                        have a vested interest in the status quo, thus far they do not seem to have
                        suffered or to be particularly concerned. Some of the middle-grade and
                        junior officers probably share the outlook of the nationalist opposition,
                        but the government is constantly screening the officer corps, and dissent
                        within the military does not appear to be growing. We believe that the
                        overwhelming majority of the officer corps are loyal to the Shah.</p>
                    <p>10. The Shah continues to rely on the National Intelligence and Security
                        Organization (<gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>) not only to design
                        strategy for neutralizing the opposition but to organize political support
                        for the government as well. <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> has not,
                        however, been able to forestall periodic outbursts of open defiance of the
                        government. On occasion the police and gendarmery have not been able to
                        handle civil disturbances, and have had to call in the military. In these
                        actions, the armed forces have generally performed creditably, and we
                        believe that they can successfully cope with any likely disorders.</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0073"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Opposition</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>11. The opposition has been seriously disorganized and weakened by the Shah's
                        tactics. The leaders of the loosely organized National Front (the remnants
                        of ex-Prime Minister Mossadeq's organization) have been unwilling to support
                        the reform program, since their real objective is not so much benefits for
                        the population at large as it is power for themselves. Yet when they have
                        combined with the conservatives to criticize the Shah's program, they have
                        forfeited popular support. The government has been alert to exploit this
                        dilemma. Moreover, by keeping many of the National Front leaders in
                        detention until just before the elections, the government effectively
                        stifled their chances. As a result of these vicissitudes, the party's
                        political chief has resigned and it is in serious disarray. The danger that
                        extreme and irresponsible elements will gain control is growing.</p>
                    <p>12. The conservative forces, which until recently supported the Shah, are now
                        largely disaffected. The religious hierarchy in particular sees the reform
                        program as striking at its power and interests. The mullahs have taken the
                        lead and played a major role in agitation against the government which led
                        to widespread popular demonstrations in June 1963. The government's vigorous
                        suppression of these demonstrations and its continuing strong pressure
                        against religious dissidents has severely weakened this segment of the
                        opposition. Furthermore, the mullahs have for some time been hampered by
                        their inability to agree on an overall leader, and their disunity and
                        confusion have been compounded by the government's tactics of alternately
                        arresting and releasing the leading religious figures. While some of the
                        larger landlords have accommodated to the reform program, many of them
                        remain apprehensive and a source of opposition to further development of the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>13. The Tudeh (Communist) Party has been effectively suppressed. Its main
                        leadership is either in exile or in jail. The party has not made appreciable
                        headway in Iran in recent years and is heavily penetrated by the security
                        forces. Although the discord within the National Front may provide the Tudeh
                        with increased opportunities for infiltration, it appears now to have little
                        chance of coming to dominate the movement.</p>
                    <p>14. Tribal dissidence remains a potential rather than a present threat to the
                        regime. The Iranian Kurds have yet to overcome their traditional tribal
                        rivalries and lack any widely accepted local leader. Moreover, they have no
                        very serious grievance, and the government is taking some steps to extend to
                        the Kurdish areas the benefits of economic development and to integrate them
                        in greater degree into national life. The Iranian Kurds are unlikely to
                        create serious problems for the government unless Iraqi Kurds win a large
                        measure of autonomy or unless the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        makes a determined attempt to incite a separatist movement. Neither of these
                        developments now seems likely. While tribal disorders may occur in other <pb
                            n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0074"/>parts of Iran, such conflicts are
                        easy to contain and isolate, and it would be extremely difficult for the
                        diverse tribal groupings to coordinate action against the regime. Though
                        there is almost certainly some Egyptian or Iraqi intrigue among the
                        Khuzistan Arabs, they are unarmed, sunk in poverty and apathy, and therefore
                        constitute no threat at present.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">III. Economic Trends</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>15. Iran's natural resources are capable of supporting extensive economic
                        development. Arable land is more than adequate to support the growing
                        population, and irrigation projects are increasing agricultural productivity
                        and bringing new land under cultivation. Favored by good weather, total
                        agricultural production in 1963 increased some nine percent over that of the
                        previous year. Iran's most important asset, however, is its booming oil
                        industry, which is largely insulated from the vagaries of Iran's domestic
                        economy. The government's rapidly rising revenues from this source are
                        sufficient to provide a solid base for a broad development program, even
                        allowing for continued mismanagement and corruption.</p>
                    <p>16. Since 1961 Iran has been plagued by a recession which has resulted in
                        considerable unemployment, unused productive capacity, and an unfavorable
                        climate for investment. For a number of years prior to 1961, rising oil
                        revenues, large foreign loans, and good harvests stimulated a high rate of
                        economic activity. Gross National Product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss>) was rising by nearly six percent annually, and by 1961
                        annual investment had risen to about 18 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss>. The number of banks and factories doubled, and a start was
                        made toward modernizing the government's economic institutions and
                        practices. By 1960, however, the attempt to carry out such an ambitious—and
                        largely uncoordinated—effort led to serious inflationary pressures, a
                        speculative construction boom, and a sharp decline in foreign exchange
                        reserves. This obliged the government to replace its expansionary policies
                        with a series of anti-inflationary measures, which frightened the business
                        community and proved to be more difficult to rescind than to impose.</p>
                    <p>17. More recently, the government has been seeking to revive the domestic
                        economy through attempts to increase expenditures under the Third Plan
                        (1962–1968), stimulate private industry, and expand exports. Credit has been
                        made cheaper and more readily available and a trade agreement has been
                        concluded with the Common Market. However, the expansionary effect of such
                        policies has been small, due at least in part to the political uncertainties
                        engendered by the Shah's simultaneous effort to launch his reform
                        program.</p>
                    <p>18. The advent of the <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>
                        government and the slowing of the reform program have apparently begun to
                        restore business confidence. Although administrative difficulties continue
                        to prevent the government from rapidly increasing public investment under
                        the Plan, a modest rise <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0075"/>has been
                        achieved in recent months. Nevertheless, many problems remain, and we do not
                        foresee a strong business recovery in the immediate future. Iran's
                        underlying economic strength, however, will probably enable it to overcome
                        these difficulties and within the next few years return to a more rapid rate
                        of growth.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Oil</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>19. One of the basic reasons for Iran's favorable prospects is its booming
                        oil industry, which provided the government with about $380 million in
                        revenues in 1963, an amount likely to increase by at least 8 to 10 percent
                        annually for the next several years. Since the disastrous experience with
                        nationalizing the oil industry during the Mossadeq era, the Iranian
                        Government has dealt with the oil consortium through negotiations rather
                        than threats. Though the government periodically voices complaints against
                        the consortium's exploration and development programs, the rapid rise of oil
                        production and revenues in Iran and the development of several new deposits
                        have largely allayed these criticisms. Iran will doubtless desire greater
                        oil revenues than in fact it receives, but it will probably continue to take
                        a more realistic attitude than the more extreme members of the Organization
                        of Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1"

                    </p>
                    <p>20. The concept of comprehensive economic development planning has not yet
                        gained a firm foothold in Iran. The Third Plan, as originally drawn up by
                        the Plan Organization, showed early promise of breaking through the
                        traditional hostility toward planned investment. After the fall of the Amini
                        government, however, the impetus toward meaningful planning was largely
                        lost. Anti-planning elements wielded strong influence in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA11">Alam</persName> government and succeeded in weakening
                        the Plan Organization and decentralizing responsibility for project
                        formulation and implementation. Consequently, the Third Plan reflects the
                        constant bureaucratic bickering as to how plan resources should be
                        allocated.</p>
                    <p>21. Under the <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> government the
                        outlook for the Third Plan has improved somewhat. Relatively few projects
                        without some intrinsic economic merit are contemplated. Even the “make-work”
                        projects in the program have utility for combatting recession and urban
                        employment. The plan also promises support for land reform and rural
                        development. Thanks to the rising oil income and good prospects for foreign
                        loans and credits, the financing of the Third Plan should not be a serious
                        problem. <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0076"/>Even so, the Plan
                        Organization is passing through a period of transformation and is unlikely
                        for some time to have sufficient authority and competence to give effective
                        direction to Iran's development. Thus, the Third Plan, which is supposed to
                        increase development expenditures more than two and a half times, will
                        probably fall considerably short of its goals.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>22. Thus far the land reform program has had no discernible effect on
                        agricultural production. Any disruptive effect has been more than offset by
                        good weather conditions over the past two years, and total agricultural
                        production may register a further increase this year. A relatively small
                        proportion of the land has been distributed to date, and most of the
                        government cooperatives which are to play an essential role in agricultural
                        management have been formed only on paper. The future of the agricultural
                        sector of the economy will depend in large measure on how successfully these
                        cooperatives fulfill their functions, particularly the management of Iran's
                        complicated irrigation system which has been the traditional task of the
                        landlords. If these management responsibilities are in fact well performed,
                        and if government plans to provide financial and technical assistance are
                        carried out, agricultural production is likely to increase.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">IV. The Domestic Outlook</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>23. The Shah apparently feels the need for a breathing spell in his reform
                        efforts in order to consolidate recent gains. The pace of land reform has
                        outstripped the government's administrative capacities, and little new land
                        is likely to be transferred in the near future. Yet it is unlikely that
                        awareness of this fact will arouse significant disappointment among the
                        peasantry, who have yet to display any political initiative of their own. In
                        any event, there is no ready vehicle for them to express their feelings, as
                        the Shah has effectively prevented the emergence of any mass leaders. While
                        it does not seem likely that the peasants will become an active force in
                        political life in the near future, it is possible that the Shah has fostered
                        the beginnings of a social transformation in the countryside.</p>
                    <p>24. The National Front opposition appears to have no great prospects at
                        present. Its various leaders will certainly interpret any slowdown of the
                        reform program as confirming their suspicions that the Shah intends no basic
                        reform of Iranian society. Yet they show no signs of being able to overcome
                        the factionalism that has prevented their movement from exerting effective
                        opposition or of developing a positive program of its own. Moreover, even
                        with the slowing of reform, the nationalists are unlikely to be very
                        successful in inducing the technicians, who recognize that the regime must
                        modernize to survive in the long run, to risk their government positions by
                        joining the opposition. Pressures for change, stimulated in part by the
                        reform program itself, will probably <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0077"
                        />grow and bring periodic turbulence. We do not believe, however, that any
                        of the opposition groups singly or in combination, will be able to pose a
                        serious challenge to the regime for the next few years, mainly because of
                        the reliability and efficiency of the security apparatus. In short, the
                        Shah's prospects for retaining control for the foreseeable future are
                        good.</p>
                    <p>25. In the past the Shah has been unwilling to permit any political
                        personality to consolidate independent power, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> is unlikely to be an exception. His
                        government, however, may be able to provide the administrative and technical
                        talent that the Shah feels is vital to carry out the reform program. In the
                        end he may, like other Prime Ministers, be a convenient scapegoat, should
                        political and economic frustrations build up again to the point of
                        demonstrations or open unrest. Tactics such as these have drawn fire away
                        from the monarchy in the past, and we believe they are likely to succeed
                        again.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Longer Term Outlook</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>26. Though it seems quite likely that change will continue to be evolutionary
                        for a number of years, it remains uncertain whether Iran will make the
                        ultimate transition to modern life without experiencing a violent
                        revolution. The odds are not as hopeless as they have sometimes appeared
                        when the regime has been faced with crisis. For some years to come it is
                        likely that Iran will pass through a period of consolidation in an effort to
                        assimilate recent changes. During this time the bureaucracy will probably
                        come increasingly to be dominated by the new class of technicians, who offer
                        the best hope for bridging the gap between the paternal administration of
                        the Shah and disaffected middle class elements.</p>
                    <p>27. As in the past, the Shah will continue to dictate the pace of these
                        developments. It is not certain that he will continue to push the reform
                        program energetically, although he seems now to see it as a design for
                        social and economic advance to which he has a personal commitment. His
                        tendency in the past, however, has been to use reform as a palliative when
                        pressed, and he may draw back once more. Nevertheless, the Shah does appear
                        convinced that his “White Revolution”has thus far been a notable success,
                        and his self-confidence has clearly been enhanced. Hence the chances now
                        seem good that he will continue to move forward, though with some pauses and
                        even retreats along the way.</p>
                    <p>28. Even if he persists, the success of the Shah's initiative for
                        evolutionary reform will depend in the long run on whether it evokes a
                        response in the country sufficient to be translated into broadened political
                        support for the regime. It is too soon yet to say that this will happen,
                        though if reform is pressed and enlarged in scope, it is not unreasonable to
                        believe that new and more constructive political formations will eventually
                        appear. The test would then be whether the Shah would be willing to share
                        power with the political forces he would have called into being. <pb n="50"
                            xml:id="pg_50" facs="0078"/>On this will depend also his ability to
                        attract and hold the first-class talent so badly needed for the tasks of
                        development. In any case, it seems clear that the Shah's reform effort has
                        already helped to stimulate and shape the forces which must eventually, in
                        one way or another, bring basic changes to Iranian society.</p>
                    <p>29. It is a basic weakness of Iran that the present equilibrium depends
                        almost exclusively on the Shah. The modernization that has taken place to
                        date has been largely administrative and economic, and little has been done
                        to create political institutions that would survive the death of the Shah.
                        Hence, should assassination or any other event remove him, the monarchy as
                        an institution would be endangered. The 44-year-old Shah has not allowed any
                        other figures to develop power in their own right, and the bureaucracy and
                        the parliament, though somewhat more respected than in the past, have as yet
                        no independent stature. Hence the military would almost immediately be drawn
                        into the political arena. A successor government, if controlled by the
                        senior officers, would probably, without attempting to reverse the Shah's
                        programs, pursue a generally more conservative course. However, if younger
                        officers gain a dominant voice, the government might reflect the more
                        radical outlook of the nationalist opposition. In any event, conditions
                        would be so disturbed that any successor regime would probably find it
                        difficult to consolidate power, and a prolonged period of instability would
                        probably ensue.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>30. Iran's strongly pro-Western orientation represents primarily the will of
                        the Shah. He is supported in this by the bureaucracy, and in particular the
                        military establishment. On the other hand, many of the intellectuals would
                        prefer a neutral course between East and West; indeed, this would be the
                        foreign policy which any National Front government would strive to
                        adopt.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Relations with the U.S.S.R.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>31. The most important development in Iran's foreign relations in recent
                        years has been the normalization of relations with the Soviet Union since
                        September 1962. At that time, Moscow accepted the Shah's pledge not to
                        permit the establishment of missile bases on his soil and shelved its policy
                        of open diplomatic and propaganda pressures to overthrow his regime. Thus,
                        without detracting from his Western ties, the Shah was able to end the
                        strong Soviet pressure which had kept tension high for many years. Soviet
                        acceptance of this gesture may indicate recognition, at least for the near
                        term, of the ineffectiveness of subversive efforts against the regime.</p>
                    <p>32. Yet neither the Shah nor the Kremlin has sought to do much more than
                        reduce tensions. After an initial flurry of sympathetic articles in the <pb
                            n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0079"/>Tehran press, the Iranian Government
                        intervened to reduce the volume and emphasis of pro-Soviet publicity. For
                        their part, the Soviets have not come forth with the expected proposals for
                        large-scale economic projects, though they have provided a $38.8 million
                        10-year credit for Iran. Communist propaganda beamed by clandestine radio
                        stations outside Iran still criticizes the regime.</p>
                    <p>33. The Shah will probably welcome continued improvement in Soviet relations
                        and may even pay increasing lip service to “nonalignment.” In any case, it
                        will be difficult for him to reject the friendship of a powerful neighbor
                        that claims to have changed its attitude and whose conduct is correct. A
                        policy of accommodation will also serve to some extent to appease the
                        neutralist and xenophobic sentiments of Iranians who believe their country
                        is overcommitted to the West. It would also counter the Shah's concern that,
                        with signs of a developing East-West detente, the U.S. might lose interest
                        in supporting and defending Iran against increased Soviet influence.
                        Nevertheless, Iranian fears of Soviet designs remain alive and will probably
                        serve to check any significant danger to Iran's Western orientation for the
                        period of this estimate.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>34. Iran's relationship with the U.S. appears to be undergoing a subtle
                        change. Though the American alliance remains the cornerstone of Iran's
                        foreign policy, the Shah, for reasons of domestic politics and international
                        prestige, sees a need to appear more independent. At the same time, the rise
                        of oil revenues, improving agricultural output, and the availability of
                        credits from other free world sources and the Soviet Bloc have reduced
                        Iran's dependence on US economic assistance. Accordingly US influence on
                        economic development is decreasing.</p>
                    <p>35. The same cannot be said of the security field, where Iran remains heavily
                        dependent on US assistance. The Shah was heartened by a US-Iranian exercise
                        which brought sizable numbers of American troops to Iran. [<hi rend="italic"

                        military aid plan has alleviated to some degree the Shah's dissatisfaction
                        with US military support. Thus we foresee a period of relative calm in US
                        military relations with Iran, probably until near the end of the military
                        aid plan in 1967.</p>

                    <p>36. The <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> alliance is important to Iran
                        as a formal defense link to the West and because it provides an additional
                        claim on the US for aid. This does not mean that Iran is fully satisfied
                        with the alliance. It has been irritated by the refusal of the US and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to consider alleged threats from
                        non-Communist regional states as falling within the purview of the alliance
                        and has suspected the US at times of having only a lukewarm interest in this
                        pact. Iran's dissatisfaction with <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>'s
                        economic achievements was greatly alleviated by the recent decision of the
                        US to <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0080"/>finance the Turkey-Iran rail
                        link. Under the circumstances, Iran can be expected to continue to be
                        cooperative in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, although not without
                        criticisms of specific aspects of the alliance.</p>
                    <p>37. The Shah's chief regional concern is his fear that Nasser is actively
                        plotting to overthrow his regime, working through Iraq and the Persian Gulf
                        Sheikhdoms. Though Nasser has recently made some overtures to improve
                        relations, the Shah remains wary. In fact, he is likely to pursue a more
                        active policy to counter <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> activities
                        directed at the Persian Gulf. Relations with Afghanistan have improved
                        markedly since Iran served as mediator in the Afghanistan-Pakistan dispute,
                        and prospects for the future here are good.</p>

                        situation and the Shah's attitudes, which I hope will be useful to the
                        President and you in discussions with him. There is one important subject
                        which cannot be included because of the circulation such messages
                        receive.</p>
                    <p>A seldom discussed but vital element in our relationship with Iran is the
                        agreement of the Shah which permits us to continue a series of U.S.
                        technical intelligence operations in various parts of Iran. For the most
                        part, the nature of many of these activities is such that they cannot be
                        concealed from the public, and it is only through the Shah's approval, and
                        in certain instances through direct Iranian participation, that we are able
                        to continue these activities.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I should rather not specify the precise objectives or results obtained from
                        these activities which, I am told, are of critical value to us. However,
                        John McCone could inform you of how important they are to our national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>My point in raising this sensitive matter with you at this time is to make
                        certain that at the top level of our Government, on the eve of the Shah's
                        visit to Washington, there is realization of this particular benefit which
                        we derive from our relationship with the Shah, and of the fact that he,
                        having personally assumed full responsibility for supporting and protecting
                        these activities, has never sought a quid pro quo for them or tried to
                        blackmail us because of them. We should not allow a situation to develop
                        where the Shah would be tempted to resort to such practice. The importance
                        of these facilities in Iran would become even greater if by any unhappy
                        chance, owing to policy changes in Pakistan, we should be deprived of
                        similar facilities in that country.</p>
                    <p>For these and other reasons our relationship with the Shah and with Iran is
                        an important one and I very much hope it will be possible for us to show a
                        flexible attitude during the Shah's visit to Washington, particularly in
                        relation to his desires for continuing U.S. assistance in the modernization
                        of his military establishment. I should be grateful if you would show this
                        letter to the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">On June 12 Secretary

                            obviate the likelihood that he would be tempted to use the intelligence
                            facilities as a basis for undue pressure in the near future. (Department

                    <p rend="center">VISIT TO WASHINGTON, JUNE 5, 1964</p>
                    <p rend="center">THE IRANIAN REFORM PROGRAM</p>
                    <p>Shortly after Vice President Johnson's visit to Iran in August 1962, the Shah
                        personally assumed leadership of a program of reforms, some of which had
                        been launched by the Amini Government before its fall in mid-1962. In the
                        absence of Parliament, the Shah in January 1963 put to a referendum and won
                        overwhelming endorsement for a six-point reform program, the most
                        significant elements of which were land reform and an Education Corps
                        modelled on our Peace Corps. Subsequently, other elements have been added to
                        the original program, most notably enfranchisement of women and a Health
                        Corps.</p>
                    <p>While the execution of the program has been spotty, certain aspects have
                        gained considerable momentum and give the impression that some fundamental
                        changes are at last under way in the long-static Iranian society. An
                        election in the Fall of 1963, although carefully controlled by the Shah and
                        barred to the opposition, nevertheless avoided the more blatant rigging of
                        earlier elections. It brought into being a pro-reform Parliament and ended
                        an unconstitutional parliamentary interregnum of more than two years. In
                        March 1964 the Shah appointed a new Government of younger technocrat
                        elements headed by <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Hasan Ali Mansur</persName>,
                        who is concentrating on certain key administrative reforms (budget, civil
                        service) and on attempts to spur a business revival through an increased
                        level of public investments and economic policies favorable to private
                        business.</p>
                    <p>In espousing basic reforms the Shah alienated the landlords and conservative
                        clergy which had formed the principal base of his support, but failed to
                        overcome the pre-existing opposition of the pro-Mosadeqist “nationalists.”
                        While these externally disparate elements have not in most instances joined
                        forces, the conservative groups were powerful enough in the summer of 1963
                        to incite severe rioting in Tehran and other cities. This was suppressed
                        without great difficulty by the Shah's military and security forces, and a
                        threatened repetition of the rioting this summer has so far been forestalled
                        by precautionary measures. These military and security forces have a high
                        degree of reliability and increasing <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0083"
                        />technical capability. Their methods can be vigorous when necessary and
                        they are feared by some elements of the population. However, they have not
                        been used by the regime to institute an atmosphere of widespread repression,
                        even against the conservative opponents of reform.</p>
                    <p>The Shah is clearly exhilarated by the initial progress of his reform
                        program, particularly his own success in having overcome his dependence on
                        the anti-reform elements in Iranian society. Although he is undoubtedly
                        sincere in espousing the reforms as an essential feature (along with
                        economic development) of the modernization of his country, he is also
                        acutely conscious of the effect of the reforms on world opinion,
                        particularly in the U.S. In describing the reforms to foreigners, he is apt
                        to exaggerate greatly their success and to confuse promise with fulfillment.
                        We thus find it necessary from time to time, while expressing appreciation
                        for his reform efforts, to remind him that we see them as only a beginning.
                        In order to avoid the appearance of patronizing him, we have couched such
                        strictures in terms of comparisons with the United States, where, in spite
                        of the maturity of economic and institutional development, there remain
                        grave areas of concern, such as poverty and race relations.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In the course of the Shah's unofficial visit to the United States, he will
                        talk with the President for an hour on June 5. This talk will be followed by
                        a White House luncheon for the Shah.</p>
                    <p>Briefing papers for the President are being prepared in this bureau of the
                        Department of State, and several of these will be forwarded to <gloss
                            target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> shortly for clearance. All of the subjects
                        except one which we expect to come up are non-operational, and we expect no
                        difficulties in obtaining <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0084"/>clearances
                        on those portions of the briefing materials dealing with general political
                        and economic affairs or with Persian Gulf problems.</p>
                    <p>The enclosed drafts,<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">Not printed.</note> which are
                        to be incorporated in the Talking Paper and Background Paper, respectively,
                        deal with military assistance, which, as you know from recent messages from
                        Tehran and from <gloss target="#t_CINCMEAFSA1">CINCMEAFSA</gloss>,
                        constitutes the critical item which will largely determine the long-term
                        results of the Shah's meeting with the President.</p>
                    <p>We feel that it is vital for the President to be able to indicate clearly to
                        the Shah that his problems of military equipment are being sympathetically
                        considered at the highest levels of the United States Government. As a
                        minimum, we feel that the President must be able to make a concrete offer to
                        the Shah responsive to the Shah's current primary concern—the replacement
                        during the next few years of aging M–47 tanks.</p>
                    <p>We are aware that there is some division of opinion in the Department of
                        Defense as to the relative value of the M–48A3 and the M–60 tanks for supply
                        to Iran. We feel quite certain, however, that the Shah greatly prefers the
                        M–60, and that the President's offer should emphasize the availability of
                        the M–60.</p>
                    <p>We are further aware that there is some difference of opinion as to whether
                        or not the still-experimental Sheridan might be made a part of any
                        commitment to supply tanks to Iran in the future. We are assuming that the
                        stage of development of this tank is such that no such commitment may be
                        made, despite the Shah's known interest in that vehicle.<note n="3"

                            there were so many variables regarding the Sheridan that it was

                    <p>We would hope that <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> might be able to
                        provide technical tab papers on these tanks and a summary table outlining
                        the current Five-Year <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Plan for Iran.</p>
                    <p>Members of your staff have indicated informally to members of my staff that
                        the possibility of a substantial proportion of M–60's being supplied under
                        grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is completely out of the question.
                        We have therefore confined the offer in our draft to one of sale only.
                        However, the Shah, at the time of agreement on the current Five-Year Plan,
                        specifically made reservations in respect to the adequacy of the proposed
                        tank component, and we informed him that we would review this element of the
                        Plan later. Furthermore, we note that thirty grant M–60's for Iran have been
                        included in <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>'s <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> submission for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 66 as a non-commitment item, and that the submission is
                        within the current EUCOM <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> ceiling for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64–69. I would therefore appreciate
                        your reviewing the problem to make certain that it will not be possible for
                        the President to <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0085"/>combine his sale
                        offer with a commitment to supply thirty M–60's under grant <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> before the end of 1967. Should this be
                        possible, the beneficial effect on our military and political objectives of
                        the President's talk with the Shah would be greatly increased.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d26fn4">In his response Sloan pointed out that since no other
                            country had received M–60 tanks as grant aid, the Department of Defense
                            did not want to establish a precedent; therefore, it recommended that
                            they be sold as planned.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am aware that the problem of tank production and supply is at present a
                        delicate one, and that it will not be easy for <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                            >DOD</gloss> to make firm and quick decisions. Nevertheless, we feel it
                        is imperative that the President be able to talk to the Shah in specific
                        terms. In addition to the obvious broad political effects of this talk, we
                        are convinced that it may prove to be a major fork in the road determining
                        whether or not we are to continue to maintain our position as the primary
                        source of equipment and military influence in Iran. The Shah's political and
                        financial position is such that he is now capable of shopping in world
                        markets for military equipment. We believe he will do so unless we continue
                        to retain his confidence in us as his primary source of supply.</p>
                    <p>I would appreciate your clearance and/or comments on the enclosed draft

                        his current concerns may be helpful in connection with the preparations for
                        his forthcoming visit. As I shall not be present, I am submitting this
                        statement, which represents the views of the Country Team, and recommend
                        that it be also submitted to the Pres.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0086"/>
                    <p>When the Shah was last in Wash in April 1962, he was in a depressed and
                        insecure mood and needed to be reassured that we thought he was on the right
                        track with his reform program, that we admired his steadfastness in the face
                        of <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> threats and blandishments, and that
                        he had our continuing political and military support. He has changed a good
                        deal since that time. Now he is in a buoyant mood, convinced (with some
                        justification) that his internal program is a success, that his regime is
                        secure, and that he has managed the foreign affairs of his country wisely.
                        But he is gravely disturbed by recent trends in the Arab world. He still
                        requires reassurance that we are with him, that we admire him, and that we
                        understand his current concerns.</p>
                    <p>In foreign affairs, the Shah continues to stand squarely with the free world
                        and considers his country the only stable ally we have between Suez and the
                        Sea of Japan. Although he has “normalized” his relations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> Union, he continues staunchly
                        anti-Communist and in fact is sometimes inclined to suspect us of going too
                        far in the direction of a detente. Last year he was acutely worried by talk
                        of a possible non-aggression pact between <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact countries and felt that this could
                        force him into an unwanted accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_Sov1"
                            >Sov</gloss> Union; but we managed to convince him that those worries
                        were unfounded.</p>
                    <p>Today his principal concern in foreign and military affairs is with Arab (and
                        especially Nasser's) designs on the oil-rich Iranian province of Khuzistan
                        which is inhabited by about one million Iranian Arabs. He recognizes that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> does not at present have the
                        capability to make serious trouble for him in Khuzistan, but he sees a
                        long-term trend of British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf area and has
                        been especially disturbed by the recent political and military agreements
                        between the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iraq. At present he is
                        more concerned with the Arab threat than with the threat of <gloss
                            target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> expansionism. Persistently misreading our
                        policy, he is inclined to feel—as many of our allies do—that we are too
                        friendly toward neutralists like Nasser, whom he likes to picture as a
                            <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> tool.</p>
                    <p>On the internal scene, the Shah's control of his country is, if anything,
                        still tighter than it was two years ago. He has recently called in a new
                        team of younger people to run his govt, and that new Cabinet (under
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Hasan Ali Mansur</persName>) is pushing
                        forward with a number of much-needed reforms, including civil service
                        reform, a much-needed new approach to budgeting, and a general overhaul of
                        the administrative machinery. There are also indications that the <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> govt is managing to gain the
                        confidence of the business community and thus to bring about a much-needed
                        recovery of the private sector. The Shah is probably unwilling to face the
                        fact that in the cities, and particularly among the intelligentsia, his
                        regime has yet to generate enthusiastic support. He <pb n="59"
                            xml:id="pg_59" facs="0087"/>continues unable to delegate authority and
                        is probably convinced that past American advice to that effect was proved
                        wrong by events.</p>
                    <p>Perennially, our problem with the Shah has been to keep his military program
                        in balance with his vitally important programs for social and economic
                        reform. Our five-year program of military assistance, agreed in 1962, has
                        been highly successful in maintaining this balance. Recently he has become
                        concerned with the replacement of items (especially the M–47 tank, but also
                        the F–86 and C–47 aircraft), which will soon become unsupportable, and
                        wanted to discuss what will happen after expiration of the five-year
                        program. In repeated and intensive discussions with him, we have tried here
                        during the past weeks to bring his current requests down to the level where
                        they are reasonable both from the military and from the economic-political
                        points of view, and it now appears that we have had some measure of success;
                        but there is no doubt that the recent <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                        >UAR</gloss>-Iraq agreement has made him view the replacement program with
                        even greater urgency. Especially the tank problem is now his central
                        military preoccupation.</p>
                    <p>Iran's attitude toward U.S. military aid is changing as the country's
                        financial position is improving. A reasonable transition of our <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> from grant aid to a mixture of U.S. grant
                        assistance, extension of credit, and sales for cash—within the limits of a
                        new, jointly arrived, reasonable program—is now the crucial requirement of
                        our continued close relations with Iran.</p>
                    <p>It would be desirable that the conversation between the President and the
                        Shah not dwell exclusively on military matters. The Shah regards himself as
                        a world statesman and will be flattered by a discussion of world affairs. It
                        would also be useful to remind the Shah in the course of the conversation
                        that, while we will continue to help him in meeting his military problems,
                        we consider his economic and social development programs of fundamental
                        importance for the long-term stability of his country. While much has been
                        done, a great deal more still remains to be done. Since the Shah is
                        currently inclined to be overly optimistic about Iran's future oil income,
                        the President might make the desired point by discussing the problem all
                        national leaders have in allocating scarce resources and by expressing the
                        thought that estimates of future resources are often over-optimistic and
                        that there is no end to the competition between conflicting requirements, so
                        that there is always need for a careful establishment of priorities.</p>
                    <p>The Shah is a genuine friend of the U.S. He has turned to us for advice on
                        most important problems and cooperates with us in many fields, including
                        some highly classified ones that are of great importance to us. His popular
                        image abroad and at home has improved since he launched his reform program.
                        His current preoccupation with military problems in the Persian Gulf has
                        some justification. We hope that he will feel that <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60"
                            facs="0088"/>he has gained the personal understanding of the President
                        for those problems and particularly that the President understands the need
                        for certain more modern types of equipment for his armed forces, within the
                        framework of a new agreed, long-term program that is being worked out.<note

                        <item>The Shah of Iran is due to arrive in Washington on 4 June to open a
                            “7,000 Years of Persian Art” exhibit at the National Gallery. Although
                            he is on an unofficial visit, he is scheduled to see the President, as
                            well as other top officials. The Shah is also scheduled to receive
                            honorary degrees from American University and from the University of
                            California at Berkeley before he leaves the country about 13 June. He
                            has visited the US on four previous occasions, unofficially in 1954–55
                            and 1958, and officially in 1949 and 1962. The principal problem
                            anticipated during this trip is hostile demonstrations by Iranian
                            students, particularly in California. Such demonstrations against the
                            Iranian Government have been a perennial problem in this country, and a
                            number of sizable ones occurred in Europe during the Shah's visit to
                            Austria and Italy last winter.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Shah's short title is His Imperial Majesty Mohammad Reza Shah
                            Pahlavi. Now age 44, he is an intelligent and personable individual,
                            fluent in English and French, with a taste for sports—tennis, riding,
                            skiing, flying—and an interest in art and literature as well as in
                            attractive women. He has been married three times: to the sister of
                            ex-king Farouk (1939); to the well-known Soraya, the daughter of a minor
                            tribal chief and a German national (1951); and to the present Queen,
                            Farah, who comes from an old Azerbaijan family (1959). The long-desired
                            heir, Prince <persName corresp="#p_PMR1">Reza</persName>, was born in
                            1960. The Shah has two daughters, one born last year and one by his
                            first wife.</item>

                        <item>The Shah has been on the throne, ruling most of the time as well as
                            reigning, since 1941, when his father was ousted by the Allies. The
                            father was an army officer who seized the throne to found the Pahlavi
                            dynasty. The Shah's beginning and finishing education was military; in
                            between he spent four years in schools in Switzerland. His interest in
                            the army and in military affairs generally is thus a product of his
                            educational background as well as of a preoccupation with Iran's
                            security problems.</item>

                        <item>The Shah's family has not been among his assets. His father was
                            disliked and feared, his twin sister leads an uninhibited personal life
                            allegedly engaging in such doubtful business enterprises as opium
                            smuggling and his half-brothers have generally been kept in obscurity.
                            The <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0090"/>political philosophy of many
                            of the Shah's court intimates appears to be late eighteenth century

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>From this background, the Shah has emerged, particularly in the past
                            ten years, as a sensitive, often moody, but nonetheless able proponent
                            of the modernization of his country—under his direction. Since the
                            overthrow of the Mossadeq regime in 1953 he has operated largely as a
                            dictator, with a thin facade of parliamentary democratic procedures. He
                            has confronted, with some considerable skill, a situation in which a
                            rising middle class has agitated restlessly for greater political power
                            and accelerated economic and social change, while vested
                            interests—landed aristocracy, obscurantist clergy, and tribal
                            chieftains—have venomously opposed all attempts at reform.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The present phase of the Shah's reform program began in earnest two
                            years ago. Its main points are the redistribution of land, electoral
                            reform including the enfranchisement of women, profit sharing among
                            industrial workers, the nationalization of forests, the formation of a
                            literacy corps, and provision for the compensation of expropriated
                            landlords. Land reform is the key aspect of the program, and substantial
                            progress has been made. There are indications, however, that the program
                            will soon be temporarily slowed to allow the administrative
                            apparatus—surveys, etc.—to catch up. The new cabinet, under Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Hasan Ali Mansur</persName>, is
                            pledged to undertake administrative reforms to consolidate the
                            achievements of the “white revolution.” The hyper-skeptical Iranian
                            public, however, is likely to view this development as an indication
                            that the vested interests have gained a round.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Shah's opponents are able to unite only on the issue of his
                            “dictatorial and unconstitutional” methods of governing. The principal
                            opposition vehicle is a National Front, whose core comes from the upper
                            and middle classes. However, the development of a unified opposition is
                            handicapped not only by the disparity of views among its elements—which
                            run from the Muslim mullahs to the Communist Tudeh Party, heavily
                            infiltrated by the government's security organs—but also by the basic
                            appeal that the land reform program has made in an overwhelmingly
                            peasant country. The opposition has been placed in the position of
                            trying to oppose the Shah while avoiding opposition to a popular program
                            with which he is personally identified. There are in fact some signs
                            that younger members of the middle class, who are now taking up their
                            “class positions” in the government bureaucracy, are rallying to the
                            government, at least in the sense that they seem to be working
                            diligently to make the Shah's program a success.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>This tendency is not evident, however, among the students in the U.S.
                            who are likely to cause trouble during his visit. Iranian young people
                            who study abroad are almost invariably from the upper class,
                            particularly those in the US. Many oppose the Shah because of family
                            memories of <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0091"/>past cruelties
                            committed by his father. Others are genuinely disturbed by the
                            “dictatorship,” by the omnipresence of the security police, and probably
                            by their own sense of frustration over the slowness with which Iranian
                            society seems able to change. At the same time, there is evidence that
                            many Iranian student leaders in Europe and in the US are supported in
                            part with funds from Communist sources and/or have become ideologically
                            attached to left-wing movements.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>The Shah calls his foreign policy “positive nationalism.” Its basic
                            pro-Western orientation is a reflection of his personal position rather
                            than of any widespread popular sentiment. Many Iranian intellectuals in
                            fact would prefer a neutralist position, and oppose Iran's membership in
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and its 1959 mutual defense
                            pact with the US. Iran's heavy dependence on US aid since World War II
                            is currently undergoing a subtle change as the country's oil revenues
                            improve its financial position. The Shah nonetheless continues to

                        <item>The Shah's relations with the U.S.S.R. are diplomatically correct at
                            the moment. Soviet propaganda against him has slackened since Moscow
                            accepted his 1962 pledge not to allow foreign missile bases on Iranian
                            territory. Soviet President Brezhnev visited Iran last year, and the
                            U.S.S.R. extended a ten-year credit of $38.8 million to finance a
                            project to harness the Aras River, which forms the Iranian-Soviet
                            frontier in northwestern Iran.</item>

                    <p>Evening June 1 I had two-hour audience with Shah. He discoursed along usual
                        lines on Arab threat and Iran's need to prepare for own defense, although
                        calmly and without emotion. I then opened part of conversation covering
                        military requirements with friendly but pointed remarks on value of good
                        professional military advice based on factual analyses, emphasizing
                        particularly the value of sound negative advice, and noted we agreed at
                        Dezful (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1008)<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d30fn3">

                        professional views re replacement program without regard to source of
                        financing. All exchanges recent weeks we considered in this context and it
                        now probably time for Shah examine all advice and decide what he wished to
                        propose.</p>
                    <p>I noted that too rapid introduction of new weapons systems would be likely to
                        overtax facilities for maintenance and utilization, not only for new weapons
                        and equipment, but also for existing equipment. It was judgment our military
                        people that overall combat capabilities of Iranian armed forces would
                        thereby be significantly reduced during immediate future about which Shah
                        appeared most concerned, Shah seemed to be seriously impressed by this
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>I once again called Shah's attention to need for balanced use of resources in
                        order not to impair development program. I said it appeared <pb n="65"
                            xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"/>oil revenues were rising nicely but best
                        projections we able make suggested 1970 level not be quite so high as Shah
                        previously indicated. Also foreign exchange projections indicated there
                        would be period of squeeze to fulfill planned development in next few years
                        and for two years or so Iran might well be drawing on foreign exchange
                        reserves. Shah appeared bothered by this but seemed to hoist in its
                        implications.</p>
                    <p>Shah then said he thought <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss>
                        probably right, <gloss target="#t_SCS1">SCS</gloss> program too rapid, it
                        would be wiser to get 17 tanks for training by end Iranian year, March 1965,
                        instead of August 1964 and have six months (instead of four months) program
                        for introduction tanks into each battalion.</p>
                    <p>I suggested Shah's proposals be set down in writing by <gloss
                            target="#t_SCS1">SCS</gloss> and I would send them to Washington with
                        the request that they be considered with regard to availabilities and terms.
                        I said time would not permit answers during Shah's visit and he expressed
                        understanding but hoped there could be some agreement in principle with
                        questions regarding availabilities and terms to be worked out later.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Shah has accepted substantial validity our
                        views and modified his proposals appreciably to accommodate them, although
                        his proposed deliveries still call for rather tight schedule. However, I
                        believe they now provide basis on which we can work out details of mutually
                            <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>acceptable program and preserve
                        present valuable military relations with Shah.</p>
                    <p>Immediate problem is tanks. If we can be forthcoming on tanks during Shah's
                        visit, our relations with Iran will be greatly strengthened and success of
                        visit assured. I strongly recommend that we by able to tell Shah we are
                        prepared to sell Iran 17 M–60's for delivery by March, 1965 and to make
                        subsequent deliveries, production rates permitting, at rate approximating
                        his schedule. Would be helpful if we could also indicate we would try to
                        work out some credit arrangements for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66
                        deliveries.</p>
                    <p>If tanks problem resolved, discussion of program covering other items can
                        proceed here at less rapid pace except for C–130's on which Shah will want
                        early answer. For this discussion we will need to know soon level of credit

                        scheduled to meet with him for one hour at Noon on Friday June 5.</p>
                    <p>The Shah was last in the United States, on an official visit, in April 1962.
                        You last saw him on your visit to Iran in August 1962. That was shortly
                        before he personally assumed leadership of a basic reform program in Iran.
                        He is exhilarated, perhaps overly so, about the apparent initial successes
                            <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0095"/>of that program. Although
                        basically a moody man, subject to periods of discouragement, depression, and
                        doubts as to our intentions, he is at present enjoying a high degree of
                        self-confidence because of the consolidation of his political position at
                        home, as well as Iran's growing financial strength. He feels these
                        developments allow him scope for more independence in foreign policy
                        (exemplified by Iran's improved relations with the Soviet Union), but he
                        recognizes Iran's dependence on the U.S. for security and continues to seek
                        our advice on all important matters. His principal concerns at the moment
                        are two related ones: his fears of aggression from the Arab world; and
                        Iran's requirements for further military modernization. A secure,
                        long-range, close military relationship with the U.S. is necessary if these
                        concerns are to be satisfied and our influence in Iran is to be maintained
                        in the future.</p>
                    <p>The Shah will leave the U.S. on June 14 for a visit with the Sultan of
                        Morocco.</p>

                    <p>The Five-Year Plan for the reorganization and modernization of the Iranian
                        armed forces, drawn up jointly and now being implemented, seems to be
                        working out quite well. Granted adequate Congressional appropriations, we
                        intend to continue to do our part in this program, and we are sure Iran will
                        continue to do its part.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased that United States and Iranian officers are now discussing the
                        shape of additional measures of replacement, modernization and training
                        which will permit further improvement in Iran's defensive strength through
                        the sixties and into the seventies. These plans should be analyzed carefully
                        by both governments, with the view toward achieving a rational increase in
                        military potential without limiting unduly the resources available for
                        economic development and social welfare, which are also essential components
                        of a broad security concept. Our various Joint <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> exercises (especially the recent successful Operation
                            <gloss target="#t_DELAWAR1">DELAWAR</gloss>) and the recent exercises
                        involving the Concord Squadron demonstrate to us all the fact that United
                        States and Iranian military capacities are mutually complementary.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the Shah's greatest area of concern at present is in the
                        replacement of tanks. In view of the shortage of United States military
                        assistance funds, and Iran's growing economic strength, we will not be able
                        to provide replacements of Iran's needs on a grant basis. We can, however,
                        sell Iran up to 150 of our new M–60 tanks, to come off production lines
                        during the next two or three years, along with the necessary spares and
                        ancillary equipment. These tanks would be delivered to Iran at the same time
                        that they are being put in service with our own forces, and at the same
                        price we must pay, plus handling and transportation.</p>
                    <p>Iran could pay for the tanks on the same basis that we ourselves make
                        payments to the manufacturers. If this is not possible for Iran, we would be
                        willing to discuss limited credit arrangements. If these tanks are too
                        expensive, the Shah could be offered a rebuilt tank of the M–48 series,
                        retrofitted with the 105-mm gun, the M–48A3, at a cheaper price.</p>

                    <p>A radically new tank, the Sheridan, may be produced later in this decade. No
                        decision has yet been made to put it in production, and any discussions of
                        procuring this vehicle are just not possible at present.</p>

                    <p>The Shah's visit is mostly an exercise in political massage. Like all our
                        clients, he will be reassured simply to touch base with you (we didn't
                        invite him, but laid on a brief meeting once he decided to come collect a
                        few honorary degrees).</p>
                    <p>A good personal relationship between you and the Shah is more and more
                        essential to our influence in Iran. We've helped Iran generously ($1.5
                        billion since 1947) but our aid is dropping sharply as Iranian oil revenues
                        mount ($450 million this year, probably $800 million by 1970—the Shah
                        estimates even higher). For example, we're now in the middle of a 5-year
                        $300 million 1962–66 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program, but expect
                        to shift later to a sales basis, because Iran can now afford it. So our
                        chief problem becomes one of periodically reassuring this moody monarch,
                        especially since he actually runs Iran.</p>
                    <p>Though we've kept telling the Shah that his real problems are internal not
                        external, and that reform is first on the agenda, he keeps reverting to the
                        military toys he loves. We've convinced him there isn't much chance of
                        Soviet attack, so now he's talking up an Arab threat as his excuse. His main
                        interest just now is replacing his aging M–47 tanks. M–48A3s like the
                        Israelis want would be cheaper and more than ample, but he wants our new
                        M–60s. To avoid a discussion about hardware, you might tell him right off
                        that we can't provide tanks as grant aid but will sell him some when
                        available; you've directed Defense to work out the details. He'll settle for
                        this, because in his January letter to you he candidly offered to buy such
                        equipment if Congress cut <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds too
                        short. Nor <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="099"/>do we want to commit
                        ourselves to any <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> grant program for the
                        period after our present arrangement runs out in 1967, but we can assure him
                        we'll continue to work with him.</p>
                    <p>It's worth telling the Shah that we are beefing up our own strength in the
                        Indian Ocean area by frequent carrier deployments (he recently attended a
                        weapons demonstration on one). This gives us far greater combat power in the
                        area, and is aimed largely at backing up Iran against the U.S.S.R. or the
                        Arabs.</p>
                    <p>We want to reassure the Shah about the “Arab” threat. He runs scared of
                        Nasser. For example, we don't think the vague new “unity agreement” between
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iraq adds up to much. Since
                        you've been so heavily immersed this week in Arab-Israeli affairs via the
                        Eshkol visit, you might use that as a handle for expounding our view that
                        the Arabs aren't much of a military threat. The Shah also keeps beefing
                        about our making Nasser our “chosen instrument” in the Middle East. It would
                        help if you made clear that: (a) we're not naive about Nasser—we're simply
                        trying to keep him from leaning too far toward Moscow—this is in Iran's
                        interest as much as ours; (b) we aren't really giving Nasser much aid except
                        food which he can't convert into arms; and (c) we are still in effect
                        containing Nasser by our aid to Israel, Jordan, Saudis, Sudan, and Libya as
                        well as Iran.</p>
                    <p>After rebutting the Shah's security preoccupations, we hope you can shift the
                        conversation to his reform program. We still see this as his best defense
                        against subversion—the real threat from both Moscow and Cairo. We've waged a
                        successful campaign since the economic crisis of mid-1961 to shift his
                        attention from defense to domestic economic progress. His land reform
                        program is going fairly well, and two good harvests have eased initial
                        dislocations. But the economy in the urban areas still hasn't fully
                        recovered (though it's beginning to snap back now that public spending is
                        picking up) and the Shah still needs to get the city people behind him along
                        with the peasants.</p>
                    <p>So we've got to convince the Shah that he's only begun the modernization
                        process, and has to keep at it. We also want to nip in the bud any notion
                        that he can relax as oil revenues climb. No matter how much money there is,
                        demands are always so great that careful priorities have to be set. The
                        Shah's new government under <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Ali
                            Mansur</persName> has recently taken steps to improve its machinery. But
                        to keep his nose to the grindstone, you might mention how important you
                        consider his new Budget Agency, his new Civil Service Code, and his plans
                        for tax reform. You could also explain the rationale of your anti-poverty
                        campaign. We want him to catch some of your enthusiasm for domestic
                        reform.</p>
                    <p>Since the Shah will stop off in Morocco on his way home, I suggest you ask
                        him to convey your regards to King Hassan. You might also enlist his aid to
                            <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0100"/>get Hassan too focussed on the
                        need for sound administration and reform.</p>

                        like to get across to him. I'd strongly urge that (as with Eshkol) you get

                            n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0102"/>by 1 July 1965. It is proposed that
                        we approve a sale for this requirement totaling $10 million ($2.2 million
                        each, plus spares) and advise the Shah of this approval during his current
                        visit to Washington. The Air Force has indicated that four C–130B's are
                        available and could be rehabilitated and delivered by that date assuming the
                        sale is consummated by 1 July 1964. The Air Force, in turn, would procure
                        four C–130E's for replacement to its inventory within the 22 months
                        lead-time.</p>
                    <p>The question of credit may arise if the Iranians cannot meet the sale under
                        dependable undertaking, our recommended starting position. In this event,
                        the following credit terms under Section 508 of the Foreign Assistance Act
                        of 1961, as amended, are recommended for your approval (State/<gloss

                    <p>The Shah's meeting with the President yesterday was warm and cordial. As
                        expected, the Shah devoted considerable attention to the following <pb
                            n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0103"/>subjects: Arab designs on Khuzistan,
                        which he said were now backed by Khrushchev, who is anxious to deny Middle
                        East oil to the West; the consequent need for enhanced Iranian defensive
                        capabilities; the suitability of Bendar Abbas for use by the United States
                        for a base; and the Shah's fears that the oil companies would give
                        preferential treatment to Arab producing countries now that <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> had become what the Shah called an
                        “instrument of Arab imperialism”.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the latter point, the President told the Shah that we
                        would speak to the oil companies about the Shah's misgivings. At the White
                        House luncheon, following the private meeting, both the President and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> spoke to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WWH1">Howard W. Page</persName> of Standard Oil of New
                        Jersey and Mr. <persName>George</persName> Parkhurst of Standard Oil of
                        California, emphasizing United States Government interest in seeing that the
                        companies treat Iran fairly. Later in the afternoon Messrs. Page and
                        Parkhurst called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and
                        reiterated their appreciation of Iran's situation and the agreement of the
                        companies to ensure fair treatment for Iran in the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> negotiations. Details of this discussion are included in
                        the attached memorandum of conversation. It would be very helpful if you
                        would reassure the Shah further on this point and convey to him the
                        assurances expressed by Messrs. Page and Parkhurst.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that the discussions with the Shah at the 5 p.m. “tea” will be
                        concerned mainly with military affairs, specifically the Shah's program for
                        military modernization and the possibilities of United States sales of
                        modern tanks and transport aircraft to Iran to cover the most urgent
                        replacement needs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> will be
                        present at the “tea“, and the other guests will be:</p>

                                        They could be made available starting in March 65 as
                                        requested. The U.S. Army had developed two A–3 modifications
                                        of the M–48 which were felt to be about equal to the <pb
                                            n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0105"/>M–60 in performance
                                        and about $100,000 cheaper per tank. The first modification
                                        was being applied to 1000 tanks for use by the U.S. Army and
                                        Marines. It has the same engine and operating range as the
                                        M–60. The 90mm gun is retained in order to permit the use of
                                        large stocks of 90mm ammunition for training. Also a HEAT
                                        round has been developed that gives the gun about the same
                                        range as the 105mm gun of the M–60. The second modification
                                        has the same engine and gun as the M–60. The principal
                                        advantage of the M–60 is in a slightly smoother silhouette.
                                        Since this latter modification is not presently contemplated
                                        by the U.S. Army, it could not be accomplished as rapidly as
                                        the first, which is now underway.</p>
                                    <p>The Shah expressed concern that spare parts would become a
                                        problem with the M–48 as they have for the M–47. Mr.
                                            <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> stated that
                                        the M–48 would be in the inventory of the U.S. Army as long
                                        as the M–60 and until a main battle tank was developed and
                                        available, estimated to be in the early 1970s. The Shah
                                        expressed concern that this conversion to a new tank would
                                        not be completed until 1969 which would not leave much
                                        useful life if spare parts became short in the early 70s.
                                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> assured him
                                        that it was U.S. present policy that spare parts would be
                                        maintained for all military equipment provided to allies as
                                        long as the equipment was in use. Mr. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> (White House) spoke
                                        up in strong support of the M–48 A–3 as being comparable to
                                        and more economical than the M–60. The Shah asked that he be
                                        given a detailed comparison of the three possibilities with
                                        a revised cost figure for the M–60 that would reflect the
                                        increased production schedule to accommodate Iran's
                                        requirement.</p>

                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> (State) introduced the problem that
                                he had observed in other developing countries and which he thought
                                was probably applicable to Iran. This was the difficulty in getting
                                industry to develop in such a way as to support and complement the
                                agricultural development. This was directly related to the
                                stimulation of proper marketing practices that are necessary if much
                                agricultural produce is not to be lost in the marketing process.
                                Specifically he mentioned the requirement for industry to take the
                                emphasis from production for Teheran and other cities and to
                                concentrate in producing things the farmers need and want: textiles,
                                farm implements and machinery, cheap radios, electricity, etc.
                                Otherwise the farmer will find that his increased productivity and
                                income have brought him no realization of his aspirations.</p>
                            <p>The Shah admitted this was a basic problem in Iran with which he

                    <p>Messrs. Page and Parkhurst then described the conversation they had just had
                        with the Shah. He had brought up nothing new, but merely emphasized how
                        important it was that the oil companies not submit to Arab “blackmail.” The
                        Shah, of course, would not be opposed to further concessions by the
                        companies, but they should first be offered to Iran.</p>
                    <p>Page and Parkhurst had reassured the Shah, explaining that they had already
                        told Dr. <persName>Fala</persName> that the companies would make no deals
                        with the Arabs behind Iran's back. Discussions had been going on with Yamani
                        of Saudi Arabia. Aramco's Brougham, who had just been talking with Yamani,
                        was due back in the U.S. tomorrow. The Brougham-Yamani talks were only
                        exploratory, of course, since Brougham was not empowered to negotiate for
                        the oil industry. If these talks indicated there might be some possibility
                        of reaching agreement with Saudi Arabia within the general framework of the
                        oil companies' offer, the companies had promised to inform Fala
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>There had been some discussion of petroleum economics, which the Shah
                        introduced by remarking that, in Iran at least, oil was no longer a
                        political problem, but solely an economic one. The Shah indicated that he
                        knew something of this subject, being aware, for example, that posted <pb
                            n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0108"/>prices were somewhat artificial and
                        that the companies make much of their profit in other operations—transport,
                        refining, etc. Page and Parkhurst had explained that it all depended where
                        one began. If one began on the basis of posted price, then the companies
                        made nothing on the other operations. But in reality they were able to
                        realize overall gains which, while less than those of many other industries,
                        were sufficient to keep them in business. They hoped by improving efficiency
                        to increase their margin of profit. Page and Parkhurst had also explained to
                        the Shah why the competition from other fuels made it impossible to raise
                        oil prices.</p>
                    <p>Returning to Arab affairs, the Shah had said that it was in Iran's interests
                        to remain on good terms with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. He thought the
                        companies shared this interest with Iran and that the U.S. Government's
                        interest paralleled that of the companies. The Shah thought highly of
                        Faysal. The big danger, in the Shah's mind, was Nasser and Nasserism. And
                        behind Nasser was Khrushchev.</p>
                    <p>The Shah had also encouraged the oil companies to invest in non-petroleum
                        activities in Iran. Page and Parkhurst had said the companies were indeed in
                        the process of studying possibilities for such investments.</p>

                        considerable attention to: Arab designs on Khuzistan, which he said now
                        backed by Khrushchev, who anxious deny oil to West; consequent need enhanced

                        about Shah's misgivings. Shah's luncheon toast consisted of ringing
                        reaffirmation firm commitment to West.</p>

                            >USG</gloss> intends to be responsive to his military modernization
                        requirements. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> reps suggested
                        consideration Cooperative Logistics Sales Agreement. Regarding tanks, Shah's
                        attention directed to M–48A3 as better priced substitute for M–60, which now
                        very high priced because of curtailed procurement schedule. Regarding
                        transport aircraft, we offered sale of four C–130's on favorable credit
                        terms for delivery by July 1965. There was less concrete discussion
                        concerning other modernization items. Shah was pleased with general
                        approach, requested further meeting with working level <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> on Monday, June 8, for more detailed
                        discussion modernization plan, particularly possibilities for reduction in
                        price of M–60 as result possible procurement by Iran.</p>
                    <p>At June 8 meeting, main emphasis was on tanks with Shah questioning sharply
                        price and characteristics data. Shah requested another meeting in New York
                        on 12 June at which time he would like to have firm information as to the
                        availability of the M–48A3 tank with the 105[mm] gun and, if possible, to
                        discuss a draft Cooperative Logistics Sales Agreement covering the entire
                        modernization program. Shah at no time asked for details about credit
                        availability or terms but assumed that this would be included in the
                        discussion of a Cooperative Logistics Sales Agreement.</p>

                        Shah addressed this group on Iranian economic problems, reform program,
                        political outlook. <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> group was well
                        impressed with his informed, balanced approach, particularly his grasp of
                        economic affairs, and believes international org reps were similarly
                        impressed. Shah acknowledged Iran's greatly improved economic prospects but
                        stressed need for continued foreign lending in interim in order to support
                        adequate pace economic development. He referred in appreciative terms to new
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> road loan and expressed hope for

                    <p>At the request of the Shah, Defense/State representatives met with him in New
                        York on June 12. The meeting was held in his suite in the Waldorf Astoria.
                        It began at 6:45 p.m. and lasted about an hour and twenty minutes. Since the
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> group arrived at about 6:40, we only
                        had a few minutes to discuss our position and no opportunity to see the
                        specific position papers which General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> utilized throughout the session.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere was friendly. The Shah had just arrived some minutes before
                        from Los Angeles. He appeared tired and somewhat melancholy. One had the
                        impression that the demonstrations in Los Angeles had depressed him. There
                        was a huge crowd in front of the Waldorf. According to the police, it was
                        entirely friendly with no demonstrators present. Nevertheless, the fact that
                        he had once again been confronted with a large crowd may have recalled to
                        his mind some of his irritation about what happened in Los Angeles. At one
                        stage in the discussion, the Shah said that he was subject to what one might
                        call an international conspiracy led by the communists with the active
                        assistance of Nasser and the Arabs. In one demonstration in Los Angeles,
                        according to the Shah, there were only six Iranians and the other
                        demonstrators seemed to have been American communists and Arab students. He
                        spoke with manifest irritation about an incident in Los Angeles; apparently
                        a plane flew over the ceremony at <gloss target="#t_UCLA1">UCLA</gloss>
                        carrying a banner that said “If you want a fix, see the Shah.” He said he
                        asked people “What is a fix?” and they told him it was heroin. He said with
                        bitterness that this smearing attack was made against him despite his
                        efforts to kill off this dirty drug. If I am involved in heroin, he added,
                        one should say that I am a terribly poor salesman and that I am working
                        against my “sales interest.”</p>
                    <p>He went on to say that he was going to stop off and see King Hassan who had
                        invited him to talk about Nasser. He said Hassan was having trouble with
                        Nasser, which is a common experience. He said Nasser was giving arms to the
                        Algerians to kill Moslem Moroccans; he was giving arms to Greek-Cypriots to
                        kill Turkish Moslems; he was threatening the life of the Shah, a Moslem.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the position agreed upon in Washington, the Shah was
                        informed that the United States is prepared to conclude a sales agreement in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 for 176 M–60 tanks and four C–130
                        transport planes with deliveries to occur on a phased basis. He was also
                        informed that we are prepared to begin negotiations at an early date in
                        Tehran of a broader program covering the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1965–69 period, which would include both credit and grant equipment
                        elements. Subject to Congressional authorizations, grant <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> would be continued in the three years after
                        the end of the current Five-Year Plan, namely in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1967, 1968, and 1969. It was emphasized that the United
                        States participation in the proposed negotiations would be under the
                        direction of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> who
                            <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0113"/>would be assisted by technicians
                        from Washington to the degree deemed necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Shah was clearly pleased by United States responsiveness in respect to
                        the modernization requirements of the Iranian military structure and by the
                        decision to continue <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> grants. He
                        indicated that he would begin preparations for negotiations as soon as he
                        returns to Tehran this week.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> was under direct
                        instructions from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        to inform the Shah that we would be prepared to begin the negotiations
                        within a week's time. I told General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> before the meeting started that he should carry out
                        his instructions, but that we would have to inform the Shah that other
                        elements of the American Government doubted our ability to hold the
                        discussions that quickly. Both these points were conveyed to the Shah and it
                        was evident that there was not a problem involved insofar as he was
                        concerned because he himself will not be ready as quickly as the Secretary
                        had hoped. It seems probable that a target date of about July 8 would be
                        logical. If a Team arrives much before that date, it is likely to cool its
                        heels waiting for the Iranians.</p>
                    <p>It will be recalled that the Department of Defense had strongly desired the
                        preparation and submission to the Shah of a detailed memorandum of
                        understanding which ostensibly would have been initialed by him. We had
                        opposed this proposition and of course it did not take place. For what it is
                        worth, it is my opinion, and I believe the opinion of General <persName
                            corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName>, that the Shah would not have
                        been pleased had we followed that plan and that he would not in fact have
                        initialed that paper or any other paper. He was not prepared, in my opinion,
                        to negotiate while in the United States.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Tanks</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In opening the subject of tanks, General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> informed the Shah that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had looked very closely at the
                        question of the desirability of furnishing the M–60 and/or the M–48A3. It
                        was the viewpoint of the Secretary that, taking a variety of factors into
                        account, it would be desirable to furnish M–60's. The indicated price per
                        unit with one year's spares would be $220,000. This would be about $70,000
                        more than the indicated price for an M–48A3. On the other hand, the M–60 is
                        a better piece of equipment. It could be maintained for a longer period of
                        time and it would be better from a supply, maintenance, and operating
                        viewpoint to concentrate on one tank instead of having a combination of
                        M–60's, M–48's and M–47's. In response, the Shah said he was pleased by this
                        decision. He felt it was wise. He said he wanted a tank that was good for
                        eight or ten years, and that the M–60 was best for this purpose. He, too,
                        had been worried about the proliferation of models.</p>
                    <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0114"/>
                    <p>On the subject of the proposed M–41 light tank, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> said that the United States Army
                        had looked at this question very carefully and recommended that the Shah not
                        take M–41's. The General said that there would be a maintenance problem with
                        the tank within several years and that its adoption would again create
                        proliferation problems. He said that the Army felt the Shah would be better
                        advised to use the in-country M–47's for the purpose he had in mind with
                        respect to the M–41 and, if this recommendation were adopted, there would be
                        a net indicated savings for Iran of about $12 million. The Shah again said
                        that this seemed wise to him and he believed that it was the proper course
                        for Iran to pursue.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then raised the subject of armored cars. In reply he was informed
                        that the United States Army recommended he not enter this field. We do not
                        use armored cars in our own Army. There are none produced for United States
                        Government account although both Cadillac and Chrysler produce this
                        equipment for export purposes. It was pointed out that their products are
                        competitive with the products produced by other countries but again to the
                        extent that this type of equipment was needed the requirement could be
                        covered by a judicious use of M–47's. The Shah said he was inclined to
                        accept the recommendation in this respect, but he would wish to review this
                        subject in the course of the Tehran discussions.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Other Equipment</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Shah raised the question of certain other equipment that he had inquired
                        about at the meeting on June 8, such as machine guns, <gloss
                            target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s, and howitzers. He was informed these
                        would be available and details would be provided in Tehran. Furthermore, it
                        is quite possible that these would be supplied under <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> grant. He said he was grateful for this information, and
                        nothing more was said about it.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Air Defense</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Shah asked what information was available in respect to the various
                        elements of the air defense problem that had been discussed at the two
                        earlier meetings in Washington. In reply, the Shah was asked what his
                        reaction had been to his experience in flying the F–5A on the West Coast.
                        The weary Shah brightened up at this point and for a few minutes we
                        maneuvered an F–5A very high in the sky. He said it was a beautiful plane,
                        highly maneuverable, very easy to fly, and with substantially better
                        characteristics than he had understood. He said he was much impressed with
                        the way the Northrop people had dealt with him when he was in their capable
                        hands. He said as a Persian he had certain knowledge of the tactics of
                        salesmanship. In this instance, he honestly felt that they had not
                        overstressed or oversold their case and he greatly appreciated their
                        approach to him. He then asked General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> if he had statistics available on the relative
                        characteristics of the various Russian <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0115"
                        />bombers. The General supplied this information with indications that the
                        F–5A was quite capable of handling these bombers in a combat situation. The
                        General went on to point out frankly that a MIG–21, which has quite high air
                        defense characteristics, was in some respects clearly superior to an F–5A.
                        On the other hand, its very short range would indicate that it could not
                        effectively operate against an F–5A very deeply within the territory of
                        Iran. The Shah appeared impressed by these points. He said that he now felt
                        that he should not plan on utilizing the F–4C. He said the F–4C is a
                        superior airplane; on the other hand, it would be terribly expensive in
                        money terms and again would involve a proliferation of aircraft models and
                        would be hard for his people to handle. He therefore was coming to the
                        conclusion that he ought to plan in the years ahead on replacing his F–86
                        squadrons with F–5A's. He said that he was hopeful that the armament people
                        would be successful in their efforts to produce a better missile for the
                        F–5A, but this of course would remain to be seen. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> said that we noted with
                        satisfaction the Shah's feelings about the F–5A and agreed there would be a
                        very substantial savings in terms of money and men, if he would continue
                        with this fine plane. The Shah said this was his point of view at this
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>He went on to say that the modernization program for all his forces would
                        have to go on. He very much doubted, however, that they would be able to
                        make very much in the way of gains relative to the great strength of their
                        potential enemies from the north. They would of course do their best. On the
                        other hand, he was convinced they had a growing threat from the west. He was
                        confident that Iran, within its resources, could make a positive improvement
                        in its posture in this respect. He was determined to do this. He said that
                        Iran and the United States had made very substantial investments in the
                        Dezful and Hamadan airfields. These are very fine facilities which are of
                        very great importance in a military sense both to Iran and to the United
                        States. At this moment, however, they literally have no defense. It would be
                        a very great pity if nothing were done about this problem and at some future
                        time these facilities were knocked out. He said it was important to
                        establish Hawk facilities at these airfields, and he wished now to obtain
                        American views on the availability of such equipment. In reply he was told
                        that we did have a Hawk battalion which could be made available and that we
                        would be prepared to discuss this in greater detail in the course of the
                        negotiations in Tehran. It was indicated that this particular battalion
                        could be made available at about $21 million. The price of a battalion at a
                        later date would probably be significantly higher. He said he would be
                        interested in obtaining this battalion and that he would contemplate
                        possibly splitting it with two batteries at each airfield. He then asked
                        about the characteristics and potential availability of Nike Hercules. In
                        reply he was told this of course was very good equipment. However, we had
                        not made it <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0116"/>available under <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and it was very doubtful that we would. It
                        is extremely expensive and very difficult to man in an effective sense. He
                        seemed to accept this as a logical and negative reply. He asked if there
                        might be some equipment that could be made available to provide at least a
                        low-level air defense capability for his airfields in the interim before the
                        Hawks were in place, recognizing that this might be three years. He was told
                        there were some twin M–40 “Dusters” available and that they might run about
                        $50,000 a unit. He asked what the status was of the in-country 20 and 40
                        mms. which have been phased out of the Iranian force structure. The General
                        replied that they were in very bad shape, but that it might be possible to
                        find enough of them in usable condition to provide at least a modicum of
                        defense and training equipment for these two airfields. If this were done,
                        the General felt they probably should be turned over to the Iranian Air
                        Force. The Shah thought this was a good idea and requested the General to
                        look into it when he returned to Tehran and to discuss it with him at a
                        later date. This was agreed.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that at some time in the future he felt that Iran would need a
                        second Hawk battalion and he wondered if it might not be possible and
                        feasible to train simultaneously the manpower that would be necessary to
                        handle two battalions instead of just one. He said he was thinking in part
                        about the future need for some air defense about Bandar Abbas. He estimated
                        that the Bandar Abbas port and navy “base” would be completed in about 1968.
                        He also said that he very much hoped that the airfield at Bandar Abbas would
                        be operational before that date. He said he had instructed the Plan
                        Organization, which has the necessary funds, to proceed with this as fast it
                        feasible. In this respect he recalled that he had mentioned the
                        possibilities of pre-positioning American equipment in this area. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> told him that there
                        would of course be considerable strain in the training process in regard to
                        the Hawks and this was something that would have to be discussed at a later
                        date in greater detail. The Shah said he understood this and would look
                        forward to further discussion in Tehran.</p>
                    <p>As a final comment in respect to aviation, the Shah said that he was pleased
                        about the decision in respect to the four C–130's and that he hoped that in
                        the course of negotiations in Tehran decisions could be arrived at in
                        respect to the additional four that would be required to complete their air
                        transport force. He would ultimately wish to replace all his C–47's with
                        twelve C–130's.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Shah inquired if we had been able to accumulate information he had
                        requested in respect to the possible purchase of a DD or a DE. He was told
                        that we felt we could ultimately make available either a DD or a DE in a
                        completely rehabilitated condition. The destroyer probably would be in
                        excess of $3 million and the destroyer escort would be in the vicinity <pb
                            n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0117"/>of $2 million. In each case
                        Congressional authorization would be required for the transfer and it would
                        be unlikely that either could be made available short of two or three years.
                        The Shah said that this was all right because it would take some time for
                        his people to be ready to utilize units like this effectively. He was also
                        told it might be possible to make available a new frigate. This would not
                        require Congressional authorization but the price would be in excess of $4
                        million. While the Shah did not appear to be much interested in the frigate,
                        he did indicate a desire to discuss this matter further in the coming
                        discussions in Tehran.</p>
                    <p>In sum, the Shah was informed that (1) we were prepared to sell him 176
                        M–60's and four C–130's; (2) <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> grant
                        assistance would be continued in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67–69;
                        (3) that we were prepared to begin negotiations in Tehran in one week,
                        although we had doubts about the feasibility of such an early date; (4)
                        these negotiations would cover the modernization requirements of the Iranian
                        forces in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65–69 period; (5) that a
                        Hawk battalion would be available at about $21 million; (6) that his other
                        requirements, such as machine guns, howitzers, and <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                            >APC</gloss>'s, would be provided. He was manifestly pleased.</p>

                        Understanding of September 1962, provided for furnishing certain defense
                        items of materiel and services. Some items were to be furnished in specified
                        quantities, other items were described in general terms, without specifying

                        package was not to exceed $298.6 million, but the Iranians were not informed
                        of this dollar limitation. Deliveries were to be accomplished by 30 June

                        disturbances at Waldorf Astoria or World's Fair. About 15 pickets were near
                        the hotel. Shah and Empress upset by 9 June episode and Foroughi cites it as

                    <p>During Los Angeles visit, pro-Shah demonstrators, evidently organized by
                        official Iranians (Naficy and Kowsar) outnumbered anti-Shah demonstrators at
                        airport and Ambassador Hotel, were overly boisterous in their welcome, and
                        engaged in some fisticuffs with anti-Shah demonstrators; at least one
                        anti-Shah demonstrator arrested but released on bail.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_UCLA1">UCLA</gloss> commencement ceremonies 11 June
                        proceeded with dignity in spite of major attempts to cause disturbances.
                        There were about 75 anti-Shah demonstrators, of which only 12 Iranians,
                        remainder being “other nationalities” (no further information yet
                        available). These were kept on sidelines, some 150 yards away from ceremony,
                        and their shouts did not disturb proceedings. When Shah started to speak, 5
                        students walked out but were not able to create disturbance. When some
                        anti-Shah students attempted to unfurl banner, two were removed bodily by
                        pro-Shah student group, which numbered about 50. During ceremony, hired
                        airplane made two runs toward area carrying streamer reading: “Need a fix?
                        See the Shah” (reference was to heroin addiction). Los Angeles police

                        from area. Shah outraged by reference narcotics addiction but deeply
                        impressed effective police action; at 12 June departure ceremony, he asked
                        to see helicopter pilot and presented him with gift. No info yet available
                        re renters of plane except they said to be “students” and paid $250 for
                        rental.</p>
                    <p>Los Angeles press publicity, while predictably sensational (referring to
                        “dogfight” in air over <gloss target="#t_UCLA1">UCLA</gloss>, stressing
                        Empress's extravagant shopping sprees) probably not, in sum,
                        detrimental.</p>
                    <p>On balance, it appears from info presently available that Shah, though upset
                        with New York picketing and L.A. plane episode, does not hold <gloss

                        <hi rend="italic">Iran Problem</hi>. Though 5-year $300 million Iran <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> plan (a real break-through) still has three
                        years to run (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63–67), Shah recently got
                        all fired up about buying some fancy new hardware. He alleges growing Arab
                        threat to oil-rich Khuzistan, but more likely his rapidly growing oil
                        revenues have gone to his head (he told <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss>
                        he expected $1.2 billion annually by 1970—he gets $400 plus million
                        now).</p>
                    <p>We're happy to sell for hard currency, since otherwise Shah will simply buy
                        elsewhere. However: (a) chief threat to Iran's stability is still internal,
                        not external—so nation-building remains the basic need; (b) since Iran is
                        oil-rich, we want to phase out <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> money and
                        let it finance its development through oil revenues; (c) ergo, we want to
                        limit Shah's overall military outlays to reasonable figure, using <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> credit sales plus some continued <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> as the lever.</p>
                    <p>So we've cooked up a so-called Cooperative Logistics Agreement under which
                        we: (a) promise Shah good credit terms for some $250 million in sales of
                        M–60's, C–130s, F–5s, etc. during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65–69;
                        (b) as a sweetner promise to continue a <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        grant program through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 ($53 million
                        beyond present agreement); (c) want in return a promise that Iran will
                        restrict its own military outlays to what we think reasonable so that
                        development program is not short-changed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is pushing hard for closing
                        this deal immediately, saying he's discussed it with <gloss target="#t_LBJ1"
                            >LBJ</gloss>. One story is that <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> told
                        him either to sell $1.5 billion a year in hard goods to balance our payments
                        or to cut troops in Germany. Bob pressed <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                            >Bell</persName> and Alex Johnson last week.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the cause, Bob has panicked his people, and seems to be listening
                        only to his salesmen, not to politico-military types. For example, he
                        reversed his OK to Sloan to steer Shah to M–48A3 (our Israeli ploy) and
                        plugged M–60s. This will cause havoc with Turks, Paks and others, who will
                        now want M–60s and can't pay for them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and I can't see cause for rushing in so
                        fast (Shah is quite happy with promises of M–60s and C–130s he got here).
                        But above all we think this military carrot (to which we've no objection)
                        should be used to get an agreed ceiling on Iran's overall hard currency
                        military outlays, so Iran's <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>future
                        isn't jeopardized to satisfy Shah's military whims. Embassy Teheran says
                        Shah wouldn't like any attempt to impose ceiling (Teheran 1188)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d45fn2">Dated June 23. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF

                        provision for annual reviews of Iran military program, upon which each
                        year's <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and sales increment would be
                        contingent. But I don't trust Embassy or <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        here, and would prefer a real stab at an agreed ceiling, a la the successful
                        Indian exercise we just went through. At least let's make a try for an
                        agreed ceiling, before retreating to annual reviews as a fallback.</p>
                    <p>We still have control of this, because a 1550 Determination is needed. I'm
                        sure <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> will agree with us, and probably
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> too. So I hope we won't let Rapid
                        Robert's passion for promptitude panic us into premature pusillanimity.

                    <p>We have reached a compromise on our new 5-year <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> agreement with Iran. RWK has dropped his idea of writing a

                        an annual US-Iranian review of the effect of arms purchases on the economy
                        would give us better <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/>control. They
                        say they'd even be willing to shut off credit altogether if the Shah goes

                                June 1964, between His Imperial Majesty, the Shah of Iran, and the
                                President of the United States of America and other officials of the

                    </p>
                    <p>II. In the light of these considerations, the two Governments reaffirm the
                        concept for the defense of Iran and the force structure for the Imperial
                        Iranian Armed Forces set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding of
                        September 19, 1962. The Governments also restate their commitments to carry
                        out their respective obligations undertaken in the Memorandum. In
                        particular, the United States Government will, subject to the availability
                        of funds and continued Congressional authorization, deliver on a grant basis
                        the remaining equipment, material and services specified in the 1962
                        Memorandum. The Imperial Government of Iran will make satisfactory provision
                        for the effective utilization and operation of all equipment provided to and
                        within its military forces and will limit its purchases of military
                        equipment to the requirements of agreed attainable force objectives. The
                        Imperial Government also undertakes to assure that its program of military
                        purchases will not cause undue strain on the nation's foreign exchange
                        reserves or jeopardize plans for the nation's economic and social
                        development.</p>
                    <p>III. In view of the improved financial situation of Iran and the need for
                        modernizing Iran's military forces on long-range basis, the two Governments
                        agree to an additional program of Mutual Defense Cooperation for the period

                        Governments in the Memorandum of Understanding of September 19, 1962.</p>

                        development program. This will include a joint assessment of the effect of

                        relationship to fundamental security of his country as expressed by the late
                        President Kennedy and President Johnson. Since we would not wish economic

                        effects of military modernization program must be kept in proper bounds. In

                    <p>9. Memo of Understanding without change signed today by me and by Minister of
                        Court “by command of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Iran”. At same time
                        Minister of Court, again by command of the Shah, transmitted a letter which
                        appoints General Hedjazi as the Iranian rep provided for in para IV of the
                        Memo of Understanding. In this same letter it is stated that “In future
                        requirements of the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces will be communicated by
                        General Hedjazi, in accordance with para IV of the memo”. Original signed
                        copy of Memo of Understanding and this letter being forwarded by pouch.</p>
                    <p>Shah said that he recognized the proposed program involving $200 million
                        credit and $50 million cash was the most that should be spent on military
                        modernization under presently anticipated revenues and foreign exchange
                        availability. However, he wishes to be free to bring up possibility of
                        purchasing additional equipment, which he considers desirable, if increased
                        revenues over and above those now anticipated should accrue to the Iranian
                        Govt in such amount as to make it feasible to acquire additional equipment
                        without jeopardizing national economic and social programs. The Shah made a
                        very strong statement that he would not allow military expenditures
                        adversely to affect Iran's economic progress. However, he has high hopes
                        that oil revenues, and hence foreign exchange availability, will increase to
                        a greater extent than presently foreseen. The additional equipment which
                        might eventually be acquired would be: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>Gen <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> considers that the
                        problem of training sufficient Iranian military personnel to man new fighter
                        aircraft, first Hawk battalion and AC and W system will act effectively to
                        defer introduction of this additional equipment prior to 1969. He emphasized
                        this personnel problem very strongly to Shah.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the foregoing, the Shah wanted to go on record as pointing out
                        that modernization might require some slight upward revision of troop
                        ceilings, although he insisted he had no intention of espousing <pb n="100"
                            xml:id="pg_100" facs="0128"/>any substantial expansion. He wanted to
                        adhere to the order of magniture of the present force objectives, but, on
                        the other hand, he did not want to be held rigidly to 160,000. A preliminary
                        estimate indicates that any increase required by modernization will not
                        likely exceed the ceiling of 162,000 set in the instructions for the
                        agreement of 1962.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that he agreed with Gen <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> that the idea of acquiring destroyers and torpedo
                        boats should be abandoned and said that he would like to add to the program
                        two patrol frigates modified to carry torpedoes. Gen <persName
                            corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> believes that there is enough
                        margin in Annexes A and B to permit this. This addition will be discussed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName>-Hedjazi.</p>

                    <p>The Shah expressed himself as being entirely satisfied and pleased with these
                        new arrangements.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: In order that reports of this series may be
                        considered also in connection with the Department's review of our
                        forthcoming Progress Report on the Internal Defense Plan, we have used
                        August 1 as the vantage point from which to survey the political situation
                        in Iran. Therefore, <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>insofar as the
                        present report also contains a semi-annual review of events, it covers the
                        seven-month period from January 1 to August 1. Unless a faster pace of
                        events makes another cut-off date appear more useful for such an assessment,
                        we hope to furnish the next report in this series six months from now, on
                        February 1, 1965.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The only important trend that emerges from
                        our assessment is the gradual deterioration of Iran-Arab relations, and
                        especially of relations with Iraq, since the time of our last report in this
                        series. This is now clearly the problem of principal concern to the Shah.
                        Relations with the U.S. are excellent, probably in good part due to our
                        forthcoming attitude toward the Shah's military concerns, which are now
                        primarily related to the Arab claims to Khuzistan. The internal security
                        situation is good, and the regime's control as tight as ever. The economic
                        situation is on balance slightly worse because of the poor crop situation,
                        although business activity is up; but private investment has not revived and
                        real wages for urban workers are probably down.</p>
                    <p>The Mansur Government appears to be a definite improvement over its
                        predecessor, both in respect to the leadership provided by the Prime
                        Minister and in respect to substantive administrative improvements. The
                        Parliament has not increased in political importance. The reform program has
                        made no particular progress. The New Iran Party is displaying some forward
                        movement and seems to become an asset to the regime. The opposition's
                        capacity for making trouble has probably further declined, and this is also
                        true of the mullahs. Some minor changes have occurred in the “pecking
                        order“, but the Shah of course still determines everyone's status. The
                        tribal situation is definitely better in the south, and under control in the
                        west. The slow trend “normalization” of relations with the <gloss

                    <p>It now appears that <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Ayatollah
                        Khomeini</persName>'s speech of September 9 (NIT–6533)<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d51fn3">Not printed.</note> did not include any statement
                        supporting the Mansur Government. The only relatively positive feature of
                        the speech is that, while it criticizes the Iranian regime on numerous
                        counts, it does so somewhat less violently than usual for this dissident
                        clerical leader.</p>
                    <p>According to more reliable information [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>], the September 9 speech blamed “world
                        colonialism” for the divisions between Shia and Sunni, and “the West” for
                        differences between Iranians and Arabs and other Moslems. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> termed the <gloss target="#t_RCD1"
                            >RCD</gloss> a specific instance of such foreign-inspired division among
                        Moslems (although he did not cite the <gloss target="#t_RCD1">RCD</gloss> by
                        name). He inveighed against Israeli and Jewish influence in Iran, complained
                        against lack of freedom of public expression for the religious leaders, and
                        took an oblique swipe at the New Iran Party. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>]/3/</p>
                    <p>On the whole, qualified observers feel that even though <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> continues to remonstrate against
                        the regime and its policies, there has been a slight toning-down in his
                        position. <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss> believes the religious
                        situation does not for the moment constitute a serious problem for the
                        security authorities.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that a judicious mix of bribery, conciliatory tactics and the
                        ever-present threat of the regime's mailed fist, has had the effect of
                        lessening somewhat the virulence of <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName>'s opposition—although, as his latest speech is now
                        more reliably reported, he is very far indeed from calling for support of
                        the government.</p>

                        by vote 74 to 61. Disappointingly, slim margin was due to number of factors
                        as analyzed below, but what stands out is that New Iran Party leadership
                        lost control over substantial number of its own followers.</p>
                    <p>There are presently 188 deputies in Majlis, of which 138 are New Iran Party
                        members. Some 50 New Iran Party deputies seem to have been absent, and of
                        those present we estimate at least 12 must have voted against government.
                        This became easier for them when opposition was successful in forcing secret
                        vote, which is highly unusual but can be obtained under Majlis regulations
                        if 15 deputies ask for it.</p>
                    <p>Sequence of events and factors entering into the vote were as follows: 1.
                        Monday's New Iran Party caucus (reftel) seemingly went so well that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>, Yeganeh and Ziai decided
                        to speed up schedule and bring both bills to vote Tuesday. That party
                        leadership was obviously over-confident is shown by fact that majority made
                        no special effort to round up its supporters to secure maximum attendance.
                        (It is difficult to know how many absented themselves deliberately, but
                        certainly not all absent New Iran Party deputies were busy elsewhere.)
                        Mardom and Independents, who make up “opposition“, were practically all
                        present.</p>
                    <p>2. From beginning of debate, PriMin was on the defensive. While Majlis
                        contacts say they admired his composure under fire, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> apparently thought he was dealing
                        only with usual “opposition” which could be steamrollered by New Iran Party
                        majority. Fact that government was abandoned by some of its own supporters
                        (either by adverse vote or deliberate absence) came as rude shock after
                        outcome of vote was announced. Before the vote Ziai had told us New Iran
                        Party expected only two or three defections.</p>
                    <p>3. Government made long and comprehensive statement about purport of bill,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> offered repeated
                        interpretations in course of <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0132"
                        />debate. Since these may constitute important legislative history, we will
                        submit separate analysis as soon as full record of debate available.
                        Apparently government was forthright in explaining scope and status of bill
                        and did not hedge in its explanations.</p>
                    <p>4. Opposition either did not get the word that Shah wanted status bill
                        passed, or else it had license to attack government. In any case Mardom and
                        Independents pulled out all the stops, especially after they were voted down
                        in succession of procedural maneuvers designed to delay vote. Government
                        apparently felt (erroneously) that if opposition did not want bill to be
                        brought to vote, it must be weak.</p>
                    <p>5. What did not help at all is that yesterday's press reported automobile
                        accident in Tehran in which a US serviceman gravely injured an Iranian taxi
                        driver. Some speakers claimed that status bill would wipe out civil
                        liability in such cases. Among the more scurrilous arguments heard was that,
                        “if status bill was passed, an American non-com could henceforth slap the
                        face of an Iranian General with impunity.” Most violent speakers against
                        status bill were deputies Zahtab-Fard and Sartip-Pur. Both independents; but
                        many others also talked against, including Mardom group leader Rambod.</p>
                    <p>6. With Majlis Speaker Riazi in the US, presiding officer was Shafi-Amin who
                        is unskilled in parliamentary tactics and was weak in controlling debate.
                        (Senate President Sharif-Emami, a seasoned parliamentary strategist,
                        commented to us last night that in similar situation he would have called
                        secret session to “blow off steam” before permitting debate to proceed on
                        the record.)</p>
                    <p>7. There were clearly anti-American themes employed by some of opposition
                        speakers, some of them quite ridiculous (such as insinuation that PriMin
                        must be an American puppet because he had once rented a house to U.S.
                        Embassy officer who was alleged to be “running the government”). Government
                        seems to have suffered this in silence. There were no enthusiastic
                        supporters of status bill. All the emotion was on the other side.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we find that while it is heartening that long drawnout
                        question of status of US military personnel in Iran is now settled in
                        parliament, not only <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> but to
                        some extent also the Shah's regime has paid an unexpectedly high price in
                        getting this done. That price was due in large measure to ineptitude of
                        government's handling both in upper and lower house, but it would be idle to
                        minimize the Nationalist reaction which passage of the bill called forth. It
                        will take several days to assess whether this is a temporary phenomenon that
                        will blow over, as now seems likely, or whether it will have some
                        longer-lasting effects on our relations with Iran.</p>

                            >PL</gloss>-480 programs for Iran has raised so many troublesome
                        problems that we suggest you schedule a meeting with Mr. <persName>Raymond
                            A. Ioanes</persName>, Administrator of the Foreign Agriculture Service,
                        to try to reach a meeting of minds on a government-wide approach that would
                        serve both our foreign policy and our commercial interests. At such a
                        meeting you might describe the progress being made in Iran toward efficient
                        economic management and stress the importance of promptness and
                        understanding in our dealings with an important transitional country such as
                        Iran. The following points might be made at such a meeting: <list>

                                Iran has made such progress in financial management in recent years
                                that we are able gradually to shift our major concern from aid
                                projects to market development. We have made a number of policy
                                changes in the past year to take advantage of growing Iranian
                                financial strength for the benefit of the U.S. balance of payments,
                                including: raising the interest rate on <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                    >AID</gloss> development loans and gradually replacing such
                                loans by <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> lending at commercial
                                rates; shifting our military assistance from an all-grant basis to a
                                combined grant and credit-sales basis; greatly increasing the
                                U.S.-use component of our most recent <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                    >PL</gloss>-480 Title I agreement (from 35% to 60%, including
                                Cooley loans); and informing the Iranians that further <gloss
                                    target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 agreements after that of
                                September 29 would be under Title IV (dollar credit sales) rather
                                than Title I. In fact, we may have been overdoing things and making
                                too many changes that impinge on the Iranian balance of payments,
                                which has recently begun to show some unexpected signs of strain.
                                But on balance, we feel that Iran will continue to gain in financial
                                strength over the long term and will offer a growing market for our
                                exports, provided we make the appropriate adjustments <pb n="106"
                                    xml:id="pg_106" facs="0134"/>in our policies and procedures. As
                                regards agricultural commodities in particular, the rising living
                                standards and the current land reform efforts would seem to portend
                                shortfalls for a number of years in marketable surpluses from
                                domestic production. These opportunities not only offer potential
                                commercial advantages, they also provide what may turn out to be one
                                of our chief means of maintaining U.S. influence in this
                                strategically located country.</item>

                                thus behooves us to manage our new style of financial-commercial
                                relationship with Iran with care. We expect—and to an increasing
                                degree are receiving—more efficient and business-like response from
                                the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in our commercial/financial
                                relationships. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, in turn,
                                expects equally business-like and prompt responses from us. During
                                recent months we have encountered hard bargaining in regard to loan
                                terms, and it has been made clear to us that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is in a position and has the
                                negotiating skill to be quite discriminating, for instance, in the
                                choice of foreign suppliers for capital equipment needed in its
                                sizeable development program. So far our <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                    >PL</gloss>-480 terms have remained sufficiently concessionary
                                that we have not had to worry about foreign competition in
                                agricultural commodities, although the Iranians have been frustrated
                                by what appears to them as excessive bureaucratic delay.</item>

                                <hi rend="italic">Current Title I Wheat Program</hi>. This is a good
                                case in point. The Iranians officially requested, on June 29, 1964,
                                an amendment to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1964 Title I
                                wheat agreement (for 80,000 tons) raising the amount to 240,000 tons
                                because of an emergency situation created by an unexpected crop
                                failure. The amendment route was preferred in the interests of
                                speed, because the GOI, facing wheat shortages in parts of the
                                country where land had been distributed to former tenants, felt
                                under political pressure to ensure adequate wheat supplies in the
                                countryside as well as in the cities. A new <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                    >PL</gloss>-480 agreement (the amendment route was vetoed) was
                                not signed until September 29, the amount was reduced to 140,000
                                tons (to allow for Title IV private entity transactions and some
                                increase in usual marketings), and the terms were hardened in many
                                respects. As of the present PA's are being issued for 70,000 tons,
                                whereas the Iranians have been pressing continually for issuance of
                                the full amount. As the Iranians see it, their urgent request for
                                wheat, hopefully to be delivered early in the Fall of 1964, has been
                                whittled down and dangerously delayed. None of the explanations we
                                are able to make about the reasons for these actions is very useful
                                in allaying their irritation and feeling that we have let them down.
                                We think the U.S. Government could have acted much more promptly and
                                responsively if all parties concerned had shared the same
                                appreciation of the urgency of the Iranian request and the policy
                                advantages for the U.S. in responding promptly.</item>

                        approved bill authorizing $200 million <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                        >USG</gloss>-guaranteed credit from US banks for purchase military
                        equipment. Majlis approval was unanimous following Prime Minister's briefing
                        in closed session and strong statement in open session. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> sent to Senate for its “observations”
                        (under Article 46 of constitution Majlis has final word on money bills),
                        after which it returns for second reading.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister's statement advocating passage of credit bill for improving
                        Iranian military posture referred emphatically [to] the “threats against
                        Iran's interests in the Persian Gulf.” This was clear reference, as one
                        paper put it, “the claims to Khuzistan Province by Arab radio stations and
                        newspapers linked the regime of Nasser.” Mansur made it clear that <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> regards developments in Middle East as
                        currently posing greatest threat. In contrast, in referring to recent
                        changes in Soviet Union he reportedly described U.S.S.R. as “our northern
                        neighbor which has for years adopted a policy of peaceful coexistence” and
                        expressed hope that “political, economic and cultural ties would continue to
                        grow strong.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> also expressed appreciation
                        for U.S. aid since World War II and claimed that credit commitments would
                        not detract from development needs and that defense expenditures being kept
                        at lowest possible levels. With reference to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> allies he said that “there have not been and will not be
                        any changes in the policies of our <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        allies.”</p>

                    <p>All major press editorials dealt with subject of credit bill and all follow
                        explicit or implicit anti-Nasser line. For example, English-language Tehran
                        journal headlined “Nasser Forces Military Loan” and made passing reference
                        to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> “Russian-equipped soldiers.”</p>
                    <p>We understand that deputies who had talked against govt during recent status
                        bill debate went out of their way this time to compliment govt for its
                        handling of country's defense needs. Word has been passed down last week
                        that Shah wanted credit bill passed by Oct 26, and no nonsense.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d54fn3">Airgram A–303 from Tehran, December 15, reported that
                            the “coincidence” of having the parliamentary vote on the status of
                            forces bill followed within 2 weeks by the unanimous vote to accept a
                            $200 million credit from U.S. commercial banks for the purchase of U.S.
                            military equipment had contributed to the widespread belief that in some
                            way the passage of the status bill was the price exacted by the United
                            States for the granting of the credits in question. (Ibid., DEF 15–3

                            31.3</note> for the first time gave public explanations regarding

                            >Bill</persName>. Speech was prominently featured by press, rebroadcast
                        over the radio, and has perceptibly improved public climate surrounding the
                        status question.</p>
                    <p>As <hi rend="italic">Kayhan International</hi> put it, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>'s speech “in effect made amends for
                        government's handling of the bill, as far as public was concerned. The
                        administration's hush-hush line had provided fuel for flickering <pb n="109"
                            xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"/>embers of whatever opposition there is in
                        the country. That fire at one moment threatened to spread, with opposition
                        apparently out to exploit what they thought to be government's Achilles
                        heel. And because exact terms of the bill were not known, and it was not
                        possible to determine the extent of immunity granted, the critics, working
                        from their pulpit sanctuaries or fifth column hideouts, spread the lie that
                        very independence and sovereignty of Iran were being bartered.”</p>
                    <p>Among Deputies and Senators, there is rejoicing that the air has been cleared
                        by <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>'s statement.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, however. PriMin's speech contained not only helpful statements
                        but also number of glaring inaccuracies which look good to the public but
                        apparently involved serious misrepresentation of the bill's coverage. In
                        particular, he was reported to have said three things which are wrong: (1)
                        that, whereas the U.S. had asked dependents to be covered, they are excluded
                        from coverage by the wording of the law; (2) that only on-duty offenses are
                        covered by immunity, apparently without distinction between civil and
                        criminal offenses; and (3) that, although the US had asked all members of
                        advisory missions to be covered, the law actually covers only those who
                        fulfill technical advisory functions.</p>
                    <p>Ziai, Chairman of Majlis Foreign Affairs Committee, acknowledged to us Sunday
                        that these statements correspond neither to the law nor, in particular, to
                        the legislative history. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> told us
                        privately on the same day that he was aware <persName corresp="#p_MHA1"
                            >Mansur</persName> had said things that were not true; but we could not
                        rely on Aram to set things right.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I sought urgent interview with <persName corresp="#p_MHA1"
                            >Mansur</persName> yesterday and, while congratulating him on the
                        popular success he had scored with his speech, asked him how we are to
                        report certain apparent mistakes which might be due to misquotation by the
                        press but which could cause future trouble. He backed down all along the
                        way. Regarding families, he said he might have used the wrong word but had
                        meant to refer to members of household who are not members of family. (I
                        believe he really had believed that members of the family were not covered,
                        but realized his error when I pointed out to him the relevant provision of
                        the convention. It is also possible that others beforehand had alerted him
                        to his mistake. He subsequently phoned to say he was arranging to have
                        official record of his remarks amended to make clear he was referring to
                        non-American members of household.) As for on-duty or off-duty distinction,
                        he had clearly said, he claimed, that this applies only to civil liability.
                        And as for coverage of members of advisory missions, he had only meant to
                        say that Iranian employees of those missions cannot enjoy immunities.</p>
                    <p>I then asked what he intended to do to rectify the erroneous public
                        impression which his remarks had created, adding that I had refused to
                        answer press queries as to whether Embassy agreed with PriMin until I had
                        chance to talk with him. His reply was instantaneous: by no means <pb
                            n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0138"/>must there be further public
                        discussion of this matter. Mistakes could be corrected by amending the
                        record. He did not even wish the Foreign Ministry to be brought into the
                        matter for time being. PriMin said he had certain difficulties due to fact
                        that Vienna Convention had inadvertently been submitted to Majlis minus one
                        article. When this and other elements of the record had been tidied up,
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would formally notify Embassy that
                        law applying provisions of Vienna Convention to members U.S. Military
                        Advisory Mission was in effect. The full provisions of the convention would
                        apply. I said I was glad to hear this, as both U.S. and Iran had suffered
                        from this long drawn-out process, and we must make certain that the goal we
                        have both been seeking is fully achieved. Furthermore, when General
                            <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> had recently discussed
                        matter with Shah, latter had given no indication at all that he had in mind
                        anything but the full application of the provisions of the convention to the
                        US Military Advisory Missions.</p>
                    <p>This incident clearly demonstrates importance that must be attached to early
                        formal clarification of the coverage obtained through the status bill, and
                        notably the continued validity of our original exchange of notes. It also
                        shows timeliness of our recommendation in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                            >Embtel</gloss> 495, which involves some sweetening of pill to obtain
                        the desired result. If the Foreign Ministry balks at providing the necessary
                        languages we must hold the Prime Minister to his word and if necessary go
                        the Shah. We have been fighting too long to achieve this coverage for our
                        military people, and received too much in the way of unfavorable public
                        repercussions, largely as a result of the ineptitude of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in handling this matter. To risk losing our
                        full goal at this stage of the game owing to lack of precision or effort by
                        some Iranian officials to engage in back-tracking maneuvers.</p>

                            xml:id="d57fn2">Telegram 359 to Tehran, October 27, instructed the
                            Embassy to inform the Foreign Ministry that Khaibar Gudarzian had
                            obtained a New York court default judgment against Prince Mahmud Reza
                            for an amount in excess of $1 million, based on Gudarzian's claim that
                            the Prince had given a check for this amount to the World Sport
                            Federation, which was not honored upon presentation. Court records
                            indicated that the Prince had been personally served with papers at
                            Kennedy Airport in New York on August 8, 1963, and had so far presented
                            no defense. Thus, the court was prepared to issue a default judgment
                            against the Prince's Morgan Guaranty Bank account unless he took some
                            effective legal action without delay. (Ibid.)</note> ForMinister spoke
                        to me at some length yesterday about Prince Mahmud Reza's difficulties with
                        Gudarzian. He said Shah and Prince are incensed about this matter and cannot
                        understand how things could have developed to point that Prince's account
                        was about to be sequestered, obviously on basis falsified documents since no
                        check given Gudarzian and Prince not in US at time papers allegedly served
                        upon him, and furthermore how this could have been going on without Prince
                        knowing anything about it until very last moment. <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> said did not see how this kind of development could

                        Princess Fatimeh withdraw any funds she might have in US banks lest these be

                        didn't think she had any deposited in U.S.)</p>
                    <p>At same time <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> showed me article
                        from New York Daily News of Oct. 29 reporting this whole matter in manner
                        highly unfavorable to Royal Family here, which he said had angered Shah very
                        much. He added both Shah and he convinced that such article would not have
                        appeared, and Gudarzian would not have undertaken this legal action, had
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> taken steps to warn Gudarzian of
                        consequences of any further activity against good relations between Iran and
                        US. After it had been so clearly shown that Gudarzian's assertions to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJL1">McClellan</persName> Committee were nothing
                        but falsehoods, why had <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> done nothing to
                        prevent Gudarzian from taking further action based on same falsehoods, or at
                        least to make sure that his moves were ineffective?</p>
                    <p>How did it happen that bank had so easily disclosed amount of Prince's
                        account? Shah and <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> were at loss
                        understand how a crook like Gudarzian should be able get away with all this,
                        apparently so easily. He was even reported as having said that some people
                        in State <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> were not displeased that he
                        was embarrassing Iranian Royal Family. All this having very unfortunate
                        effect on Shah, said <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I made usual points that a Chief of State should not permit himself be
                        disturbed by attacks of man like this, since such developments are part of
                        penalties of being in public life; US political and legal system
                        unfortunately offers opportunities for abuse; courts must take cognizance of
                        complaints brought before them and cannot evaluate substance until these
                        heard; I understood steps to deport Gudarzian underway and perhaps he
                        seeking delay deportation by undertaking new legal action; as <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> knew, <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                            >Dept</gloss> had offered provide Prince's lawyer with info concerning
                        Gudarzian's past record. It was clear from <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName>'s reception of all this that it did not impress him and
                        that he did not believe it would impress Shah.</p>
                    <p>I do not myself understand how Gudarzian was able to get so far with the New
                        York Court, assuming truth of Prince's statement that he not in US at time
                        papers reportedly served upon him. I would welcome any info <gloss
                            target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> can send me which may be helpful in
                        counteracting highly unfavorable impression this matter has created here.
                        Could not <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> take stronger action to warn
                        Iranian troublemakers of this kind against <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113"

                        army battalion sent to Qom as precautionary measure. Security authorities do
                        not expect any serious trouble.</p>
                    <p>Although <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had watched <persName

                        confinement last spring, it probably would have continued to tolerate his
                        speeches and leaflets as long as his political comments avoided outright
                        subversion. However, his reported call for govt overthrow and related
                        attempt suborn armed forces was straw that broke camel's back.</p>
                    <p>What is unusual is relative moderation of punishment (exile) when considering
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> action against persons committing
                        similar offenses in past. Nevertheless, since govt has not really explained
                        why he was exiled, widespread impression undoubtedly exists that it was only
                        because of his criticism of Status <persName corresp="#p_MBD1"
                            >Bill</persName> and $200 million US loan. This is unfortunate <pb

                        between govt and opposition, in which privileges for US military personnel
                        have been seized upon as issue on which govt is most vulnerable.</p>
                    <p>Govt is now making concerted effort to link <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName> with foreign enemies. After PriMin's reference to
                        “fifth columnists” making trouble over the Status <persName
                            corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> (in his Senate speech last Saturday),
                        press is now rather more explicitly linking <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName> and Nasser. Thus New Iran Party newspaper in
                        connection with <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> exile says
                        “enemies of Iran casting covetous eyes on Khuzistan and the Persian Gulf are
                        trying to disturb the peace in Iran through their paid agents and
                        hirelings.” Ajang recalls that last year <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName>'s statements were broadcast over Radio Cairo. Paper
                        even accuses <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> of having
                        joined in the call to apply the name Arabian Gulf to the Persian Gulf. Poste
                        Tehran says <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> was prepared to
                        give Iranian oil to Nasser.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Peter:</p>
                    <p>The Country Team in Iran has requested us to clarify for the Department of
                        Defense the possibility of using P.L. 480, Title I, 104(c) funds to finance
                        the local currency costs of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> projects in
                        Iran. The recent Title I agreements with Iran provide that the proceeds be
                        used for loans to support <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>Iran's
                        economic development. No provision has been made to extend grants for
                        defense purposes. Moreover, because of Iran's long term favorable balance of
                        payments position, it is unlikely that further Title I agreements will be
                        concluded. In the future, sales of surplus commodities to Iran will be for
                        dollars under Title IV and not for local currency. In summary, there are no
                        funds available for military purposes under present agreements and future
                        availability is highly improbable.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Defense will also recall that in the Spring of 1962, the
                        Shah was informed of the United States decision to terminate budgetary
                        support for the Iranian defense establishment. An allocation of P.L. 480
                        local currency proceeds for defense purposes would represent another form of
                        budgetary support and a reversal of policy which, in our judgment, would not
                        be warranted in view of Iran's improved economic position.<note n="2"

                    <p>For over two years the Shah has been trying to effect fundamental economic
                        and political reforms in Iran, with the primary aim of building a broad
                        popular base for his regime. The most dramatic changes are occurring <pb
                            n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>in the traditional system of land
                        tenure, as villages are taken from individual owners and distributed among
                        the peasants. The program, as expected, is alienating the Shah's supporters
                        among the wealthy classes, whose influence in the country's administration
                        has not lessened significantly. Moreover, the Shah has not yet achieved his
                        desired mass political support; peasants still lack effective instruments to
                        register their approval of his program, and the urban population is
                        skeptical of his motives. Disruptions brought on by the reforms meanwhile
                        threaten an economic crisis and a possible reversal of what he terms his
                        “White Revolution.”</p>

                                on December 11 entered an action in the New York courts charging
                                that an Iranian lawyer, Khosro Eghbal, came to this country to
                                remove assets of Princess Fatemeh and was served with a summons

                                that Iranian immunity in this country has been breached by the
                                court's action in entertaining a charge against his Ambassador. This
                                court action was publicized in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                                    Times</hi> of December 12 and is described further in Tehran's
                                telegram 666, (Tab E) and in the Department's telegram 505, (Tab
                                F).</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy interests in this problem are substantial. The Shah has
                        just rammed through the Iranian Parliament, at our insistence and with
                        considerable risk to his domestic position, a highly unpopular measure
                        extending immunities and privileges to American military personnel in Iran.
                        He has also responded in very forthcoming manner so far to our suggestions
                        that he take a hand in the affair of Robert Bredin, an American engineer who
                        has been sentenced by an Iranian court to three years for the presumed
                        murder of his wife, in the face of evidence clearly indicating death from
                        other causes. We have ahead of us some possibly delicate representations on
                        the subject of a new oil agreement with the Consortium, negotiations for
                        which are now deadlocked. We will also shortly be wanting to raise the
                        subject of Iran's participation in the supply of military units and
                        equipment to South Viet Nam. We must anticipate difficulties in these
                        endeavors and in all other aspects of our relations so long as the Shah can
                        feel that he has been obliging in meeting all of our requests whereas we do
                        not lift a finger to keep his family from being harassed unjustly in our
                        courts or his Ambassador from being falsely accused, all by one he considers
                        a proven scoundrel whom we do not even expose through publicity
                        channels.</p>
                    <p>We have, of course, been for months taking measures designed to curb
                        Gudarzian's activities within the limits of our relationship to a state
                        court system. These were described to <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> in some detail by the Department's Deputy Legal Adviser
                        on December 10, as covered in the Department's telegram 486, (Tab G). When
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Foroughi</persName> called on me on
                        December 18 to deliver a note of protest about the latest court action <pb
                            n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0147"/>and the entire Gudarzian affair
                        (Tab H), Len Meeker and I assured him in strongest terms of this
                        Government's distress over the affair and our determination at high levels
                        to bring Gudarzian to justice. We also persuaded <persName corresp="#p_FM1"
                            >Foroughi</persName> to help us in dispelling the false notion in Tehran
                        that he had actually been served with a subpoena and that Iranian diplomatic
                        immunity here had thereby been breached. I am entertaining <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> at a small luncheon on December 21 and
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> is scheduled to
                        lunch privately with <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> on December
                        22. While these meetings will provide further opportunity for expressions of
                        concern and determination, I am certain that nothing less than a direct
                        expression of this kind from you to <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> will suffice to begin repairing the damage.</p>
                    <p>At a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>, you could
                        explain to him that you found, upon looking into the matter after your
                        December 5 meeting, that the Gudarzian affair had been occupying a great
                        deal of attention in various Government Departments for some months. Most
                        recently these included further detailed contacts by Federal Government
                        officials with New York State legal officials.</p>
                    <p>You could tell <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> that we too are
                        outraged by the latest court action and are determined to take every measure
                        within our power to put a stop to this evident abuse of our state courts by
                        bringing the evidence of possible violations of law forcefully to the
                        attention of the proper authorities. If you agree to send the letters to the
                        Governor of New York, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Acting Attorney
                        General which are attached as Tabs A, B and C respectively, you could cite
                        these as evidence of our determination to see this matter through. (I do not
                        recommend that you give him copies.) You could also tell <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> that we expect developments in the near
                        future to result in press coverage that will help counteract the
                        embarrassment caused to the royal family and to Ambassador <persName

                        oil agreement with the Iranian Oil Consortium. He will very likely request
                        United States Government intercession with American companies participating
                        in the Consortium to modify certain terms of the offer.</p>
                    <p>When Iranian officials approached us, here and in Tehran, during the past
                        month to use our influence with the American companies, we have reminded
                        them that our influence is not sufficient to force the companies to abandon
                        a position which they consider important in their operations abroad. While
                        this remains true, our present difficulties with the Shah over the Gudarzian
                        affair would suggest a somewhat more forthcoming approach to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> on this occasion. I recommend that,
                        while reminding him again of the limits of our influence, you offer the
                        Department's services in contacting American companies, advising them in
                        detail of the Iranian position, and reporting back to the Iranian officials
                        on the results of these approaches.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The proposed agreement, which has been offered by the operating companies to
                        all of the Middle Eastern producing countries participating in <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
                        Countries), involves an agreement to treat royalty payments as an item of
                        operating expenses rather than as part of the country's 50 percent share of
                        profits. This would net the producing countries substantially higher
                        revenues. The companies agreed to make the offer retroactive for the
                        calendar year 1964 if the producing countries would accept it by December
                        31, 1964. This deadline <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0149"/>has now
                        been extended to January 26, 1965. As of December 31, the offer had been
                        accepted by Saudi Arabia, in principle, and by Kuwait, subject to
                        parliamentary ratification.</p>
                    <p>On December 31 Iran finally accepted the fiscal provisions of the offer, but
                        it is still balking at other conditions, namely those involving a quit-claim
                        and arbitration procedures. The Consortium wants a quit-claim (waiver) of
                        all additional monetary demands by Iran for the years preceding the new
                        agreement, whereas Iran wants such a waiver limited to questions involving
                        the level of posted prices. As regards arbitration, Iran contends that the
                        current proposal provides the Consortium with a unilateral right to demand
                        arbitration in the event of an alleged breach of the agreement, but denies a
                        similar right to Iran. Iran further claims that there are adequate
                        arbitration mechanisms in its existing agreement and demands special
                        consideration for having helped the companies work out arbitration
                        arrangements with the Arab countries, where no such mechanisms had existed.
                        This special consideration, in the Iranian mind, should take the form of
                        exempting Iran from the arbitration provisions worked out for Arab producing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>During ten days of discussions in London (December 20–30) there was
                        apparently some progress on the quit-claim problem, but the arbitration
                        provision remains a sticking point. On December 31 the Prime Minister told
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> that the
                        Consortium's offer was “entirely unacceptable,” adding that “it would be
                        utterly impossible for his Government to present anything less than equal
                        treatment to the Iranian Parliament.” The companies have taken an equally
                        strong position against retaining unique arbitration provisions for Iran.
                        However, as of December 31 it was evident that both sides had some
                        expectation of being able to settle these differences by January 26. The
                        Consortium was to have despatched three high-level representatives from
                        London to Tehran on January 5 to resume negotiations, but no word has yet
                        been received as to their progress.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">A

                            on January 6 reported that the Consortium representatives in Tehran were
                            prepared to yield significantly on the arbitration issue, but that their
                            new proposals would still fall short of the completely reciprocal
                            arbitration rights which the Iranians had been seeking. They also
                            pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> that any

                            >KHOMEINI</persName>'S OPPOSITION TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT</p>
                    <p>The opposition of Ayatollah Maj Ruhollah Seyed Musavi Khomeini, the leading
                        Iranian religious figure, is symptomatic of widespread popular opposition to
                        Government policies. One aspect of these policies has been to destroy the
                        power of the clergy. To attempt to weaken the religious structure of Iranian
                        society, as the Shah appears to be doing, believing this necessary to carry
                        on his campaign to modernize Iran, has proven to be a dangerous course of
                        political action. Popular reactions to this policy are already apparent. As
                        reactionary as the present clergy is, the very nature of religion in Iran is
                        such that it is capable of change and adaptation. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s opposition represents the
                        reaction of traditional Iranian society. As spokesman for the religious
                        community <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s opposition is,
                        in one sense, political protest; more importantly, it indicates the troubled
                        state of Iranian civilization.</p>
                    <p>During the past two years there has been a reawakened opposition among the
                        religious community to the regime's policies. This antipathy has been
                        extended in recent months to open criticism of American policy in Iran.
                        Speaking for the religious community, <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName> has said that American policy is responsible for
                        many of Iran's ills and that it is supporting an unpopular regime for its
                        own purposes to the detriment of the people as a whole as did the Russians
                        and British before them. Given this alienation from the regime and this
                        antipathy to the American role in Iran, and given the widespread support
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s views have among the
                        traditional world of bazaar, village and small city, the reasons for
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s rise to political
                        prominence herald resistance from quarters of the Iranian population that
                        have not been in active opposition before.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s education, learning and
                        widespread support within the clergy made him eligible to succeed Ayatollah
                        Borujerdi as the leader of Iranian Islam, a position made vacant by
                        Borujerdi's death in 1961 before <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName> became a political figure. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s political abilities became
                        evident in 1963 when he first spoke out against the anti-religious policies
                        of the Government. <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s
                        political stand is not an isolated one; it is a view shared by a significant
                        mass of Iranians.</p>
                    <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0151"/>
                    <p>The religious community and the values they hold play an important part in
                        Iranian society. Because the ulema have expressed disapproval of some of the
                        Shah's goals and condemned almost all of the Shah's methods, the Shah has
                        decided to carry out his plans to change the Iranian social structure
                        without their support or assistance. He has branded the clergy “black
                        reactionaries” who are opposed to reform. He has gone so far as to exile
                        their leader <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> for anti-regime
                        speeches and for alleged anti-reform attitudes.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> has
                        opposed certain features of the Shah's program. He has condemned completely
                        the Shah's autocratic methods. There is little question, too, that he is
                        reactionary and provincial in outlook, no matter how learned. Paradoxically,
                        there are few leaders in Iran who by training would be better able to
                        formulate for the devout a religious justification for modernization.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> is recognized as the
                        leading philosophical exponent of ijtehad, the Shia doctrine whereby change
                        can be adapted to an Islamic framework. But it is important to recognize
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> does not speak only for
                        himself. He represents the point of view of traditional Iranian society.</p>
                    <p>Part of the conflict between the regime on the one hand and the
                        religiously-oriented masses on the other is over the pace and means of
                        carrying out reforms. The clergy has under great pressure grudgingly
                        recognized that reforms in Iranian society must be made. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> says he is not opposed to land
                        distribution and that land distribution is consistent with Islam if just
                        compensation is made. He has opposed, for example, the emancipation of women
                        under present circumstances stating that emancipation without education is
                        meaningless. In almost every instance the principle of a particular reform
                        has been accepted; the challenge has come over methodology. The clergy by
                        its training and philosophical outlook is tradition-bound. The basic changes
                        implicit in some of the Shah's reforms, such as land distribution, require
                        adaptations that will markedly alter the whole religious structure. “What
                        will the position of the ulema be without the waqf?” is the kind of question
                        that has deep philosophical and religious implications for the ulema and
                        Iran as a whole. That there has been opposition on the part of the ulema is
                        inevitable. But within the traditional structure, the power of the ulema
                        might have been used to justify and institutionalize the changes taking
                        place.</p>
                    <p>Had the Shah consulted with the leaders of the religious community,
                        considered their ideas, and had he given the ulema a limited constructive
                        role to play, opposition to his reforms from the religious would have been
                        considerably lessened. This was former Prime Minister Ali Amini's belief and
                        still is his position. However, these are “might have been's.” What is now
                        clear is that <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>'s exile has
                        aroused dormant nationalist feelings. The Shah and the United States have
                        been branded as both anti-nationalist and anti-religious. This new attitude
                        has tarnished our <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0152"/>formerly
                        favorable image, poses a threat to our interests in Iran, and will certainly
                        make our task there far more difficult.</p>

                        <item>Our security interests are too compelling for us to allow favorable
                            indications of Iran's increasing self-reliance to obscure its continuing
                            vulnerability and basic weaknesses or to conclude too early that U.S.
                            objectives can be achieved without significant participation in Iranian
                            affairs. Iran is in transition, deeply engaged in the process of
                            difficult adjustment to the initiation of basic reforms and the effort
                            to achieve rapid modernization. Although progress in this respect is
                            encouraging it is not yet self-sustaining and does not insure continued
                            internal stability.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Our leverage in the past has stemmed in large measure from the inputs
                            of our economic, technical and military assistance. These modes of
                            assistance on a large scale have contributed significantly to the
                            forward movement experienced during the past decade and secured our
                            entree into key administrative, economic and military avenues.
                            Fortunately, there is considerable acceptance among the present ruling
                            society of the value of Iran's ties with the West and increasing
                            agreement with the stress which we have placed on orderly modernization
                            and socio-economic development. Under a continuance of present
                            circumstances therefore we need not look forward to a drastic loss of
                            influence as our material sources of leverage disappear.</item>

                            less closely into the government's future decision making process and
                            shall probably adopt more nearly the role of trusted ally rather than

                            for development and to take the difficult political decisions involved
                            in such critical areas as overhauling the tax system and improving

                        <item>We should endeavor to maintain flexibility in our aid policy so as to

                    <p>At 10:00 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EST) Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHA1"
                            >Mansur</persName> was shot and seriously wounded by a young man
                        reportedly carrying a Koran and a picture of <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName> as the Prime Minister arrived at the Parliament to
                        present the new oil agreements. We tentatively infer that the assassin may
                        have been a conservative supporter of <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Ayatollah
                            Khomeini</persName>, who was exiled to Turkey for anti-regime activity
                        at the time of ratification of our Status <persName corresp="#p_MBD1"
                            >Bill</persName>. Although <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName>'s motivation is primarily opposition to secularist
                        reforms, he thus succeeded in getting official endorsement of his
                        nationalist (in this case, anti-American) pose. The attempt on the Prime
                        Minister's life, if the assassin's sympathy for <persName corresp="#p_KAR1"
                            >Khomeini</persName> is publicly established, has unfortunate
                        implications of opposition to Iran's relationship with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Though the event will tend to weaken the regime, it would require genius in
                        mishandling the situation for it to precipitate the kind of chaos which has
                        followed modern assassinations (successful) in Iran. The Shah is in personal
                        charge of the situation, having returned immediately from the ski resort
                        above Tehran.</p>
                    <p>The wire services have noted that the assassin is young, but have not
                        labelled him a religious fanatic yet. They have clearly labelled <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName> a progressive reformist. The wire
                        reports leave room for the almost certainly unjustified inference that the
                        assassin opposed the oil agreements.</p>

                            that political dissidence in Iran was at a relatively low point, viewed
                            against the experience of the previous 50 years, and it saw the patterns

                        assassin and his accomplices, all members of a small religious society
                        called Maktab Towhid, were part of a larger movement. On the contrary, the
                        assassination seems to have been planned without outside help. Anger caused
                        by the exile to Turkey by the regime of the leading Iranian religious
                        figure, Ayatollah Ruhollah Haj Musavi Khomeini, seems to have in part
                        motivated Bokharai to shoot <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>,
                        but there was no known connection between the Maktab Tow-hid and the
                        movement headed by <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName>. There
                        are hundreds of small religious groups like Maktab Towhid that could cause
                        religiously motivated violence of the sort that has just taken place. The
                        security measures taken by the regime have prevented the formation of
                        broadly based political or religious opposition movements. At the same time,
                        fragmentation of the opposition and formation of small conspiratorial <pb

                        of the activities of Maktab Towhid is a case in point. There is considerable
                        discontent in Iran because of continued repression of opposition groups,
                        exile of <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Ayatollah Khomeini</persName>,
                        unpopular measures passed by the government such as the recent Status of

                    </list>
                    <p>A major irritant in our relations with Iran for some months has been the
                        affair of Khaibar Gudarzian, an Iranian national who has been misusing the
                        procedures of both our courts and our Congress. In cases now pending in the
                        New York courts the information available to us indicates he is attempting
                        to obtain money from the Shah's brother and sister by means of false
                        allegations, forged documents, and fraudulent claims of service of process.
                        As long ago as May 1963 he began airing false charges of corruption in our
                        aid program in Iran before the <persName corresp="#p_MCJL1"
                            >McClellan</persName> Committee, through the press, and to the
                        Department of Justice. Investigations of practically all of those charges by
                        the Departments of State and Justice have disclosed that the evidence
                        submitted by Gudarzian consists of forgeries and fabrications, but there has
                        thus far been no public refutation by the Executive Branch or by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJL1">McClellan</persName> Committee.</p>
                    <p>This Department has taken a number of steps during the past several months to
                        ensure that justice is done and to counteract the harmful publicity
                        Gudarzian's activities have generated. Late in December, Secretary <pb
                            n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0158"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> brought the problem directly to
                        the attention of the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, and
                        the Governor of New York. Background briefings were given to the press in
                        early January. The Department of Justice has been cooperating, within limits
                        imposed by our federal system and by the separation of executive and
                        judicial powers on its capacity to intervene where private litigation is
                        involved. Competent private counsel is defending the Prince and Princess and
                        there is good prospect that the default judgment previously awarded to
                        Gudarzian will be set aside. The New York Court has ordered that its referee
                        go to Tehran at an early date to hear witnesses who will testify that the
                        Prince and Princess were in Iran on the date they are alleged to have been
                        served with process in New York. A Federal grand jury investigation into
                        Gudarzian's activities was launched in December to determine whether
                        sufficient evidence could be obtained to try him on criminal charges for
                        some of his questionable activities.</p>
                    <p>Throughout these developments, the Shah has become increasingly frustrated
                        over our inability to halt Gudarzian's machinations once and for all, bring
                        him rapidly to book, and dispel in some dramatic fashion the adverse
                        publicity generated about the royal family and Iran in general. On February
                        13, the Shah's anger erupted violently in the decision to discharge his
                        excellent Ambassador to Washington who has, in fact, done all any Ambassador
                        could have done. The Shah is clearly over-reacting, and we cannot be sure
                        that he will not take further and even more extreme steps before there is
                        any very decisive resolution of the Gudarzian affair. Our relationship with
                        the Shah must be maintained at a tolerable level as it is a key factor in
                        our efforts to extend the stability and progress shown by Iran in the past
                        decade.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State is exploring with the Department of Justice whether
                        there might be any extraordinary steps the Department of Justice could take
                        at this point that would quickly extricate the Prince and Princess and end
                        Gudarzian's abuse of our judicial system.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">A

                            false. He noted such an action would be of immense value in meeting the
                            understandable Iranian dismay over the Gudarzian affair and would create
                            a better atmosphere for the Secretary's talks with the Shah and other

                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MCJL1">McClellan</persName> indicated that he

                        to set further hearings on the subject of the Gudarzian allegations and to
                        pose questions to Gudarzian which would result in his either committing
                        perjury or withdrawing the charges. Unfortunately, insofar as timing is
                        concerned, the Senator indicated that his committee has just received
                        additional “documentation” from Gudarzian with respect to certain charges
                        and this material has not been checked out. The Senator indicated that he
                        would like to have someone from the Justice Department and the State
                        Department work with members of his staff in reviewing this material. (Mr.

                            had been a large-scale diversion of U.S. aid funds intended for Iran and
                            had discovered no evidence substantiating the truthfulness of those
                            charges. On the contrary, the preponderance of the evidence pointed to
                            their deceptiveness and falsity, and a complete transcript of the
                            hearings had been turned over to the Department of Justice for its
                            determination as to whether there had been any violation of Federal law

                        audience with Shah last evening which marked by extreme cordiality and frank
                        exchanges of views. This is the first of six messages reporting
                        conversations. Subjects concerned are: 1) Iranian reform program and general
                        foreign policy (including Viet-nam); 2) Iran's military policy; 3) Gudarzian
                        case; 4) Bredin case; 5) Fairhurst problem; 6) Iran-Arab relations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary began by conveying President's greetings to Shah and stating he
                        knew President would be interested to learn Shah's views concerning progress
                        of reform program in Iran. Shah gave brief expose along lines familiar to
                        Dept, reiterating such points as that White Revolution is supported by
                        nation with exception minor groups such as reactionary mullahs and
                        dispossessed landlords; that revolution had been achieved without bloodshed
                        and without dispossessing landlord group of their wealth other than land;
                        that land being paid for; that partnership between workers and employers had
                        been established; that literacy corps had been a tremendous success; and
                        that Shah was confident White Revolution would continue to succeed.</p>
                    <p>During discussion of Literacy Corps, Secretary conveyed message from Sargent
                        Shriver, saying latter would welcome any comments or suggestions Shah might
                        have regarding operations of Peace Corps in Iran. Shah made very favorable
                        comments on Peace Corps volunteers, noting their dedication to duty and the
                        good reception many of them had achieved in this country.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then took up South Viet-nam, setting forth problems faced by us and
                        factors which made us determined not to be driven out of that country or to
                        abandon its commitments there. Said he believed that maintenance integrity
                        of American commitment to South Viet-nam was important for world peace.</p>
                    <p>Shah said he completely agreed with Secretary and was delighted to receive
                        this reaffirmation of U.S. determination to stand by Viet-nam. He recalled
                        he had told Pres Johnson that if U.S. pulled out of Viet-nam, free world
                        would lose confidence in U.S. policy and promises, that progress of <pb
                            n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"/>deterioration would begin in other
                        non-Communist countries of Southeast Asia, Shah added: “In Viet-nam you are
                        doing what you should do.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary said that he had found Policy Planning Group in the <gloss
                            target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> to be extremely valuable. He outlined the
                        advantages of having a group of people who were disconnected from the daily
                        problems and had the time to devote themselves to consideration of
                        long-range issues. He said he would appreciate the privilege of receiving
                        the Shah's views on long-range problems affecting the Middle East. The Shah
                        was clearly very pleased to have been offered this opportunity for
                        consultation and said that he would be delighted to take advantage of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Discussion then turned to specific Iranian and Middle Eastern topics which

                        Shah—Iran's military policy. During Secretary's audience with Shah April 7,
                        Shah said that Iran's military policy was entirely defensive and reflected
                        the determination not to be taken by surprise from any quarter. He said that
                        there was complete agreement between Iran and US as to the menace of
                        Communist aggression from the north. If this occurred, it would provoke
                        international conflict. He added that there might be disagreement between us
                        as to dangers to Iran from other quarters, and he thought the US should
                        welcome a situation wherein it would not be required to become involved
                        militarily in defending Iran in the event of an attack from a country other
                        than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Iran could not afford to be
                        weak in the face of Arab claims against a part of Iranian territory and in
                        view of the uncertainty as to the <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0163"
                        />future of the Persian Gulf State. Accordingly, Iran had sought and
                        obtained a loan of $200 million for military purchases from the US and it
                        was now time to consider the need for additional such purchases.</p>
                    <p>The Shah then said that the answers to the economic questionnaire which had
                        been prepared by the Embassy were now ready and would soon be turned over.
                        The study which had been undertaken showed that there would be $680 million
                        available to Iran for borrowing in the next 10 years, even after the
                        establishment and maintenance of an eight percent economic growth rate. One
                        of the future sources of foreign exchange income to which the Shah attached
                        particular importance was the establishment of ammonia plants. He made clear
                        that he was confident that Iran would have no trouble in assuming an
                        additional loan burden for the purchase of military equipment.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Iran was right in being sensitive about threats to
                        its territorial integrity. If a firm attitude was taken at the very
                        beginning against aggressive tendencies, the danger of aggression was
                        greatly reduced.</p>

                        discussed Gudarzian case at some length. He told Shah that only other matter
                        which had recently been taking up more of his time than this affair was
                        Viet-nam. He expressed opinion that although it has taken a long time,
                        Gudarzian's days are now numbered. Secretary thought it possible that
                        Gudarzian might flee the country.</p>
                    <p>Shah expressed pleasure with statements in Senate but revealed that he still

                        <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 30. Secretary's conversation with
                        Shah—Iranian-Arab relations. Major part of audience which Secretary had with
                        Shah April 7 was concerned with Iranian-Arab relations and developments in
                        Arab world. Shah outlined his well-known concern with subversive and
                        aggressive policies of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, with
                        particular reference to Arab claims on Khuzestan and the danger of Nasser's
                        taking over the Persian Gulf States. Secretary said that US had been very
                        patient with Nasser but that this patience now running out and US relations
                        with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> now hanging by a very slender
                        thread. Secretary thought it was encouraging, however, that other Arab
                        States had clearly shown unwillingness to submit to Egyptian hegemony. He
                        thought these states would be supported in that attitude. Shah said he
                        entirely agreed and remarked he had been surprised by the determination not
                        to be pushed around by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> which
                        President Bourguiba had exhibited during his recent state visit to Iran.</p>
                    <p>Shah said attitude of Saudi Arabia was also very constructive. Relations
                        between Iran and Saudi Arabia had grown extremely close. He hoped, however,
                        that Saudis would not press Iran too hard about Israel. Iran desired good
                        relations with Saudi Arabia, but would not abandon Israel to achieve them.
                        Israel was in existence as a sovereign state and its relations with Iran
                        were good. Besides, there was the saying that “the enemy of my enemy is my
                        friend”.</p>
                    <p>Shah asked what US would do if Nasser attacked Saudi Arabia. Secretary
                        replied that Saudi assistance to Yemeni Royalists created difficult <pb
                            n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0165"/>problem for US, which had been made
                        clear to Saudis. In Viet-nam US was resisting the infiltration of men and
                        war material across the border, and was itself attempting to stop this by
                        military action in the guilty country. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> should attack Saudi Arabia in area other than Yemeni border
                        region where staging of Saudi aid to Royalists taking place, US would
                        support Saudi Arabia.</p>
                    <p>But if border staging area attacked by Egyptians, this would be another
                        matter. Secretary added that US would like to see the Yemenis get their own
                        country back.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked Shah about Iran's relations with Iraq. Shah reiterated his
                        well-known concern over desires of Iraqi leaders to make Iraq subservient to
                        Nasser. Iran's only policy was that Iraq should be truly independent. There
                        was the problem of the Shatt al Arab between the two countries and also that
                        of subversive activity in Khuzestan originating in Iraq. With regard to the
                        Kurdish problem, the Shah said that, while it was helping them, Iran was not
                        encouraging the Kurds to resume hostilities. At the same time, Iran
                        considered that in its relations with Iraq it held a trump card in the
                        Kurds, which it would not relinquish as long as a “truly national”
                        government was not established in Iraq. The Shah said: “We are not going to
                        let the Iraqi Kurds down until a national government is established in
                        Baghdad”.</p>
                    <p>In a discussion of Arab-Israeli relations, Secretary said that Israel seems
                        only matter on which Arabs can achieve any degree of unity. The Palestine
                        issue was valuable to the Arabs for this political purpose, but Secretary
                        did not believe it likely that Arabs would engage in military action against
                        Israel. At the same time, US had made very clear to Israelis that they would
                        receive no US support should they undertake military action against Arab
                        States because of latter's operations to divert Jordan waters. There was,
                        however, danger of Arab or Israeli military action if either side became
                        prey of fear that it was about to be attacked by the other. Therefore, it
                        was important that there not be created an armaments imbalance in the Near
                        East and that was reason why US found itself in the distasteful position of
                        participating in an arms race in the area as result of its efforts to
                        prevent such imbalance.</p>
                    <p>Shah mentioned his forthcoming trip to Morocco and said that while there he
                        would endeavor to persuade King to embark on a reform program.</p>

                    <p>The most recent reports on the shooting incident which took place at Marble
                        Palace in Tehran on Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">April 10.</note>
                        morning indicate that a member of the Imperial Guard shot his way into the
                        palace with a submachine gun in an apparent attempt to reach the Shah. Two
                        guards and the assailant are reported killed. In announcing the incident the
                        Government has attributed the shooting to a quarrel between a conscript
                        soldier and a regular member of the palace guard. No mention was made of the
                        location where the shooting took place. Tehran has remained quiet and the
                        Shah, who was apparently in his office throughout the episode, is said to
                        have continued with his regular appointments for the day.</p>

                        report indicates that security records disclosed no prior adverse
                        information regarding the assailant and that it is not yet known whether or
                        not the assassination attempt was a plot. The fact that the assailant had
                        made a trip to Meshed in 1962 would indicate that he had probably made a
                        religious pilgrimage to the Shrine of Imam Reza, which is customary for
                        devout Muslims of Iran's predominantly Shia belief. On the basis of
                        information reported thus far, we do not anticipate any immediately
                        significant political effect or threat to the continued maintenance of
                        internal stability in Iran. We do not discount the possibility however that
                        further investigation may disclose the motive for this attempt at
                        assassination and that it may be found related to the desperate frustration
                        of certain minority elements of the Shah's reform opposition, which led to
                        the recent assassination of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHA1"

                        essential he get a clear sense of what we really want in Iran. You in 1962
                        and then <gloss target="#t_JFK1">JFK</gloss> in 1963 preached reform to the
                        Shah. Now he takes it as his own idea, and wowed his <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> hosts recently by a 45-minute peroration on the subject.</p>
                    <p>But the Shah's palaver is better than his performance. With rapidly rising
                        oil revenues ($750 million last year), he's tempted to spend far too much on
                        fancy military hardware and not enough on meeting his own people's rising
                        expectations. He's got a good land reform program but lags badly on the
                        credit facilities and marketing arrangements to help the peasants out. In a
                        word, he doesn't pay enough attention to his own economy, but loves (now
                        that we've stopped the Soviets for him) to worry about the piddling Arab
                        threat.</p>
                    <p>Given Iran's wealth we've practically disengaged from major aid programs, but
                        are still getting his military purchases through some skillful <gloss

                        keeping the Shah steered right will depend largely on <persName

                        after the recent assassination attempt another such attempt is now regarded

                        will follow soon, but somehow there is impression that cost of life
                        insurance policy on Shah must have gone up. This phenomenon will bear
                        watching, but cannot be developed further at this time.</p>
                    <p>There certainly are efforts under way to plug gaps in arrangements for

                        time that regime is further tightening up after the assassination attempt.
                        It has been keeping tight control of any opposition activities all along. We
                        continue to believe that regime is capable of dealing with any disorders
                        that might be fomented by opposition groups. Assassination by fanatics who
                        are willing to die in the process is another matter, but as Shah will be
                        better protected we do not on balance see any deterioration.<note n="4"

                        <item>Iran, as it has for the last decade, continues to present a picture of
                            relative peace and stability. Ruled by a pro-Western monarch who permits
                            no organized open opposition, the country is making slight but visible
                            progress in all fields without the revolutionary convulsions which have
                            struck much of the Middle East.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The basic weakness of the situation has been heavily underscored in
                            the last month, however, by the attempt on the Shah's life by a
                            conscript member of the Imperial Guard. Both supporters and opponents of
                            the Shah expressed great concern at the incident—supporters because to
                            insiders the Shah is indispensable, opponents because the Shah has not
                            permitted the development of persons or institutions capable of
                            continuing an orderly government if he were suddenly removed. The Shah's
                            reaction to the incident has been mild, considering that it came less
                            than six months after the assassination of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>. There has been no widespread
                            and indiscriminate crackdown on all opposition elements as would have
                            been the case a few years ago. The Shah appears firm in his belief that
                            he has widespread popular support for his “White Revolution” and that
                            any opposition may be irritating but not dangerous. Coupled with this is
                            his frequently expressed belief that he is under divine protection until
                            he accomplishes his mission.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The opposition to the Shah is so disorganized and fragmented as to be
                            powerless. A substantial portion of the Moslem clergy disapproves of his
                            reform program because it involves redistribution of lands they have
                            depended on, and suffrage for women. The clergy are reluctant to force a
                            showdown, however, because the Shah has demonstrated that he is willing
                            to destroy this group as a political force if he is pushed too far. The
                            nationalist opposition—the National Front followers of former Prime
                            Minister Mossadeq—are likewise in disarray. Watched and harried by the
                            security services, there is little they can do that is not known to the
                            government. The leadership has split between the older and more cautious
                            who have advocated waiting until the right time to make a bid for power,
                            and the younger radicals who insist that such an opportunity will never
                            come and the only solution is violence. Nationalist students in the
                            United States contend that an underground movement divorced from the old
                            leadership and devoted to violence is getting under way.</item>

                        <item>There are few major problems between the U.S. and Iran. The American
                            image has held up better in Iran than in most countries in the Middle
                            East. Within recent months, however, this image has been tarnished by a
                            clumsy presentation of the Status of Forces bill to the Iranian
                            parliament, which raised memories of the hated “capitulations” formerly
                            imposed by European powers. In an unfortunate bit of timing, a
                            $200-million U.S. military credit bill was presented to parliament a few
                            days later, giving rise to charges that Washington had bribed the
                            Iranian Government to grant widespread immunities to US personnel.
                            Although the Shah has increased his room for maneuver by a series of
                            friendly gestures toward the Soviet Union, he remains firmly committed
                            to the West. His main external concern is expanded
                                pro-<persName>Nasir</persName> activities in the Persian Gulf area.
                            This has given rise to greater Iranian activity in the Middle East in
                            the form of providing aid to Kurdish rebels in Iraq, aid to Yemeni
                            royalists, and cooperation with Israel on security matters and in
                            connection with land reform.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Shah's “White Revolution”—distribution of landlord-owned villages
                            to the peasants, the Literacy Corps to educate the villagers, and a
                            medical and development corps to work in the villages—has started a
                            trend that probably can never be reversed. Whether a bureaucracy that is
                            noted for its inefficiency and corruption can maintain sufficient
                            momentum to keep up with the rising expectations of the population is
                            questionable. At this juncture the death of the Shah would probably
                            produce a period of chaos from which a military dictatorship would be
                            likely to arise.</item>

                    <p>There was one item on the agenda—a discussion of the Iranian situation by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>. The substance of
                        his remarks was as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0171"/>
                    <p>As an introduction, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                        stated that Iran has a 1200-mile border with the Soviet Union and has a long
                        border with a stirred-up Arab World. If the Soviets again try to take over
                        Iran, they would get Iranian oil and outflank all other sources of Middle
                        East oil—a heavy blow to Western Europe. By taking over Iran, the Soviets
                        would also have an open shot to East Africa. We, therefore, have to retain
                        our influence over Iran, and it should not be too costly for us to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>In September 1959 Iran agreed not to permit any Thor missile bases on its
                        soil. From the Cuban crisis to date the Soviets have followed a change of
                        tactics. Radio Moscow has been relatively mild in its propaganda attacks on
                        the Shah's regime (although clandestine radio attacks continue). Natural
                        trading patterns continue and the Soviets have increased slightly the
                        numbers of their people in Iran—e.g., more cultural missions. Joint
                        enterprises on border area irrigation and Caspian Sea fishing also have been
                        developed. The Iranians, however, are very sensible and very suspicious of
                        the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Shah is worried about his people's becoming too complacent about the
                        Soviets. He has asked the U.S. and the U.K. for recommendations to improve
                        his security police. He has never made a move on a problem dealing with the
                        Soviets without consulting the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Shah is also very concerned about the Persian <persName>Gulf</persName>
                        and the Arab minorities in the oil lands of southern Iran. There is
                        considerable agitation of Arab minorities by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>-subsidized newspapers in Kuwait.</p>
                    <p>But the Shah is a Commander-in-Chief in fact, and he worries about various
                        things a great deal, especially Arab unity. He uses his concerns to push us
                        for more aid. He has stated he is concerned about <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>. He is disillusioned, but in his own mind he has stopped
                        worrying about military problems because he knows he can be assured of U.S.
                        support. The modernization of the armed forces, a program agreed to in July
                        1964, is progressing well.</p>
                    <p>He is happy that the U.K. presence in the Persian <persName>Gulf</persName>
                        continues, but the Shah worries about the day when the U.K. pulls out of the
                            <persName>Gulf</persName> and he will have to fill the vacuum.</p>
                    <p>The Shah's government reform program is going ahead—in a Persian way. The
                        human materials in Iran are good. The literacy rate is still low but
                        growing. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> was
                        impressed with the basic intelligence of the Iranian people and stated that
                        the Shah now has a government he never had before.</p>
                    <p>The one great danger to continuing progress and stability is that some one
                        will kill the Shah. Each year that passes, however, will decrease the chaos
                        following the demise of the Shah. The main factor contributing to this
                        improved situation is the improvements being made in the Iranian armed
                        forces.</p>

                    <p>The present Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> (Major General
                            <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName>, U.S.A.) has done a
                        superb job. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> hoped
                        that his successor (Major General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                            >Jablonsky</persName>, U.S.A.) would have similarly high qualifications
                        to permit continued effective influence. Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                            >MAAG</gloss> serves as a military adviser to the Shah; he goes to the
                        Shah and sees him alone; but he still has managed to maintain excellent
                        relations with the Iranian General Staff. On the latest military shopping
                        list of the Shah, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                        has talked to the Finance Minister to give the Shah the facts; it is a
                        constant struggle to keep the Shah's appetite within bounds—e.g., he is
                        talking about getting one squadron of F–111's by 1970. Nevertheless, so long
                        as we recognize that the Shah is moody and he stays alive, the U.S. will be
                        able to handle him.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that, when
                        General <persName>Abdul Hassain Hejazi</persName>, Chief of the Iranian
                        Supreme Commander's Staff, visited the U.S., the Iraqis were getting more
                        support from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> than we had estimated
                        at the time. Nevertheless, General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1"
                            >Wheeler</persName> argued that Arab unity was a long time in the
                        future, and noted that General Hejazi was a mirror of the Shah and probably
                        never has an original idea of his own. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1"
                            >Wheeler</persName> also noted that improved Iranian relations with the
                        Soviets are all to the good. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                            >Holmes</persName> replied that most officials in the Iranian Government
                        are realistic. Only some of them appear to be complacent about the Soviets
                        and they are really preoccupied with their own problems.</p>

                        if the Kurds are currently a problem to the Iranian Government. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> stated that the Iranian
                        Army still occupies Kurdish areas, but that the government is now beginning
                        to treat the Kurds as Persians and is instituting an aid program for
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> noted that the Shah
                        was very interested in the Concord Squadron, and was impressed with his
                        visit to the Bon Homme Richard. He has talked with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGPD1">Adams</persName>, <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1"
                            >CINCSTRIKE</gloss>, and would be willing to have a floating U.S.
                        reserve to be located in his ports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJC1">Kitchen</persName> asked about Iran's
                        relations with Israel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                            >Holmes</persName> stated that the Israelis frequently force feed the
                        Shah with raw information on the Arab threat. Israeli technical assistance
                        men also aid and abet this in the oil areas of southern Iran.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> stated that in 1958
                        we did not live up to our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> commitments.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> urged that, in the
                        current five-year modernization program for the armed forces, we do not
                        arouse the Shah's suspicions by permitting <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> slippages to develop. General <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145"

                        <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that there has been a
                        great effort by all services to overcome <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        slippages—a problem not unique to Iran.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that the <gloss

                        encouraging report on Iran—such was not the case several years ago. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJC1">Kitchen</persName> observed that a lot of
                        the credit for the improved situation in Iran belongs to the Mobile Training
                        Teams who served with the Iranian armed forces. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> added that the training of Iranian
                        officers in the U.S. also must be recognized as a reason for the improved
                        situation, although it was agreed that a “Nasser” might well have been
                        trained in the process.</p>

                    <p>1205. Shah's Interest in Arms. After giving me build-up re economic and
                        social progress Iran is making and his philosophy how Iran must be capable
                        of coping with war by proxy,<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">In telegram 1204,
                            April 27, <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> reported that
                            during a private talk following presentation of his credentials the Shah
                            had discussed his “White Revolution” at length, and had made the point
                            that the more successful his revolution became, the more desperate were
                            his enemies. (Ibid., POL 15–1 IRAN)</note> Shah twenty-seventh stressed
                        importance of prompt and favorable U.S. response to his recent requests for
                        more modern military equipment.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out U.S. disposition toward Iran has been uniquely friendly, there
                        being no other country where U.S. has involved itself in 5-year arms
                        program. More than that equipment in that program is well advanced over
                        equipment which we providing most other countries in this part of world.</p>
                    <p>Referring to economic review currently under study, I said Shah was on right
                        track in seeking “balanced program” of economic and military progress. Shah
                        said that he hoped following his return from forthcoming month-long journey,
                        economic review and subject of his arms needs can be brought to successful
                        conclusion, e.g., end of May.</p>
                    <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0174"/>
                    <p>Shah said main point is that it takes such long time from date of order to
                        date of delivery. Meanwhile, area threat (Nasser) is increasingly imminent.
                        He, therefore, must have early decision as to whether he can have advanced
                        equipment, so adequate training and planning can be undertaken in years
                        intervening before equipment is actually delivered.</p>
                    <p>Having made his major pitch to General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1"
                            >Eckhardt</persName> (being reported separately) re his desire for
                        F–111, <persName>Sheridans</persName> and more <persName>Hawks</persName>,
                        Shah said he wanted to mention to me one further “detail.” Originally he had
                        asked for destroyers for defense of <persName>Persian Gulf</persName>.
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had demurred, on basis destroyers
                        beyond Iran's capabilities. His request for motor torpedo boats had also
                        been turned down. Mention had been made, however, of “bull-pup” air to
                        surface missiles. It obvious, he said, that if Iran had capability deliver
                        its own weaponry, it much preferable to time-consuming maritime vehicles. I
                        told Shah this was new subject as far as I was concerned and I would have to
                        look into it.</p>
                    <p>Shah made clear his greatest defense concern is <persName>Persian
                            Gulf</persName> area. He said he had to have suitable weaponry and would
                        like to get it from the U.S. if possible.</p>

                    <p>The Shah is important to the United States as the reform-minded ruler of one
                        of the most stable countries in the Middle East. He considers, not without
                        justification, that Iran has been our most dependable ally on the southern
                        periphery of the Soviet Bloc. In spite of some issues that have arisen
                        recently (most notably our differing assessment of the Nasser threat to Iran
                        and the Shah's irritation at our inability to bring rapidly to justice an
                        Iranian who has been abusing our Congress and Courts with false charges of
                        corruption against the royal family), there remains a broad consensus
                        between us and the Shah on the really fundamental issues of foreign and
                        domestic policy. As our posture toward Iran changes gradually in keeping
                        with the country's increasing financial strength, administrative
                        capabilities, and broadening foreign ties, the Shah is watchful for signs of
                        our continuing sponsorship of Iran's welfare and security and, most
                        particularly, our regard for his counsel on key world issues. I believe that
                        the proposed telephone call from you on May 18 would be an important step in
                        maintaining our fruitful relations with Iran.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">A

                    <p>We have a massage problem with the Shah of Iran, who has a 24-hour stopover
                        in New York Tuesday, 18 May, en route from Brazil and Argentina to Ottawa
                        and Paris. We naturally evaded feelers that he come down here, so <persName

                    <p>The Shah has been very good on Vietnam and the Dominican Republic, and we
                        don't want <persName>De Gaulle</persName> to talk him out of those
                        positions. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> will be talking
                        to the Shah in the Waldorf Towers from 10:30 to 11:30, so you'd have no
                        problem getting through to him then. Here are a few suggested talking

                                recent attempt on his life (you wired him). You know from your own
                                role at the time of President Kennedy's assassination what a shock

                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> met with the Shah for one and a
                        quarter hours at the Waldorf Towers. Mr. <persName>Chester Carter</persName>
                        of Protocol was also present.</p>
                    <p>The Shah in discussing his recent visits to Brazil and Argentina said that it
                        had seemed quite useful to tell them of Iran's experiences in facing land
                        reform problems frankly and in undertaking rigorous battles against
                        corruption. He also had had opportunities to state publicly his strong
                        endorsement of United States positions on Vietnam and the Dominican
                        Republic. This seemed to him important, because the President is taking just
                        the right line in a very difficult period and deserved the public support of
                        those who agreed with him. The pity was that many others agreed but were
                        unwilling to say so except privately.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> congratulated the
                        Shah on the position he had taken and expressed our appreciation for his
                        firm and forthright backing of our efforts to meet difficult situations. The
                        Governor then explained in considerable detail the course of developments in
                        Vietnam and the Dominican Republic, and the specific aspects of our policy
                        in each situation. The Shah reiterated his support of United States firmness
                        in dealing with Communist-directed challenges of these sorts. He inquired
                        whether any results had been achieved by five day stop in bombing and
                        expressed approval of decision to renew operations.</p>
                    <p>Talk turned to the forthcoming Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers. The Governor
                        expressed the hope that the Shah's representatives could play a useful role
                        in preventing the conference from being captured by extremist delegations.
                        The Shah stated this to be his intention, and recalled he had discussed the
                        matter with the Secretary of State during the latter's visit to Tehran in
                        April. The Shah said he had not decided who would lead the Iranian
                        delegation but it might be the Prime Minister. The Governor encouraged the
                        Shah to send the Prime Minister, whose official position and personal
                        qualities would enable him to deal effectively with the heads of government
                        present at the conference. The Shah said he would welcome continuing
                        discussion with the United States and exchange of information on
                        preparations for the conference. He suggested that the American Ambassador
                        in Tehran might be armed with reference material. Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> assured the Shah that our Ambassador
                        in Tehran would be equipped to discuss all aspects of preparations for
                        effective participation in the Afro-Asian Conference.</p>
                    <p>Turning to his own region, the Shah referred to Iran's complete alliance with
                        the United States against the “ultimate Communist danger.” At the same time,
                        he said, it would be regrettable if the major powers entered into limited
                        area disputes. Therefore, he felt it important that Iran should strengthen
                        itself to deal with any problems that might arise in, for example, the
                            <persName>Persian Gulf</persName>. He expressed confidence that the
                        situation could be kept manageable with the military strength Iran was
                        building. <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0178"/>He was concerned about
                        the situation in Iraq. Iran had substantial assets there, with the
                            <persName>Kurds</persName>, <persName>Shiahs</persName>, etc., but he
                        was not using them at this time. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                            >Harriman</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2"
                            >Talbot</persName> encouraged the Shah in a policy of restraint toward
                        the Arab nations. The Governor added that strength for Iran obviously needs
                        to be based first on social and economic modernization. He hoped the Shah
                        would always keep his military outlay in balance with these other
                        objectives. The Shah said this was his intention.</p>
                    <p>A brief discussion of the situations in various Arab countries developed no
                        new points.</p>
                    <p>The Shah spoke of relations with his close neighbors along the Soviet
                        periphery. The Governor noted that the King of Afghanistan had been warm in
                        his comments about the Shah. The Shah recalled the assistance Iran had given
                        to Afghanistan and suggested he would like to strengthen their relationship,
                        “even though I don't understand how a country can call itself neutral,” he
                        said “we must protect Afghanistan's neutrality against Soviet pressures.”
                        The Shah expressed his desire to help persuade Ayub of Pakistan to be
                        careful in his dealings with Communist China. He said that he was broadening
                        Iran's relations with India, now through cooperation in oil extraction and
                        in the future perhaps in such things as aluminum. Looking westward, the Shah
                        expressed concern about the mood in Turkey, which he found badly shaken by
                        the Turkish inability to get a favorable solution to the Cyprus issue.</p>
                    <p>The Governor and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        congratulated the Shah on escaping harm when the attempted assassination
                        occurred on the night after the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        delegates had dined with the Shah. The Shah described the incident as a near
                        thing and expressed his concern at the Communist encouragement of Iranian
                        students in Western countries, particularly in Germany, Austria and Great
                        Britain. He identified the assassination ring as developed and directed by
                        students in Britain.</p>
                    <p>In the middle of the conversation, the President telephoned the Shah from
                            Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d85">Document
                                85</ref>.</note> It was clear that the Shah greatly appreciated this
                        gesture of friendship and interest. The President asked the Shah to take an

                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Hello?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Hello</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Your Majesty, how are you?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Mr. President, I'm so glad to hear you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Well, it's wonderful to hear your voice, and we're
                        so happy to have you and the Empress back in our country again, even if it's
                        very brief.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Yes. Unfortunately, we could not pay you our
                        respects.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Oh, I would like so much to see you. I was, oh, so
                        relieved, though, that you escaped the recent attempt. You know from your
                        own role at the time of President Kennedy's, what a shock such an experience
                        is.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Yes, it was rather close this time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Well, we were so pleased that you were so well
                        received in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Yes, they have been very nice to us. And I hope
                        that this is a new era between our part of the world and this continent of
                        South America.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: I sure hope so. Did you pick up any interesting
                        reactions to our handling of the Dominican crisis or Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Oh, well, I think that all of them in their inner
                        heart were in favor of it. Some of them dared to say so openly and some
                        others refrained to. But I suppose they all agree in their inner hearts.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Well, we certainly are grateful to you for your
                        Dominican and Vietnamese position, and I'm very concerned that the
                        Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers next month will degenerate. I'm afraid it
                        will be an anti-US operation unless some responsible delegation like Iran
                        stands up against these steamrollers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Yes. We shall do our duty, and we are grateful to
                        you to have taken this attitude, Mr. President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Well, we have to take this when our liberty is at
                        stake—</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Oh, yes.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>:—and I'm going to be anxious to have Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> report his talk with
                        you, and if you have any suggestions for me, let me know, and please give
                        Mrs. Johnson's high regards to the Empress and yourself. We look forward to
                        seeing you before too long.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Thank you very much. Would you please be kind
                        enough as to give Mrs. Johnson our best regards?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: We enjoyed our visit in your home so much. You
                        don't know how much it meant to both of us and how close we feel to both of
                        you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Well, we have the best of recollections, really,
                        of your visit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Everyone tells me you have just made phenomenal
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Yes. We have been very lucky.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: Well, no. You've been very courageous, that's
                        what. And the very best of everything to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: Thank you, Mr. President, I wish you all the
                        success.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: You tell Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                            >Harriman</persName> I want him to report to me. Y'all talk
                        confidentially [about] every problem you have so I can get a full
                        report.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: All right, thank you very much.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>LBJ</persName>: And I look forward to—you help us out in Algiers
                        now and you get on top of that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>MRP</persName>: All right. Thank you very much.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> briefly reviewed the

                            >Harriman</persName>'s April 28 memorandum for the Special Group (<gloss

                            Airgram A–81 from Tehran, August 22, 1964, containing the Embassy's

                            IRAN.</note> saying that there is essentially no great change and that
                        the situation has vastly improved despite recent assassination attempts on
                        the Shah. He said that there is always danger of assassination of high level
                        officials in Iran but that there are no indications of major plots to
                        threaten the regime. He informed the Group that local internal security
                        forces have improved their ability to handle internal security situations
                        and that the Army has enough personnel trained in counter-insurgency to
                        begin training themselves.</p>
                    <p>He briefly reviewed some of the reform programs such as the Literacy Corps,
                        female emancipation and administrative and fiscal reforms. He said that the
                        Youth Program is progressing well but that there is a shortage of operating
                        funds for the Student Center. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                            >Bell</persName> and <persName>Anderson</persName> said that <hi

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> concluded by saying that
                        no new actions by the Special Group are called for and suggested that in
                        light of the current stability of Iran the requirement for semi-annual
                        progress reports on the <gloss target="#t_IDP1">IDP</gloss> be suspended and
                        reports be submitted on an ad hoc basis. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> representatives did
                        not concur, stating that the police have probably improved but are not yet
                        capable of handling a situation such as that of June 1963; also there is
                        unrest among the ethnic minorities. <hi rend="italic">The Group agreed with
                            the Chairman's recommendation that, since there is a new Ambassador in
                            Iran, he be asked to submit one more report by October 1, together with
                            his recommendation on further reporting.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Chairman reported that in his discussions with the Shah on Tuesday, the
                        Shah had expressed concern over student activities. The Shah said that he
                        had evidence that the recent attempt on his life was planned by students
                        recently returned from England. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2"
                            >Jernegan</persName> informed the Group that the Shah's information is
                        from an Iranian source, but we do agree that students are involved.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> pointed out that
                        there are indications of Chinese Communist influence among the students in
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> brought the attention of the
                        Group to the recent report of a Youth Committee Survey Team asking if not
                        more could be done in this field. <hi rend="italic">The Chairman suggested
                            that the Interdepartmental Youth Committee <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154"

                    <p>In reply to a question by the Chairman, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                            >Bell</persName> explained that the phase-out of <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss> in Iran, tentatively scheduled for <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        out.</p>
                    <p>The Director of Central Intelligence asked if there is a contingency plan on
                        what should be done in case the Shah is removed from the scene, and if there
                        is one, is it adequate? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                            >Holmes</persName> replied that there has been a contingency study. He
                        said there are constitutional provisions for a regent, but not for a regency
                        council, and that it has been suggested that perhaps there could be a
                        council of advisers for the Prince, acting as regent, until such time as he
                        reached his majority. He reported that he had discussed this subject with
                        the Shah but nothing specific has been done. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed
                            that the Ambassador should be requested to bring this contingency study
                            up-to-date.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Director of Central Intelligence asked if there is any new action that we
                        should take to expedite and support such programs as Youth, Literacy Corps,
                        and land reform, etc. <hi rend="italic">The Group agreed with the Chairman's
                            recommendation that the Ambassador be asked to observe these programs
                            closely to insure that all steps are being taken to improve their
                            effectiveness.</hi>

                    <p>The Director of Central Intelligence stated that he would like to have the

                            <item>Shah asked us to lift the $200 million ceiling to $230m. to raise
                                war reserve ammo from 30 to 60 days. Our military go along with this
                                (Greece, Turkey, 90 days; Korea, Thailand, China, small arms 90,
                                other 60; Pakistan, India 60). However, decision recommended in this
                                cable is to go ahead with the ammo but not raise the ceiling yet.
                                Since this $90 million brings two-year total to about $140 million,
                                we'll be pressing the ceiling well before five years. Embassy says
                                greatly improved revenue prospects warrant slight increase in
                                ceiling. But leaving it intact now maximizes our leverage
                                later.</item>

                                The planes will be the toughest to handle, and there's some thought

                        <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> feels the economic review this spring
                        was a major step forward. Iranians worked from sound economic projections
                        for the first time. The Shah is still working on the principle of putting
                        hardware above everything else, but <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                        feels this is the resurrection of a useful economic dialogue.</p>
                    <p>So while the Shah is probably pushing reasonable economic ceilings, we may
                        make progress by going along on the war reserve and force level in order to
                        drag our feet on less reasonable requests. Any objection to the

                        ambitious development program, there is probably little we can do directly

                        worked out approach outlined below, which we believe sufficiently responsive

                        control and growth of the economy demand action as urgently as do military
                        requirements. Believe presentation to Shah should be designed: (1) avoid any

                        opportunity offered by annual review procedure to interest Shah further in

                    <p>We realize discussion this subject with Shah must proceed slowly and
                        carefully. Although projections on which Shah bases optimistic plans for

                        respects, we recognize little advantage debating merits these projections
                        with Shah. Trouble could well ensue if Iran accelerates volume public
                        expenditures at rates foreseen without commensurate increases public

                        Since qualitative discussions economic projections apt appear academic to

                        not come about automatically merely because resources available, but will

                    <p>The President was delighted with the Shah's understanding interest in the
                        Algiers conference when they discussed it in the brief but gratifying
                        telephone chat at the time of the Shah's stop in New York.<note n="2"

                    </p>
                    <p>The President notes that the prospects of the forthcoming conference of Asian
                        and African leaders in Algiers have struck some of our friends with dismay,
                        but he is encouraged by the constructive efforts which Iran is making to the
                        end that the responsible voices of Asia and Africa may have a full and
                        effective hearing at Algiers. The President is impressed to learn from
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> that Iran will seek
                        to focus the main attention of the Asian-African conference on a
                        consideration of ways and means of improving the social and economic
                        conditions of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The President hopes that other
                        responsible delegations will recognize the wisdom of this conception of the
                        “Afro-Asian movement” and not fall prey to those forces of confusion and
                        subversion which cynically seek to betray the deeply felt longings of Asians
                        and Africans to enjoy the fruits of independence and human dignity.</p>
                    <p>The President sees hopeful signs that more and more leaders of Africa and
                        Asia are learning to distinguish their real interests from the lure of
                        slogans and the transitory satisfactions of belaboring the phantoms of
                        ancient animosities. The kind of leadership and example Your Majesty is
                        giving has already done a great deal to bring awareness of these lessons to
                        other governments. If other responsible delegations at Algiers recognize how
                        much may be gained from coordination of their efforts with their real
                        friends, the conference will have a more constructive atmos-phere than some
                        of our friends have feared. So the President hopes that the Iranian
                        Delegation will provide leadership to this end.</p>
                    <p>The President expresses again how much it meant to him to be able to have
                        that all so brief chat with the Shah. The Shah's friendship, understanding,
                            <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>and support are of the greatest
                        importance to President Johnson personally and to the American nation in
                        these difficult days.</p>
                    <p>The President sends the warmest good wishes to the Shah and the Imperial
                        family.</p>

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGS1">Eckhardt</persName> and I had two and
                        three-quarter hr session with Shah 17th formally reviewing econ-military
                        picture pursuant to US-Iran Memorandum of Understanding of July 4. Shah was
                        in good mood, no major problems developed. He went along with our various
                        positions (Deptel 1124) except that he wishes one squadron F–5's equipped
                        with Bullpups. <persName>Gen Eckhardt</persName> who ably handled discussion
                        military procurement is writing up memo for record<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d90fn3">Not found.</note> of understandings reached which will
                        be supplied to Shah for his approval prior to his departure for <gloss

                        reported by separate message.</p>
                    <p>Nearly hr was spent re econ framework. I led off by reiterating econ
                        development is as important as military. Noted Iran has excellent income but
                        also large deficits projected for future. Added Shah's reform programs apt
                        to add to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> financial burden and cautioned
                        unless rising expectations met frustration of Iran masses could cause real
                        problem. Concluded that while redoubled effort is going to be required in
                        econ filed over long run, prospects for immediate future satisfactory and,
                        therefore, we prepared proceed with second tranche of military program.</p>
                    <p>Shah then expatiated at length. First he expressed his personal cynicism re
                        economists, noting Iran has had sad experiences with experts <pb n="162"
                            xml:id="pg_162" facs="0190"/>who claim to know all answers and who
                        disagree among themselves. Happily Iran econ situation has now recovered
                        from handiwork these economists. He particularly pleased by what he
                        considers overwhelmingly favorable impact of his recent attack high cost
                        living thru setting prices for certain basic commodities. He confident his
                        reform programs will greatly improve welfare Iran masses, e.g. by increased
                        production from farms which they now own and by sharing profits from
                        expanding industrial sector. Meanwhile, great strides being made
                            <persName>Khuzistan</persName> and elsewhere. Thus in general picture
                        good one.</p>
                    <p>From this point, Shah launched into his usual contention that this future
                        prosperity meaningless if Iran not secure. He simply has been able cope with
                        regional threats. Viet Nam is graphic example, according Shah, of what could
                        happen Iran. U.S. despite its might now compelled seek “unconditional
                        discussions,” which Shah means negotiating with and making concession to
                        aggressor. He went on to express concern re future of Kuwait, Aden and
                        Bahrain. He believes Nasser frustrated in Yemen and elsewhere bound to
                        launch adventure some where, probably against Libya, much less probably
                        against Israel. Nasserist threat in <persName>Gulf</persName> area cannot be
                        ignored.</p>
                    <p>Thus his principal foreign policy consideration is safety and security
                            <persName>Gulf</persName> area where Iran's wealth concentrated. He said
                        no responsible leader facing threat this kind can afford be too cautious.
                        After seeking downplay Nasserist threat, I pointed out threat very likely be
                        more subversive (as in Viet Nam) than open military attack. Thus more attn
                        to counter-insurgency was desirable. Shah recognized this and said that his
                        interest in counter-subversion explains his emphasis on total “positive
                        program.” He cited new dams being built in <persName>Khuzistan</persName>
                        and other efforts toward econ and social improvement.</p>
                    <p>After he had delivered himself of remarks obviously previously planned, Shah
                        agreed my summation that he and his govt are determined accelerate econ
                        progress and that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will dedicate its
                        resources to extent necessary to achieve that objective.</p>

                            U.S.-IRAN)</note> In accordance 1962 agreement, personnel of Iranian
                        Armed Forces had to be reduced to 160,000 “within two or three years.” This
                        was achieved March 1, 1965. However, events subsequent to 1962 have, in our
                        view, made a higher ceiling necessary. Based on the following
                        considerations, Country Team therefore again recommends that ceiling be
                        established at 172,000 for period of 1964 Memorandum of Understanding. We
                        consider such ceiling necessary to success of modernization program.</p>
                    <p>Principal reason for need to increase ceiling is fact that July 4, 1964
                        Understanding provides for additional equipment and units which must be
                        manned and supported. In particular additional personnel requirements are
                        necessary for new airborne battalion, <persName>Hawk battalion</persName>,
                        increased number of aircraft, <gloss target="#t_ACW1">AC&amp;W</gloss>
                        equipment, additional tanks and reorganization of 8th Armor Division, new
                        patrol frigates and other equipment.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <gloss target="#t_IIF1">IIF</gloss> has undertaken greater
                        responsibilities in connection Literacy, Health and Development Corps and
                        vocational training program. These responsibilities, added to requirements
                        for modernization program, render 1962 personnel ceiling obsolete.</p>
                    <p>ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IIF1"
                            >IIF</gloss> have completed comprehensive and detailed joint study of
                        manpower requirements, including TOES/TDS. Study encompassed all
                        possibilities reducing non-essential units while instituting modernization
                        program. Starting point of study was <gloss target="#t_IIF1">IIF</gloss>
                        estimate of 188,000 for new ceiling. As result of study, this figure reduced
                        to 172,000, and Shah has reluctantly concurred in lower figure. It could be
                        reached by yearly increments through 1969. We do not think further personnel
                        survey necessary. ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will continue
                        insure ceiling reflects essential requirements. Stress will be placed on
                        bringing only trained manpower into regular forces and elimination of unfit
                        from present personnel.</p>
                    <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0192"/>
                    <p>In conclusion, as stated above and in A–590, we believe ceiling of 172,000
                        justified and necessary and recommend its approval.<note n="5"

                    <p>9. Shah's Trip to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. During Fourth of
                        July reception today <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> told me
                        briefly that Shah's trip to U.S.S.R. had been extremely interesting and
                        marked by unusual warmth of reception. There were many discussions but no
                        important substantive decisions were taken. Specifically, no final decision
                        was taken about possibility of Soviets constructing steel mill here,
                        although Soviet Ambassador quoted in press this morning as saying U.S.S.R.
                        ready to go ahead if Iran will agree. <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> said this matter would be further explored with
                        Soviets.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> stated that Shah had explained
                        and defended U.S. policy in Viet-nam “even better than President Johnson.”
                        This had made Russians very angry. They had pressed hard to have their point
                        of view on Viet-nam included in final communique, and when Iranians refused,
                        discussion of communique almost terminated. I thanked <persName

                            particularly heartened by the Shah's strong stand on Vietnam and asked

                    <p>244. In nearly two and half hour session thirty-first, Shah told me he has
                        been spending many sleepless hours meditating re orientation Iran's
                        policies. These meditations obviously sparked by his recent visit to Moscow.
                        Highlights of this discussion follow: <list>

                            <item>US friendship. Shah gratified by personal greetings from President
                                and Secretary which I conveyed. He said his pronouncements in
                                support of our Viet Nam policy based on friendship for US and even
                                more on his conviction in principles.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Viet Nam and US. Shah pleased by firm U.S. policy re Viet Nam. He
                                convinced situation is taking turn for better. Soviets, he believes,
                                anxious to avoid escalation to major confrontation. He admits,
                                however, that Chinese not peace-minded.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Viet Nam and Soviets. When Soviet leaders expressed horror at
                                American bombing attacks in North Viet Nam, Shah pointed out if Viet
                                Nam falls to Chinese, rest of Southeast Asia including Indonesia
                                will also fall under Chinese control. Shah also alluded to
                                Soviet-supported activities by Nasser in Yemen. Soviets, he says,
                                made little effort to defend Chinese or themselves re Yemen. Shah
                                confirms Soviet-Chinese rift is deep. It was particularly evident
                                when he needled Soviets about question their being invited to
                                Algiers Conference.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Soviets' southern neighbors. Shah tried to write off current
                                Soviet attention to Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan as
                                “series of coincidences.” He contended that Soviet friendliness
                                toward these countries is not something new; they tried in 1965, at
                                which time they asked him to intercede with Turks for better
                                relations. Major Soviet purpose, according to Shah is to have
                                friendly cordon of states around Soviet Union so U.S.S.R. can get
                                ahead with its major task of developing its economy. He added,
                                however, there undoubtedly is added incentive for Soviets of
                                rallying as many non-yellow countries as possible behind Soviets in
                                long-term struggle with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"

                            <item>Stand-on-own-feet policy. Shah's central theme was that Iran must
                                stand on its own feet, militarily and economically. “Intervention”
                                by outsiders is increasingly outmoded, he said. In maintaining
                                Iran's independence vis-a-vis Soviets no one (not even Americans)
                                could be more “patriotic” than Iranians, he added.</item>

                            <item>“Moribund” <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. In most
                                disparaging description he has yet made of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                                    >CENTO</gloss>, he described it as “moribund” and as
                                “masquerade” that meets to little effect every six months, although
                                he mused “we better keep it.” When Soviets said they did not like
                                    <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, he told them he would
                                be glad to see it terminated when all other pacts are terminated,
                                e.g. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                                    <persName>Warsaw</persName>, etc. He said he told Soviets they

                            <item>Soviet-Iran non-aggression pact. Shah said Soviets proposed to him
                                an un-registered “non-aggression pact for 200 years.” He had turned
                                conversation aside and has “not yet” given Soviets an answer. He
                                wondered whether having such a treaty might not serve Iran's
                                purposes by assuring that Soviets would spare Iran if world-tensions
                                break out in hostilities. When Soviets had made proposal of this
                                kind in 1959, he had turned it down, mostly because U.S. and U.K.
                                urged him to reject it. Note: This is first indication Embassy has
                                had of this proposal. In interests maintaining dialogue with Shah,
                                Embassy hopes there will be no leakage.</item>

                            <item>Regional entente. Commenting that Afghan policy seems to be
                                successful, Shah at one point mentioned possibility Iran,
                                Afghanistan, and Pakistan getting together in common policy of
                                independence.</item>

                                        Khuzistan. Ambassador <persName>Wallace Murray</persName>
                                        had been commissioned to bring him this unhappy news. Note:

                                    <item>While U.S. economic aid has been deeply appreciated,
                                        virtually all of it has been extended only after agonizing
                                        wrangling. Specifically, Americans sabotaged British-German
                                        steel mill project seven years ago. President
                                            <persName>Eisenhower</persName> spoke to Shah sneeringly
                                        of countries insisting on having “damn steel mills.”
                                        Friendly countries like Iran naturally are bitter when they
                                        see American critics like Nasser and India receiving aid on
                                        more generous terms and at time when aid to Iran is being
                                        curtailed.</item>

                                    <item>Similarly Shah deeply appreciative of U.S. military aid
                                        but there have been many delays and continued resistance
                                        even when he is obtaining it through purchase. He said he
                                        has only recently realized that loans for military equipment
                                        are not on favorable basis. Meanwhile, while Iran has

                            <item>Therapy. Several times underscoring our impressive record of
                                friendship and help for Iran. I sought to straighten Shah up at
                                various appropriate points including such arguments as: a) since
                                Iran increasingly becoming model for progress in Mideast it would be
                                sad for Iran and for free world if its leadership now tries to
                                follow a route taken by leadership in countries not doing so well;
                                b) since as <persName>Dean Acheson</persName> once said treaties are
                                mere pieces of paper registering an existing situation there is no
                                assurance that piece of paper would deter Soviets from over-running
                                Iran if they felt impelled to do so; c) masses of Afro-Asia
                                including Iran take their cue from on high and tend to stampede in
                                direction leadership points them and leadership then no longer in
                                control; d) as <persName>Dulles</persName> once said at <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> meeting US aid is limited and
                                is not reward for good behavior but is deployed where it can do most
                                good in life-and-death struggle between free world and slave; e)
                                Shah's great strength has been that he is man of principle and this
                                is no time for him to shirk the principles which both our countries
                                uphold. I specifically discouraged any moves toward dismantling
                                    <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> or toward non-aggression

                                some lift when I told of how home leave was valuable in reassuring
                                me that American system can outstrip any other, e.g. burgeoning
                                business and industry establishments in Manhattan where Shah also
                                had been amazed by new construction, verdant prairies of central
                                Illinois which producing more food than ever, and Gemini 5 space
                                feat which gives indication that we ready compete with Soviets even

                        way for possible shift in his future policy. Also obviously his talks with
                        Soviet leaders have made marked impression. He may be in one of those moods

                        me about. Hopefully he can surmount it without going too far toward Soviets.
                        Meanwhile, our attention must be as cordial and cooperative as possible
                        without being panicky.</p>

                            <ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note> In discussion eighth Shah
                        remarked that Soviet economic delegation currently visiting Tehran is
                        manifesting almost unbelievable cordiality. This followed cordiality he
                        (Shah) had experienced during his recent Moscow visit when Soviets offered
                        200-year non-aggression pact and MIG aircraft. Shah had not responded to
                        these two Soviet offers but he said he could not help wondering whether he
                        should not be more responsive to Soviet offers, particularly since his
                        generally pro-Western orientation seemed to be having less value. He noted
                        Ayub finding <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> membership useless. As
                        for himself, he had only recently realized when there was an alarm re an air
                        attack by Iraqis that Iran has no early warning or other anti-aircraft
                        equipment. He said Iran's airfields and aircraft could be wiped out in one
                        raid. Current attention, he said, is being given to dispersal of
                        aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Referring to well-known Soviet objectives vis-a-vis Iran, I pointed out what
                        Shah had termed “Soviet smiles” were clearly tactical. He should give
                        credit, I said, to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> for deterring
                        Soviet bully tactics and compelling Soviets to be more friendly.</p>

                        sensitive installations in Iran, I have visited a sufficient number to be
                        tremendously impressed by what is already being accomplished here. I wonder
                        if many authorities in Washington are aware of the extensiveness of our
                        sensitive operations here by <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified]</hi>, Army, Navy, Air Force, etc. (some of them
                        of a duplicating nature).</p>
                    <p>My conclusion is that there is little being done in Pakistan that is not
                        already being done adequately here. Under these circumstances, piling on an
                        additional <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified]</hi> Americans atop <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified]</hi> in Iran (not counting dependents)
                        would in my view be inconsonant with President Johnson's injunctions re
                        economy in government.</p>
                    <p>The importance of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> facilities is their
                        geography. They afford an additional bearing on target areas. This advantage
                        cannot be transplanted to Iran where bearings are already being taken.
                        Unless someone can demonstrate otherwise to me, transferred personnel from
                        Pakistan will be able to do very little more than is already being done in
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of source text not declassified]</hi>
                        communications, I find that both <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified]</hi> already have first-class
                        installations. Obviously any radio man, and I am one myself, is always
                        dreaming of a more extensive antenna system. But as far as I can see both
                            <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified]</hi> are handling traffic with maximum speed and
                        effectiveness. For neither system is volume of traffic more than one-third
                        its capacity.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> who visited Tehran last
                        week agrees that proposed site at <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified]</hi> for <hi rend="italic">[less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified]</hi> is unsuitable for various
                        reasons. He would like to find more favorable location. He concurs that
                        until that day is reached an extension of present <hi rend="italic">[less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified]</hi> site is required. It
                        is adequate, if not ideal. I favor indefinite stay at present location.</p>
                    <p>Foregoing conclusions reached even without political considerations. As
                        recent Embassy telegrams have confirmed, Iran is in process of <pb n="173"
                            xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>adjusting its foreign policy so as to avoid
                        image of being “American stooges.” Basically Shah and his government will
                        continue to be with U.S.. At same time, from standpoint of keeping them in
                        power, we must understand value of their improving their image.
                        Nationalistic sentiment is virulent in most of Africa and Asia. It is on
                        upswing in Iran, particularly as Pakistan <hi rend="italic">[less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified]</hi> loosen their ties with us.
                        Sensitive U.S. operations here as well as burgeoning US official presence
                        are tailor-made targets for anti-Shah and/or anti-American elements. If such
                        elements were to succeed in stirring up passions against US and Shah
                        remained cooperative with U.S., his own future would be in jeopardy. If he
                        responded to popular sentiment, which he would probably be forced to do, it
                        would mean ouster of great bulk of American presence here, including our
                        existing sensitive operations.</p>
                    <p>Since we already have well established facilities <hi rend="italic">[1 line
                            of source text not declassified]</hi>, I think it would be most unwise
                        to tempt fate by importing additional hundreds of Americans. Camel's back is
                        already heavy laden, from standpoint of what is politically tolerable here.
                        Why risk destroying extensive facilities already in being for minimal
                        additional product?</p>
                    <p>While recommending against transfer of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        facilities or any substantial part of them to Iran either now or in
                        foreseeable future. I do not preclude squeezing in an extra technician or so
                        in facilities already established here. I am impressed by present efficiency
                        and compactness of these facilities. My vote goes for keeping them that
                        way.</p>

                        additional problems in Iran. We now face, however, the possibility of
                        exclusion from Pakistan at short notice and even if we weather the present
                        crisis, the future viability of the facilities there is in grave doubt. Our
                        job is to try to determine (A) what could be done in Iran right now should
                        we suddenly be excluded from Pakistan and (B) what can be done in the months
                        ahead to prepare the way for a more gradual transfer of at least some of the
                        activities now carried out in Pakistan to Iran.</p>

                            tension, Shah is badgering us re West's lack of appreciation his
                            friendship. He appears to be shifting Iranian policy so as to reduce his
                            image as “American stooge” and give impression Iran has “independ-ent”
                            policy more consonant with mainstream of Afro-Asian nationalism. His
                            subjects, taking cue not without some relief, inevitably tend to swing
                            too far. There is current trend in government circles, press and public
                            opinion treat Western interests much more critically and coolly. While
                            both Shah's shift and public allergy been developing over long period of
                            time, they have developed markedly within past six months, and most
                            specifically after red carpet treatment he received in Moscow. Much of
                            this change is rooted in series of grievances re which Iran has felt
                            lack of US attention.</item>

                        <item>Need for total policy. From my own experience, I know how Washington
                            is compartmentalized. Issues between U.S. and Iran during recent months
                            been handled pretty much without full realization their effect on total
                            U.S.-Iran relationship. Impression around Washington is Iran is now
                            “rich” country and, therefore, we can shift our attention elsewhere. As
                            a result, most of these individual issues have not received sympathy in
                            Washington which Shah and Iranians feel they deserved. <pb n="177"

                                <item>Military Aid. Shah has become increasingly resentful re our
                                    military aid program. While extending grant aid to countries
                                    less faithful to our cause than Iran, we are requiring him to
                                    pay for high percentage his procurement from us. We agreed on
                                    4–5 percent interest and promptly applied 5 percent rate. He
                                    must repay in dollars. (Meanwhile Soviets are offering steel
                                    mill, and MIGs, at much lower rate with repayment in Iranian
                                    products.) There are other aspects of our military program which
                                    because of their restrictive nature tend to offend Shah's
                                    sensitive pride but they stem from our legislation and there is
                                    little we can do about them, e.g. limitation on his helping

                        morning is to make a big splash over the 25th anniversary of the Shah's
                        coming to the throne.<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Shortly before noon on
                            September 16 in the Oval Office, President Johnson presented Iranian
                            Ambassador Khosro <persName corresp="#p_KK1">Khosrovani</persName> with
                            a message and gift for the Shah commemorating the 25th anniversary of
                            his accession to the throne. For text of the message, see Public Papers
                            of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"

                    </p>
                    <p>While the Shah didn't compromise much of his pro-Western virtue in Moscow,
                        the Soviets made handsome enough offers (steel mill, non-aggression pact) to
                        start the Shah worrying again. He's stood foursquare behind us on Vietnam,
                        but <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> is sure he's worried by our
                        seemingly slow progress there. He doesn't want to become another Diem, and
                        whenever he worries about his destiny he begins to see rust on his westward
                        anchor. So this, like your call to him in New York, is mostly massage.</p>
                    <p>However, you could add a specific touch by asking the ambassador to relay
                        your thanks for Iranian help with American evacuees from Lahore. Also, the
                        Shah has just gone out on a legal limb to grant clemency to an American who
                        got wound up in the Iranian courts and was recently sentenced. So a word of
                        thanks for this personal favor in the “Bredin case” would be a nice
                        touch.</p>

                        previously reported, Shah has become increasingly unhappy with his virtually
                        complete dependence on U.S. for military supplies. He considers there have
                        been intolerable delays, too much back-seat driving “from 10,000 miles
                        away“, undesirable gaps such as in air defense, and discrimination in sense
                        that Iran, one of few Afro-Asian countries to support us in foreign policy
                        matters (like Viet Nam), is forced to pay for its supplies on virtually
                        commercial basis while other less friendly nations receive both military and
                        economic aid at more generous terms. Just prior to Central Bank Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName>'s departure for U.S. to
                        negotiate financing of “second tranche.” Shah was startled to learn that
                        while our agreement envisaged interest terms between four and five percent
                        we at outset immediately jumped to five per cent figure.</p>
                    <p>With this background, a crowning irritation for Shah has been discovery that
                        when he wanted to send token military help to Pakistan to assist Iran
                        maintain dialogue with Ayub during recent Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> crisis, U.S.G. bluntly and categorically put its foot down,
                        not just re <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> supplied hardware but also
                        supplies purchased via U.S.G. guaranteed credit and even straight sales
                        which require <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> licensing. In bitter tone,
                        he spoke exasperatedly to PriMin <persName corresp="#p_HAA1"
                            >Hoveyda</persName> in front of me, “We are not free.” When signing
                        various military agreements with U.S., Shah was, of course, aware
                        restrictions incorporated. They were, however, at time somewhat academic.
                        Now full meaning has come sharply to his realization. This comes at time
                        when in general foreign policy is tending toward move designed to alter what
                        he considers his “American stooge” image in Afro-Asian world.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt in my mind Shah will make definite effort to decrease his
                        military dependence on US. In fact, there is already evidence coming to
                        Embassy that he intends to do it promptly. He will be seeking procurement
                        from non-American sources. Even Iranian procurement from Soviets cannot be
                        ruled out (Shah has told me Soviets offered him MIGs during his recent
                        Moscow sojourn).</p>
                    <p>While we may not be able completely to forestall Shah's move to loosen his
                        military cooperation ties with U.S. (including <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>), there is much to be said for our maintaining that
                        cooperation to the maximum <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0210"/>extent
                        possible. Certainly we should seek to avoid having pendulum swing too far in
                        other direction. With this end in view Embassy once again appeals to <gloss
                            target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        to conjure up some means (perhaps through appropriate component of <gloss

                        “second tranche” purchases as close as possible to four percent figure.</p>
                    <p>In addition to <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName>, Iran FinMin
                        Amuzegue also now in Washington. Advising them that more favorable terms
                        have been arranged would do great deal to shore up our position in Iran,
                        specifically as far as military cooperation is concerned.</p>

                        welcome its words of wisdom. I am wholly in agreement with you that the
                        resolution of the Security Council obliges all of us to seek a settlement of
                        the underlying political problems that divide those two great nations.</p>
                    <p>The firm policy of the United States Government is to search for a peaceful
                        settlement between the two countries through the United Nations which is the
                        instrument we have agreed should act in these matters. We stand ready to
                        lend our best efforts through the Security Council to assist as we can. As
                        you and I are well aware, this task will not be easy. The issues between
                        India and Pakistan have resisted solution for some <pb n="183"
                            xml:id="pg_183" facs="0211"/>eighteen years already, and I hope that the
                        recent fighting has not made them harder rather than easier to resolve.</p>
                    <p>I am aware of and admire the statesmanlike roles played by Your Majesty,
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>, and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> in support of the
                        successful efforts of the United Nations to achieve a cease-fire. Your
                        thoughts on how we can move forward to lasting peace as relayed by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> have been
                        interesting and useful. It is clear to us that as the United Nations seeks
                        solution to the problem, Iran can provide constructive support by
                        encouraging and strengthening Pakistan's ties to the Free World.</p>
                    <p>Because of our deep mutual interest in a stable subcontinent, I look forward
                        to continued close consultations and exchanges of views with you as India
                        and Pakistan seek, with the help of the United Nations, a solution to the

                            >Dated October 22. (Ibid., POL 23–1 COL)</note> Threat of insurgency in
                        Iran is in latent rather than active stage. Thus, our efforts and those of
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> are directed as much towards
                        prevention as towards improving capability to deal with insurgency if it
                        occurs. Overall US objective in Iran (preservation this country from
                        domination by elements inimical to US interests) is at present best served
                        by furthering progress already made in economic, social and political
                        development while recognizing that Shah represents vital element of
                        stability. Thus, our unremitting efforts are directed toward development and
                        implementation number courses of action many of which have
                        counter-insurgency implications.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> authorities, from Shah down through
                        military, security, and police echelons, are all aware of importance
                        counter-insurgency operations, <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0212"/>and
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has improved its posture by
                        launching own programs in fields of health and sanitation, literacy, land
                        reform, vocational training and civic action. Since inauguration civic
                        action programs in Iran (1962) there has been noteworthy change in public
                        image of Iranian military and gendarmerie and attitude of general public
                        toward gendarmerie and military has altered visibly for better; similar
                        changes have taken place in attitude military toward civilian population.
                        Civic action thus has played material role in decline of insurgency threat
                        and pacification of tribes.</p>
                    <p>Greatest danger to stability, as brought out by events of this year, comes
                        from small groups of fanatics who might assassinate Shah but who have no
                        significant capability for insurgency themselves. (Embassy's A–105)<note

                            23–1 IRAN)</note> However, this is not insurgency problem but tied to
                        personality of Shah. In short while due attention is given by Country Team
                        to potential insurgency threats from tribes, mullahs, and dissatisfied urban
                        elements, Iran in my judgment is a situation where further refinement of
                        counter-insurgency programs is less important than encouraging
                        well-conceived economic development and broader based institutionalized
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Am satisfied with progress being made in Iranian counter-insurgency
                        preparations and at moment I see no major problems. This is why in our last
                        progress report on <gloss target="#t_IDP1">IDP</gloss> I recommended that
                        Iran be taken off special group list requiring periodic review. As reported
                        in Embassy's A–281 current situation here better than it has been for some
                        time.</p>
                    <p>However, in our regular and continuing process of analysis Iranian political
                        environment we are, of course, constantly alert to any signs of increase in
                        counter-insurgency threat or its potential. I am fully aware of advantages
                        for prompt attention at highest levels <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        which special group provides and would seek assistance promptly this channel
                        should changing conditions here seem to justify.</p>
                    <p>I regard our <gloss target="#t_IDP1">IDP</gloss> as adequate and geared to
                        Iran's present requirements. I consider that I have authority to utilize all
                        resources of US agencies within mission to insure efficient execution of US
                        responsibilities under <gloss target="#t_IDP1">IDP</gloss>. Country Team
                        fully effective in counter-insurgency field and there are no conflicts
                        between US agencies regarding roles and missions. I believe attitude of
                        local authorities towards insurgency threat is healthy one. <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> appears to be increasingly aware of
                        importance of counter-insurgency programs and local authorities are

                        <item>Build-up Urgent. In discussion with Eximbank President Linder and me
                            11th, Shah stressed once again that successful economic development of
                            Iran is useless unless Iran has adequate military security. Reiterating
                            many points made previously and those disclosed by FinMin Amuzegar 3
                            days ago, Shah made clear that in wake of Pak-Indian crisis and
                            procurement by Iraq of new MIGs and British aircraft he considers
                            augmentation his military establishment an urgent necessity. His fears
                            center particularly on vulnerability of Khuzistan and Kharg Island to
                                <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0214"/>surprise attack. He said he
                            realized US and Iran have agreement on military program but new facts
                            require additional $200,000,000 expenditures envisaged in request made
                            this week and approved by parliament.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>US-Iran Cooperation. Pointing to cooperative aspects of US-Iranian
                            military relationship, I said I felt we had formulated effective program
                            for Iran's military security as envisaged in our respective agreements,
                            latest being that of July 1964. If there were certain weaknesses which
                            required amendment it struck me they should be worked out by
                                ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief <persName

                        <item>Alleged Delays. Shah said problem is delay. He said he had been
                            waiting two months for paperwork to be completed re second tranche
                            including determination of interest rate. It not possible with urgency
                            facing him militarily to countenance such delays. I assured him that
                            delay of second tranche paperwork in no way deliberate nor with ulterior
                            motive. Meanwhile, as General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                                >Jablonsky</persName> has already assured him, we been meeting time
                            schedule for our commitments with remarkable success.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Anti-aircraft needs. Shah stressed his anxiety over lack of air
                            defense. He asserted that U.S.G. itself considered certain anti-aircraft
                            guns obsolete and pursuant to U.S. advice Iran disposed of them. Now,
                            however, he realizes that he needs such guns or others to defend his
                            defenseless installations. I noted that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName> had told him a week ago in
                            their monthly meeting that whole question of anti-aircraft weaponry is
                            under review in US as result of Viet Nam and some definitive decisions
                            expected in December. As he did to <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                                >Jablonsky</persName>, Shah said he would wait until December before
                            he makes any final decisions re this equipment. In talking with me,
                            however, he prefaced his statement emphatically with the word
                            “maybe”.</item>

                        <item>Unhappiness re Hawks. When I suggested that in long-range program Hawk
                            missiles were to play a key role in Iran's air defense, Shah virtually
                            exploded in complaining we are limiting him to one battalion. He said it
                            impossible to fragment one battalion and try to defend each of his
                            installations with only one or two Hawk launchers. In addition to his
                            irritation over fact that Iraqis, Egyptians and others have more and
                            faster planes, Shah voiced his unhappiness that Egypt already has eight
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites and that both his
                            neighbors Iraq and Afghanistan have such Russian equipment.</item>

                            misunderstanding, Shah said “It has been decided” that additional
                            $200,000,000 worth of urgent military equipment will be obtained. He
                            said he hoped bulk of it would be available from U.S. At same time he
                            gave indication that Iran will be shopping other places and said some
                            military training for Iranians is already planned for Germany.</item>

                        <item>Inadequate Human Resources. I took occasion once again to point out
                            inadequacy of trained human resources in Iran Armed Forces. I <pb
                                n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>said I concerned at prospect of
                            Iran importing more highly technical equipment, when already some
                            supplies not being handled properly. Shah acknowledged this deficiency
                            but asked for examples. This prompted further emphasis on my part that
                            his military and General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                                >Jablonsky</persName> should be in close consultation.<note n="2"

                    <p>743. Shah's Moodiness. FinMin Amuzegar evening 17th told me that following

                            n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Dated November 9. (Ibid., DEF 19–8
                            U.S.-IRAN)</note> he sought to explain to Shah valid reasons for delay
                        in US decision re second tranche interest rate. Amuzegar said he found Shah
                        unreceptive. According to Amuzegar, Shah is in glum mood, convinced that
                        Washington is determined to retaliate for his having made steel mill deal
                        with Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Amuzegar said that in addition to second tranche interest rate issue, Shah
                        cited “What Americans are doing to my brother and sister” in Gudarzian case.
                        According Amuzegar, Shah simply cannot conceive that top U.S.G. leadership
                        could not, if it really wanted to, secure prompt justice for Prince and
                        Princess.</p>
                    <p>I told Amuzegar that by coincidence two U.S.G. attorneys, Kearney and King,
                        presently in Tehran with purpose of explaining to Shah extent to which
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has gone to clear Prince and
                            Princess.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Telegram 759 from Tehran, November
                            20, reported that the Ambassador, Deputy Assistant Legal Adviser
                                <persName>Richard D. Kearney</persName>, and Assistant U.S. Attorney
                                <persName>Robert</persName> King had had a 1-hour audience with the
                            Shah that morning, during which they had emphasized that the U.S.
                            Government had expended great efforts in seeking to put Gudarzian in
                            jail but would not be able to proceed on fraud charges if <persName
                                corresp="#p_EAH1">Ebtehaj</persName> and Daftary were not available
                            as witnesses. The Shah expressed his inability to understand why the
                            American system of criminal justice could not convict Gudarzian of
                            forgery or perjury, but he did not indicate willingness to relieve
                                <persName corresp="#p_EAH1">Ebtehaj</persName>'s apprehensions about
                            testifying. (Ibid., POL 15–1 IRAN)</note> I noted it boils down <pb
                            n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>to our determination to have
                        Gudarzian locked up, but this requires necessary Iranian witnesses. Amuzegar
                        said this is precisely what irks Shah, who is convinced that <persName
                            corresp="#p_EAH1">Ebtehaj</persName>, as great and good friend of top
                        American leaders, would not fail to testify if that were truly U.S.G.'s
                        desire. Fact that <persName corresp="#p_EAH1">Ebtehaj</persName> has refused
                        can in Shah's view, according to Amuzegar, only mean that <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> really suggested <persName
                            corresp="#p_EAH1">Ebtehaj</persName> not testify and all this is aimed
                        at making Shah squirm because of steel mill transaction.</p>
                    <p>Amuzegar emphasized that he himself realizes all this is pure moodiness on
                        part of Shah but it exists nevertheless. He pleaded that <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> make some gesture, as for example quick
                        word re second tranche interest rate, to help break intensified feeling Shah

                        measures against him. Amuzegar said Shah's belief that <gloss

                        influenced by his brooding over Pakistan's plight vis-à-vis U.S..</p>

                    <p>776. Shah and US. At outset Thanksgiving Day conversation, Shah agreed with
                        me that time had come for mutually frank discussion. Two-hour session
                        resulted with following highlights: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Incipient Divergence. Shah said he had uneasy feeling growing
                                estrangement between US and Iran. Agreeing, I said purpose my
                                audience was obtain better understanding Iran's policies and seek
                                provide him better understanding of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> problems.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Rehash of Grievances. Obviously planned, Shah rehashed what he
                                considers unhappy developments in U.S.-Iran relations. This time
                                instead of harking back to Azerbaijan days, he began with
                                mid-fifties and U.S. refusal join <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                                    >CENTO</gloss>. He also contended U.S.G. sought to dictate
                                Iran's policies from days of Gerry Dooher (who “wanted to be
                                Lawrence of Iran”) to Amini days of early sixties. He recalled
                                President Kennedy, during Shah's Washington visit in 1962, had gone
                                out of his way to inform Shah that U.S.G. had two favorite Prime
                                Ministers, Amini and Karamanlis. Amini's premiership had been
                                disastrous. Stating publicly Iran <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190"
                                    facs="0218"/>was bankrupt, Amini precipitated tremendous flight
                                of capital and economic depression. More recently U.S.G. has sought
                                to dictate in minutest detail what his military establishment may
                                and may not have. In all honesty he felt Iranian authorities here
                                are in best position to assess Iran's security needs.</item>

                            <item>Relations with Soviets. In rehashing grievances, Shah recalled how
                                in 1959 at insistence his Western allies he rejected offer of
                                non-aggression pact with Soviets. Subsequently whole world witnessed
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attempts to relax
                                relationship with Soviets. When Test Ban Treaty was signed, large
                                U.S. Congressional contingent appeared in Moscow with all sorts of
                                prophecies re new era in U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. It was only
                                natural, Shah said, that Iran would not want to be left out in cold.
                                Accordingly, Iran began probing Soviet expressions of interest in
                                relaxed Iran-U.S.S.R. relationship. Until now evidence is that
                                Soviet intentions are reasonably honorable. Accordingly, as long as
                                Soviets behave themselves, Shah said he sees no objection to
                                neighborliness particularly in economic field.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Steel Mill. Among grievances, of course, was long-standing Western
                                rejection of Iranian aspirations for steel mill. Shah said steel
                                mill had become dream of all Iranians, dramatic symbol of Iran's
                                movement into modern world. So when Soviets made attractive offer,
                                Shah accepted. He acknowledged recent active interest of Western
                                consortia but said their efforts were to no purpose for they could
                                not possibly compete with Soviet offer unless they would make gift
                                of steel mill. He was referring to his well-known thesis that by
                                paying for steel mill with natural gas, until now wasted by flaring,
                                Iran is in effect getting steel mill from Soviets for
                                nothing.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>U.S. Reactions to Steel Mill. I pointed out to Shah our
                                understanding of Iran's acceptance of steel mill. Realized it had
                                political advantages for Shah as well as economic (he demurred
                                slightly). Noted that during my Washington consultations number of
                                officials had pointed out there benefit to U.S. as well as Iran in
                                relaxed Iran-U.S.S.R. relationship. Shah said he knew this but some
                                “junior officers” have been “critical.” I took occasion to point out
                                that number Iranians misquote Americans to Shah feeling they can
                                improve their own standing with him by relaying sensational reports.
                                Shah said he fully cognizant of this racket.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>$200,000,000 Military Build-up. Shah expressed deep gratitude for
                                close U.S.-Iranian military cooperation. He felt, however, that
                                there had been serious U.S.G. misunderstanding of his true needs and
                                this has resulted in glaring weaknesses in his security
                                establishment. He stressed throughout conversation his need for
                                anti-aircraft capability and naval units in Persian Gulf. He did not
                                mention aircraft (General Khatemi has made clear to US that he wants
                                hold to <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> cooperation).</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Less Favorable Treatment. Shah complained we had supplied military
                                equipment more generously to number countries, including <pb n="191"
                                    xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>many who have been less staunch
                                friend of U.S. than Iran. Again he recalled his support for U.S.
                                policy in Viet Nam. Shah also said Turks being more favorably
                                treated, e.g. $160,000,000 this year in <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                    >MAP</gloss> grant aid, twelve destroyers (to Iran's none), etc.
                                Indicating his figures exaggerated, I pointed out U.S.G. still has
                                sizeable $45,000,000 grant component in Iran program and Turkey does
                                not have $500,000,000 annual oil income. Shah agreed, saying he glad
                                Iran has increasing capability to purchase its military
                                requirements. Problem is U.S.G. unwillingness to supply even when he
                                is willing to pay.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Military vs Economic. I pointed out to Shah that from purely
                                selfish standpoint U.S.G. is doing itself disservice. U.S. could use
                                $200,000,000 foreign exchange in view our increasing gold outflow.
                                Fact is our Washington colleagues put Iran's interest above our own.
                                They sincerely believe Iran should limit Iran's military
                                expenditures in favor economic development. Shah said no one excels
                                him in desire for Iran's economic development, paid for with Iranian
                                funds. This launched him on description of progress to date.
                                Including success of his dramatic reform program which, he said, has
                                taken wind out of sails of Communists as well as opposition elements
                                inside Iran.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Revised Program. Referring to our 1962 and 1964 agreements Shah
                                said even at time of signature Iranians had indicated their fears
                                that envisaged program would be inadequate. In fact, in letter
                                approving agreements they had noted that situation could change and
                                modifications required. Stressing need for both countries adhere to
                                agreements, I acknowledged that nothing in life is immutable. If
                                threat has altered and if weaknesses have developed in program, they
                                could be talked out and appropriate revisions made. What was hard to
                                explain was sudden unilateral Iranian action.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Anti-aircraft Plight. Shah said he had several times sought to
                                make clear to US his deep concern re anti-aircraft defense. He had
                                highest regard for U.S. military but even they can make mistakes. In
                                Viet Nam only eight percent American aircraft being shot down by
                                missiles; 92 percent by ground-fire. This has precipitated total
                                revision US military thinking re anti-aircraft defense.

                                determined to obtain that type vessel. He feels his need is as valid

                                consider threat less formidable than does he. Re Iraq, Shah said
                                just last week four Iraqi tanks crossed Iranian border and captured
                                small Iranian mule train falsely suspected <pb n="192"

                                other Gulf principalities. Syria has openly advocated Arab move on
                                Khuzistan. Iraq has same objectives, even though only Qassim stated

                            <item>British Withdrawal. Shah predicted by 1968 British will have
                                withdrawn from Aden and by 1970 probably from Gulf principalities. I
                                called his attention to fact that Iran Del at <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> had joined wolf-pack in voting resolution against
                                British in Aden. Shah said Iran had no alternative but to vote
                                against colonialism. Meanwhile, since British influence one way or
                                other will be withdrawn, Iran remains single constructive free world
                                power capable of protecting commerce and peace in Gulf area from

                                able obtain substantial equipment from U.S. and U.K. in contrast to
                                his own less successful efforts, Shah said he welcomes military
                                strengthening of Saudis. Asked whether Saudis might play role in
                                security of Gulf principalities (as for example by federation), Shah
                                said he saw no objection, provided such consolidation was definitely
                                non-Nasserist. Shah added Iran has no territorial aims on Gulf's
                                southern shore (he did not even mention Bahrain).</item>

                                statement re Khuzistan, it merely convinces Arabs this is an issue
                                re which to make more noise. Shah professed to agree.</item>

                            <item>Shah in President's Shoes. In trying explain U.S. problems, I
                                asked Shah to put himself in President's shoes. I expressed opinion
                                that Presidents are products of their times. Eisenhower was chosen
                                over very able Stevenson because Americans at that point wanted
                                complacency and approved Eisenhower's father image. Kennedy captured
                                American imagination with theme that he wanted get U.S. on move
                                again. World liked Kennedy because of his quivers and arrows foreign
                                policy. (I noted in passing that Shah's complaints re U.S.
                                intervention via Amini stemmed from days when under Kennedy
                                leadership US was trying play more active role in world affairs. In
                                any case, Amini was Shah's choice not that of U.S. Shah said Amini
                                had been intriguing for job since his days as Ambassador in
                                Washington.) I said U.S. people have become increasingly
                                disillusioned. After two world wars and $110 billion in foreign aid,
                                all to preserve freedom abroad, there is epidemic anti-Americanism
                                in numerous foreign countries. We know it only represents minority
                                who loudmouthed and who by melodramatics capture press headlines.
                                Pity is that some leaders cater to such demagoguery. Americans too
                                are human beings. They resent failure of other people appreciate
                                their endeavors. They doubly resent indignities such as having their
                                SecState spat <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0221"/>upon. They
                                want their President take hard look at foreign relations. This is
                                what President Johnson is doing. Where there is aggression as in
                                Viet Nam, President takes vigorous action and U.S. people
                                overwhelmingly support such policies. But fact that they have to do
                                this thankless job (240 lives lost last week alone) virtually alone
                                causes them to pause. Shah recalled his own support in world
                                capitals for US policy in Viet Nam and expressed apparently sincere
                                view that American boys are “fighting gallantly” in Viet Nam.</item>

                                It is my understanding President himself is personally checking all
                                foreign aid commitments. Shah said he understands this natural
                                American attitude. He felt problem with foreign aid was “way it was
                                handled“, e.g., too many strings, etc. I said reason Congress
                                injected one proviso after another was increasing public concern at
                                lack of foreign appreciation.</item>

                            <item>Second Tranche Paper-work. During conversation Shah spoke with
                                utmost seriousness re delay in completing second tranche paper-work,
                                which was to have been finished when <persName corresp="#p_SMM1"
                                    >Samii</persName> was in Washington two and half months ago.
                                What worries him most, Shah said, is that if Washington can delay
                                paper-work in this way, same “uncertainty” can apply to Iran's
                                supply of military equipment. I reiterated that until now there been
                                no interruption in supplies as scheduled. Shah again referred to
                                    <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> experience. He realized we
                                would say Iran is different but even if there is “only one chance in
                                million” that Iran would find itself in same plight if Pan-Arab
                                dispute arose, he could not take that chance. He said some of his
                                military are now in Europe checking on anti-aircraft and naval
                                equipment. He sincerely hoped early answer would be received from
                                Washington re second tranche since he would “hate to move” in
                                direction which would neither be in U.S. or Iran's interest. He
                                reiterated his desire to work in close harmony with us and to “buy
                                American.”</item>

                            <item>Soviet Aim; Rupture U.S.-Iran Military Cooperation. I called
                                Shah's attention to current output of Communist-bloc anti-Iranian
                                clandestine broadcasting stations. Major attack is on U.S.-Iran
                                military cooperation. Noting that he has chosen to go along with
                                first stage of classic Communist strategy, i.e., alliance of
                                Communists with national aspirations, obviously Soviets now
                                concentrating on second stage, i.e., disrupting Iran's ties with
                                West. I sincerely hoped Shah would block this Soviet move. Shah said
                                it is U.S. which by second tranche delay is aiding Soviet objective.
                                I closed conversation by quoting Arab proverb “You can't clap with
                                one hand” and expressed hope nothing would intervene to disrupt
                                basic friendship which exists between our two countries including
                                our military cooperation. Shah cordially agreed.</item>

                        another country. Accordingly, I would appreciate your personal intervention
                        with White House to break loose long-delayed paper-work re second tranche of
                        our military program with Iran. It should be with interest rate of four
                        percent. If this unsalable please get it out whatever the rate but hopefully
                        less than five percent.</p>

                        of all subjects of mutual interest. Shah and I are getting along fine. But
                        in his present blue mood, Shah needs evidence that Washington still loves
                        him. Therefore, please do your best to assure that in foreseeable future
                        some high ranking U.S.G. official drops in at Tehran to hold Shah's hand.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> suggested you yourself during

                    <p>I cannot stress too strongly that our relations with Iran are at cross-roads.
                        Shah wants to go on same course with U.S. I am sure this is in our country's
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>If feasible, show this message to President. Despite poison of Gudarzian
                        fiasco, Shah trusts President, recalling his visit here in 1962. Shah asks
                        little. Can't we keep this country in free world camp?</p>

                            is not one-shot undertaking. Shah's personality undergoes steady
                            metamorphosis. To understand current developments, such as authorization
                            to borrow up to $200,000,000 for military purposes it is therefore
                            necessary to fathom present state of Shah's mind.</item>

                            as in 1941–45, nor vacillating youth of late forties. Mosadeq era
                            effected major conversion. While for decade leaning heavily on Uncle
                            Sam's shoulders, Shah has increasingly become self-sufficient authority.
                            Iran has been making remarkable strides. Shah believes it is because he
                            knows better than anyone else how to handle his people. Former

                                    play-boy. Virtually every waking moment is invested in progress
                                    and security his country. This is dulling and can tend to foster
                                    sense of infallibility. Shah should have more diversions.</item>

                                <item>Pretensions. Convinced that he has mastered job of pulling his
                                    listless and backward people forward, Shah knows that he is more
                                    firmly in saddle in Iran than ever before. This is fact which we
                                    must also recognize. It is not surprising that Shah feels his
                                    talents can have wider usefulness. Hence recent moves to build
                                    up his image in Afro-Asian world. At this point, however, his
                                    political ambitions in area do not include territorial
                                    aggrandizement, even Bahrain. On the whole his ambitions are
                                    constructive and responsible.</item>

                                    (As <persName>George Allen</persName> observes this is precise
                                    goal of U.S.G. policy since Azerbaijan days.) Soaring oil income
                                    makes independent policy possible economically. Politically, he
                                    is having inner tension between his basic beliefs which coincide
                                    with those of West and expediency of enhancing his image in
                                    unprincipled Afro-Asian political milieu. Shah cherishes his
                                    ties with U.S., but Viet-nam and Pakistan have shaken him badly.
                                    In Viet-nam, Diem was murdered and despite American military
                                    power, Shah fears end result may be negotiated settlement which
                                    in Iran's case could mean loss of wealthy Khuzistan. For Shah
                                    lesson of Pakistan is that Iran must have reasonably adequate
                                    military resources in event military supplies are shut off
                                    during regional conflict. Beyond these selfish considerations,
                                    Shah sincerely believes it is in US, as well as Iran's interest,
                                    that Iran itself be able cope with regional threats. Hence, his
                                    desire to have adequate military capability.</item>

                                <item>Surprise tactic. Over years Shah has learned that hesitation
                                    permits intrusion of opposing forces. When Soviets proposed
                                    non-aggression pact in 1959, delay in following it up permitted
                                    Western Ambassadors to block agreement. <gloss

                            because of recent successes. He tells me his White Revolution has “taken
                            wind out of sails” of Communist and National Front movements. Steel mill
                            transaction, like eating of forbidden fruit, has given populace big
                            lift. Yet Shah knows he is treading on dangerous territory. He,
                            therefore, engages in rationalization and self-justification. <list>

                        <item>Shah feels misunderstood. Not all of Shah's complaints are due to
                            self-rationalization. He is basically on our side. He is affording U.S.
                            facilities of tremendous strategic importance. He has spoken up for us
                            on Viet-nam when others have spit on us. He is piloting his country on
                            an economic take-off. His efforts in this connection are gaining wider
                            support and participation from skilled Western-trained civil servants.
                            Shah's security problems cannot be dismissed lightly. Soviet-backed
                            neighbors are receiving some military equipment superior in quality and
                            quantity. Despite all that we have done in past, Shah feels U.S. today
                            does not appreciate him nor understand his needs.</item>

                        <item>$200,000,000 Motivation. Shah is military expert. There is little
                            doubt his present military posture is weak in air defense. While we may
                            not agree, he understandably believes that Kharg Island and virtual
                            forest of off-shore oil installations in Persian Gulf require security
                            protection, including destroyers. In Shah's view, other countries in
                            this area, whether US allies like Turkey or Soviet-supported outfits
                            like Egypt, Iraq and Afghanistan, have equipment better both in quantity
                            and quality, notably <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s and MIGs. A
                            pilot himself, he is envious of Mach 2.3 MIG speeds. Since he now has
                            financial resources of his own, Shah is determined to maintain parity,
                            hopefully via supplies from his closest friends, the Americans; but if

                            times that while he was in Moscow Soviets offered him MIGs. As Shah sees
                            it, greatest need is in anti-aircraft and naval equipment. (We have
                            impression that General Khatemi, who is realist as well as admirer of US
                            Air Force equipment, has toned Shah down for moment re more highly

                            dictate Shah's policies, including details his military establishment.
                            Our agreement of 1962 was intended to do that. It lasted only until
                            1964, when revision was unavoidable. But even 1964 agreement was signed
                            under Iranian protest. We hoped our grant aid “sweetener” would retain
                            our dominance. It has not. He has told me he would hate to change
                            American pattern in which his military establishment is molded but
                            unless U.S. recognizes his security requirements he has no choice. Thus
                            his move to obtain $200,000,000 additional authorization from Majlis is
                            not ploy to obtain favor from U.S. (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1"

                            other fields as well. It is much better in our view to hold Shah to aims
                            of those agreements by recognizing that modifications are possible. This

                            considerable leverage in his military planning. It will also permit us
                            to use solid citizens like General Khatemi to curb some of Shah's
                            extreme desires (Khatemi has told us of his annoyance that other supreme
                            commanders and sycophants fail to air with Shah Iran's limitations such
                            as trained manpower). Incidentally, it may be that some diversification
                            in sources of Shah's military procurement would be of value to U.S. by
                            removing onus that U.S. is Shah's exclusive support in vital military
                            field. In any case, by maintaining dialogue with Shah re things military

                            extent. To influence his behavior re this and other issues we need
                            maintain friendly dialogue which has characterized our relations over

                            its own feet. USAID economic assistance is being terminated. Our
                            technical assistance program is being phased out. Our military aid
                            program is also tapering off. In recommending that we unfreeze second

                            conviction is that this will help insure that after take-off Iran will

                        your personal interest. So this is an inexpensive way of showing you haven't

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> briefly reviewed the
                        memorandum, explaining that the recent agreement with the Soviet Union for
                        the construction of a steel mill is another manifestation of the Shah's
                        desire for a more independent posture. He explained that an increasing ruble
                        balance over the years would bring closer economic ties between Iran and the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked if we are prepared to sell the ships and planes requested
                        by the Shah. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> replied
                        that the question of ships is out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2"
                            >Komer</persName> suggested that we sell planes to the Shah and let the
                        British sell them ships.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman pointed out that the Shah is concerned over our reliability as a
                        supplier of spare parts for military equipment in light of our recent stand
                        in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said that the Bureau of
                        Near East Asia supports the Country Team's recommendation that future
                        progress reports be submitted on an Ad Hoc basis. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> expressed concern over the
                        complacency of recent reports and apparent concentration on short term
                        factors. He suggested that the Group keep a close watch on Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Group agreed with the Chairman's recommendation that the Ambassador
                        report quarterly by letter on the situation rather than through an <gloss

                                    belief that joint military program envisaged was inadequate,
                                    particularly since circumstances might change. Furthermore, Iran
                                    as independent country had reserved right to alter program if it
                                    determined it to be necessary for national self-defense.</item>

                                    is increasingly riveted on Persian Gulf because of: (1) almost
                                    inevitable British withdrawal; (2) Syrian and Iraqi agitation re
                                    Khuzistan; (3) development of Kharg Island which makes Iranian
                                    crude oil exports almost totally vulnerable to one surprise
                                    attack; (4) King Faisal's increased interest in cooperating with
                                    Iran, but until both have military establishment of reasonable
                                    respectability such cooperation is ephemeral; and (5) Iran's
                                    obvious destiny along with Saudis, as heirs to British, to
                                    protest security and tranquillity of Gulf not only from
                                    predatory regional threateners but in interest of whole free

                                <item>Unfavorable Comparisons. As far as Iran's defense is
                                    concerned, Shah believes that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                        >USG</gloss> has “built two-thirds of dam” and should
                                    complete it if Iran's defensive role is to be useful. Shah again
                                    noted Saudis, who have much less need than Iran, are being
                                    allowed to purchase $400,000,000 or more from Western sources,
                                    including three battalions of Hawk missiles. He wondered why we
                                    continue to “beef up” Turkey in much more favorable way than
                                    Iran, e.g. nine destroyers, submarines, etc. (I noted: his
                                    impression of U.S. <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program
                                    in Turkey is exaggerated, Turkey has always had much larger
                                    military establishment, Turkey has no $500,000,000 annual oil
                                    income, and in U.S. public opinion Turkey still ranks high for
                                    its effective role with U.S. in Korean War.) Shah went on to
                                    point out Soviet-supplied neighbors, notably Iraq, continue to

                                <item>U.S. Ally. Making clear his continued dedication to U.S.-Iran
                                    alliance, Shah once again said if Soviets cross frontier it
                                    would be world <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>war and
                                    Iran would count on U.S. support. He believed however that
                                    Soviets at least for present have peaceful intentions. If
                                    regional hostilities were to develop, Shah added, he doubted, as
                                    he had observed to NYTimes man Brady, that Iran could “count on”
                                    active U.S. military help. Conclusion, therefore, was clear:
                                    Iran itself must be in position to cope with such
                                    trouble.</item>

                                <item>Anti-aircraft Defense. Shah said he anxious to have U.S.
                                    military expert survey Iran's air defense needs, so as to
                                    determine where various items such as Hawks and early warning
                                    equipment can most efficiently be installed to give Iran best
                                    protection. He said he is considering British bloodhounds but
                                    seemed interested when I suggested his greatest threat is from
                                    low-level attack which is better countered by Hawks.</item>
                                <label>B.</label>
                                <item>Aircraft. Shah said there is no question Iran will need higher
                                    performance aircraft than F–5. Question is which one. He
                                    disclosed he is giving serious consideration to Mirage, which he
                                    considers equal to MIG–21. There is also possibility of F–4C but
                                    price is probably $2,500,000 or $3,000,000 which is almost twice
                                    as much as Mirage. TFX would be best plane but Iran cannot
                                    afford aircraft which costs $5,000,000 or more per copy. Shah
                                    said his first choice F5X if and when it ever goes into
                                    production. As Shah sees picture, two squadrons of one of these
                                    higher performance aircraft should replace the eighth and ninth
                                    F–5 squadrons which according 1964 agreement Iran would purchase
                                    from U.S. Meanwhile, Shah feels that for efficiency purposes
                                    size of present F–5 squadrons should be increased from 13 to 16
                                    planes each. He said Iran is prepared to purchase 21 F–5's
                                    necessary to enlarge seven <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>

                                <item>Naval Vessels. Shah said present key question is whether in
                                    expanding his naval security capability in Gulf he should get
                                    three small vessels (presumably recommended by British to
                                    General Toufanian) or one modern destroyer which Chief of
                                    Italian Navy recommended (at cost of $40,000,000). Noting
                                    problems of manning ships when present Iranian Navy already
                                    understaffed, I told Shah he wise in taking careful look before

                                <item>Tanks. Shah said his M–47 tanks will eventually be phased out
                                    and he remains interested in possibility of Sheridans as their
                                    replacement.</item>

                        <item>U.S. Attitude. After appropriate remarks concerning longstanding
                            friendly US-Iran relationship in military field, I told Shah his
                            explanation of situation would be helpful in Washington. It no secret
                            that recent $200,000,000 authorization had caught his U.S. friends by
                            surprise. It not our intention to back-seat drive, but we did have close
                            relationship translated into mutual commitments in 1964 agreement
                            designed to provide <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>Iran with
                            biggest bang per buck. He must realize questions would inevitably arise
                            in Washington, notably on Capitol Hill, as to need for USMAP grant
                            component in that program if program ignored by Iran. I acknowledged it
                            is difficult to argue that 1964 circumstances immutable, but at same
                            time we would need valid explanations such as he had just given in order
                            persuade Congress to continue providing necessary funds. It was good
                            particularly to hear, I said, that he continues to respect 1964
                            agreement, even though he considers modifications necessary.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>U.S. Pattern. Shah said it obvious Iran has every interest in
                            continuing to obtain military equipment from U.S. To change pattern of
                            supply would only compound Iran's military problems. He therefore
                            sincerely hoped that U.S.G. would consider his revised needs promptly
                            and let him know at an early date prices, financing terms and
                            availability. He emphasized that while decisions must be made in near
                            future, point is that in most cases it would be two or three years
                            before equipment would actually be delivered.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Economic Frame-work. While appreciating Shah's eagerness to make
                            decisions, I noted that important element in our 1964 agreement was
                            fitting Iranian military program into Iran's economic capability. Shah
                            reiterated his usual points that economic development is useless if it
                            is not secure and that Iran's income is continually rising (again he
                            mentioned $2,000,000,000 target by 1970). Moreover, his Chief Financial
                            Advisor, Central Bank Governor <persName>Mehdi Samii</persName>, had
                            noted that recent parliamentary authorization for $200,000,000 in fact
                            made it possible for Iran to contract for more than that amount of
                            military equipment if necessary. Shah again noted that 1964 program
                            would cost $280,000,000 or $80,000,000 more than anticipated (including
                            addition of 60 to 90 day supply of ammo. Ninety day supply is necessary,
                            Shah said, because in any case it requires three months to transport
                            materiel from U.S. and off-loading of explosives is impossible in heat
                            of Persian Gulf summers.) Shah said his economists had recently produced
                            economic data which made clear Iran's capability for proposed military
                            purchases but he did not seem clear whether this was last annual review
                            or something subsequent. In any case, Shah said he realized U.S.G.'s
                            interest in economic aspects of his military program and he would assure
                            that appropriate consultations would take place.</item>

                        specifically re anti-aircraft equipment, high performance aircraft, and
                        naval vessels. Re anti-aircraft equipment, we can gain time and keep Shah
                        content by favorable response to request for experts' survey which he has
                        now thrice made (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 850<note n="2"

                            xml:id="pg_206" facs="0234"/>Shah would similarly appreciate some expert

                        item will be aircraft. For year now, Shah has been eager because of long
                        lead-time to make decisions with respect to post F–5 period. Obviously
                        French salesmen have gotten to him glamorizing the Mirage and such
                        representations by French and others will undoubtedly whet his appetite
                        further. One way of forestalling precipitate action in this field would be
                        to provide info re prospects of an F5X. If Shah felt there were hope of his
                        buying F5X, we would not need to worry about Mirages, Lightnings or even
                        MIGs.</p>

                    <p>When <persName>Averell Harriman</persName> met with the Shah in Tehran on
                        January 3, 1966, he conveyed President Johnson's greetings and warm
                        appreciation for his support on Vietnam. The Shah said that he had made his
                        position clear on trips to various world capitals, i.e., that stopping
                        aggression in Vietnam, as elsewhere, was a matter of vital principle.
                        Emphasizing the need to recognize world opinion, however, he also stated
                        that he unqualifiedly supported the President's initiative in the bombing
                        pause. He pointed out that resuming the bombing too early would lend
                        credence to Soviet propaganda claiming the U.S. peace moves were a “facade”
                        before further escalation. (Text of telegram 954 from Tehran, January 4;

                    <p>The arms inventory of the Arabs continues to increase in quantity and
                        quality, but reportedly for use against Israel. The Arab's capacity to
                        absorb sophisticated equipment is limited, however. Such equipment could be
                        employed on a selective basis against Iran, e.g., Iraqi fighter aircraft,
                        Iraqi and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> bombers, and <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> naval craft. Its use en toto against Iran
                        is unlikely in the next five years in view of inter-Arab rifts, Arab fears
                        of an Israeli preemptive attack, and of current Arab commitments in Yemen
                        and against the Kurds. Neither the Iraqi ground forces nor the estimated
                        projected improvement of the Iraq Air Force pose a very formidable threat to
                        Iran. The source of Iran's wealth and subsequent ability to develop itself
                        has been and is likely to remain its oil-rich southwest. Iran has recently
                        realized that its concentration at Abadan and the supplying oil fields must
                        be spread out, and it has taken steps to accomplish this dispersion.
                        Additionally, it is developing other capital investments—and potential
                        targets—throughout Iran. Although this dispersion will make each target
                        relatively less important if it is destroyed, concurrently they will become
                        more difficult to defend and will require ever-increasing amounts of
                        defensive equipment—which the Iranians do not have the trained personnel to
                        operate. The Iranian AC and W System currently faces north. Regardless of
                        how tight the Iranian defense system may become, however, some aggressive
                        segment of an attacking force is more than likely going to reach its
                        objective.</p>

                    <p>The urbanization likely to follow the increase in capital development will
                        bring with it the problems already evident in other areas of the
                        world—problems of housing, jobs, and food shortages which provocateurs will
                        attempt to use to their advantage. The mullahs used these problems in June
                        1963 to instigate the urban riots which were strongly repressed by military
                        forces and which can and probably will be repressed <pb n="208"

                        traditional landlord-peasant relationship and the tribal nomadism have been
                        broken, in part, by the land-reform program. This program will continue, but
                        it will be phased so as to disrupt as little as possible. Social reforms
                        will likewise be continued, but at a pace which will not alienate the
                        conservatives. The Medical Corps and the Literacy Corps will receive more
                        emphasis to implement these reforms.</p>
                    <p>A more literate public will expect a larger share of the economic and social
                        benefits from Iran's oil wealth. This is reported to be true in Khuzistan,
                        the source of the oil, not only of the sizable Arab population there but of
                        the other inhabitants as well; some tribes claim that the oil fields were
                        taken from them. The exact number of Arabs in the population of the province
                        is not known, although reports indicate that at least 100,000 Arabs live in
                        the sugar cane area north of Abadan and another 100,000 live in the date
                        groves to the south. The latest census of Iran (1956) counted about
                        2,000,000 people in the entire province. An estimate of the number of
                        Arab-speaking people in the province is about 500,000, half of Iran's
                        Arabs.</p>
                    <p>In line with the historic aversion of the Persians to the “late-coming”
                        Arabs, the Government of Iran until recently had not given much thought to
                        the far-off Khuzistanis, especially the Arabs. Currently, however, it has
                        indicated the district's importance and the potential for subversion of its
                        Arab population. It has increased the amount of government funds spent there
                        and has instituted some repressive measures against the Arabs. Although
                        reports indicate that the Arabs have become less apathetic than heretofore,
                        continued interest in the area by Tehran should preclude the start of the
                        type of terrorism that changed British policy in Palestine and Cyprus and is
                        working against <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence in Aden.</p>
                    <p>Possibly a greater danger to the government's operation of the oil fields
                        will occur if the labor unions which are planned there get out of hand. The
                        government is attempting to permit the laborers to “let off steam” by
                        establishing several tightly controlled unions. These unions might merge and
                        subversive elements could inflame attitudes as they did recently in Bahrein.
                        The government appears to have recognized this potential problem. Whether it
                        is willing to mend its autocratic and bureaucratic ways and satisfy the
                        aspirations of the laborers and the other Khuzistanis, including the Arabs,
                        however, is open to question.</p>

                            of keeping Iranian military procurement at a level consistent with
                            legitimate military requirements against the spectrum of threats to
                            Iran, while minimizing the impact of military procurement on Iranian
                            economic development, has been emphasized in the terms of reference and
                            is further reflected in the U.S. Government-approved background data

                        purchase $200 million of military equipment. It is our view that this action
                        by Iran is <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>contrary to the spirit
                        of the 1962 and 1964 agreements. We believe such a purchase will have an

                                would be better off to shift its expenditures to capital investment
                                and social progress.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Shah of Iran has become increasingly concerned over what he views as a
                        mounting Arab threat to Iran's security. We have accordingly <pb n="212"
                            xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"/>agreed, after several months of discussion,
                        to conduct a survey of Iranian military requirements against the non-Soviet
                        threat. The Survey Team will arrive in Iran on 16 February.</p>
                    <p>The Survey Team's Terms of Reference direct that all recommendations be in
                        full consonance with the U.S. objective of maintaining our position as
                        primary arms supplier to Iran, while limiting equipment purchases to
                        legitimate requirements and minimizing the impact on Iran's economic and
                        social development. The Team does require, however, supplemental guidance as
                        to specific items of U.S. equipment it can consider in formulating a
                        response to Iran.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">II. Discussion:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As you will recall, the 1964 U.S.-Iranian Memorandum of Understanding called
                        for Iran to purchase two squadrons of F–5 interceptors during the late 1960s
                        to supplement the seven squadrons provided by <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> grant aid. Soon after the agreement was signed, the Shah
                        informed us that the introduction of Soviet-built MIG–21 aircraft into
                        neighboring Arab countries, particularly Iraq, made it “imperative” for him
                        to buy a higher performance aircraft than the F–5. In this context he has
                        mentioned an improved F–5, the F–4 or the F–111 as possible substitutes.</p>
                    <p>In a study of Iran's air defense requirements prepared for <gloss
                            target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> last fall, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        indicated their belief that Iran had a genuine need for a higher performance
                        aircraft than the F–5 and recommended that the U.S. sell the Iranians two
                        squadrons (UE–13) of F–4s in the 1967–1973 time frame.</p>
                    <p>Another of the Shah's felt needs is an anti-aircraft system to defend key air
                        bases and oil installations in western and southwestern Iran. The Shah
                        deferred his decision on choice of weapons pending a U.S. decision on what
                        we intended to procure for U.S. forces. When informed in December that the
                        U.S. had chosen the gun (Vulcan)/Chaparral mix, the Shah expressed interest
                        in procuring the system, providing that price and availability were
                        reasonable. Although I understand U.S. requirements are expected to saturate
                        Vulcan and Chaparral production capacity until <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 70, it might become politically desirable to be prepared to
                        offer Iran one or two battalions from current production before U.S.
                        requirements for 22 battalions are fully satisfied in 1970.</p>
                    <p>The Shah also wants a tank to replace the M–47s now in inventory, and
                        expressed keen interest in the Sheridan during last year's Annual Review of
                        the 1964 agreement. Army production of the Sheridan is scheduled to peak at
                        50 a month in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 and a phased delivery to
                        Iran, beginning in the last half of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 68,
                        could be worked into the Army's production schedule.</p>
                    <p>In the naval area, the Shah believes he needs destroyer types to meet the
                        threat to his oil installations in the Persian Gulf area, and an Iranian <pb
                            n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0241"/>purchase team recently visited
                        Western Europe to secure price and availability data on various equipment
                        items, including new-construction destroyers.</p>
                    <p>In general we believe the Shah exaggerates the non-Soviet threat to Iran, and
                        would like to discourage his purchase of highly sophisticated weaponry. We
                        concede that Iranian air defenses in the southwest could be strengthened and
                        a follow-on tank deserves consideration, but we regard the Persian Gulf
                        naval threat as minimal. On the other hand, the Shah has purchasing power
                        and a determination to modernize his forces, so our continued political
                        relations depend on a moderately forthcoming response.</p>

                    <p>Your letter of February 4, about obtaining more information on rightist or
                        opposition groups has given us a great deal of trouble.<note n="2"

                                >Bracken</persName> had written <persName>Herz</persName>, saying
                            that <gloss target="#t_INRRNA1">INR/RNA</gloss> and GTI were both
                            concerned with the need to obtain more information about the nature and
                            scope of the activities of rightist and conservative opposition groups,
                            including religious groups, in Iran, and their interaction (if any) with
                            each other. This concern had been highlighted by the recent arrests of
                            55 opponents of the regime. (Ibid.)</note> Frankly, the difficulty is
                        that these opposition groups are essentially clandestine, and the national
                        police are hunting for the very kind of information that you are asking us
                        to procure. I know Alan is working on this too, but the Counselor for
                        Political Affairs really has to be very careful not to promise you too
                        much.</p>
                    <p>On the positive side, we do try to keep contacts with various exponents of
                        the religious milieu, but I must confess that in respect to the kind of
                        information that the Department is seeking these contacts are not too

                        really answer the question that you have raised.</p>
                    <p>You are of course quite right that we learn of the existence of small
                        obscurantist rightist cells or groups only when they find themselves in an
                        “acting” posture, but in this respect it is very difficult for us to be
                        better <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0243"/>informed than <gloss

                        equally unaware by the <persName corresp="#p_MHA1">Mansur</persName>
                        assassination, a fact that still rankles with the Shah and has caused him to
                        ride the internal security people rather hard of late.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty of getting really deeply into the rather amorphous clerical
                        opposition stems in part from the fact that a Christian foreigner really has
                        little chance of taking its pulse by meeting just a few mullahs and
                        ayatollahs. Also, since <persName corresp="#p_KAR1">Khomeini</persName> was
                        banished in the aftermath of the status bill furor, clerical oppositionists
                        are even less pro-American than before. Direct approaches are sometimes
                        rebuffed and the most glaring case of such a counter-productive effort was
                        provided last year by <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> Clevenger
                        when he tried to sound out <persName>Ayatollah</persName> Qomi in Meshed.
                        Not only did Qomi rebuff him but the rather innocuous conversation seems to
                        have been tape-recorded by <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>. All in
                        all, we will try to do better in the future, but we really cannot be too
                        sure.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, when the question of the religious opposition was raised at the
                        Consular Conference here last week, I felt that the responses that we got
                        from our consuls were equaled in their inconclusiveness only by the
                        responses to our questions about the Development Corps and the Bakhshdar
                        program. We may be groping in the dark, but I promise you that we will
                        continue to grope and “try harder” to grope a little more effectively in the
                        future.</p>

                        been sharpened and fact that he is making them public shows extent to which

                            <p>Pressure on West. It is clear that there is now concerted campaign to
                                increase oil offtake and obtain wanted military equipment from West,
                                coupled with threat to reorient trade patterns if traditional
                                orientation does not yield desired results. That this is campaign is
                                apparent from number of conversations Shah has had with American
                                visitors recently, and from candid comment we received from one of
                                his subordinates who cited recent reports of U.S. aid to <gloss
                                    target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Turkey to conclude that
                                “apparently the only way to get one's way with the Americans is to
                                be difficult.”</p>

                        <item>Pride of Accomplishment. Shah pointed to ten percent growth in Iranian
                            year now drawing to close, stable prices, and two and one half percent
                            population growth, contrasting this with lack of progress in neighboring
                            countries. He sees Iran booming, investments picking up, reform program
                            paying off, prices stable, labor satisfied, farmers working harder. All
                            this ascribed to “the inborn Iranian genius” (for which one may read the
                            genius of <persName corresp="#p_PMR1">Mohammed Reza Shah

                            orders”) and in recent conversations, Shah has lashed out against
                            foreign and domestic critics and pessimists who have been proved wrong
                            by events. Privately, he has zeroed in on “Harvard economists” (to which
                            one may safely add Iranian economists trained in U.S. who are skeptical
                            about growing Iranian commitments) and served blunt notice that
                            determination of what is best for Iran will henceforth be made by
                            Iranians alone.</item>

                            will defense measures be slighted. Shah spoke pointedly of national duty
                            to defend Khuzistan and south Iran “Even if there were no single oil
                            well and no commercial ship passed through (Persian Gulf)” and referred
                            to “various affronts to Iran's position, status, dignity and interests”
                            in Gulf area.</item>

                            last fall's crisis still deeply troubles him was given when Shah said:
                            “There have been developments in world recently which have been an
                            exemplary lesson to U.S., that Iran cannot surrender its destiny to
                            whims of foreigners even if they are very close friends…We cannot
                            subject our destiny entirely to decisions of others who can one day help
                            us and another day not help us. This is not only from national point of
                            view. Internationally also it is not dependable.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: We interpret latter point as argument that
                        Iran is really acting in interest of its allies and of world peace by
                        becoming less dependent on West for its defense. He has often pointed out
                        that if U.S. were required to intervene militarily to protect Iran, conflict
                        would be wider and potentialities greater for Communists to create Vietnam
                        type of situation. At same time Shah gave assurance that “Iran still retains
                        the same importance in regard to preservation of regional security which
                        could be interpreted as guarded reaffirmation of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>While speech contains nothing new, tone is getting shriller and sense of
                        self-satisfaction and grievance somewhat stronger. It is apparent that
                        recent resumption of U.S. aid to Nasser despite his postponement of
                        withdrawal from Yemen, and reports of additional U.S. military assistance to
                        Greece and Turkey pursuant to <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1"
                            >McNaughton</persName>'s visit to those two countries (and not to Iran)
                        have added to feeling of Shah and his ranking subordinates that Iran is once
                        more being taken for granted by West, that “papa knows best” attitude of
                        Americans toward Iran's military requirements is an affront to national
                        dignity, that Iran has the means to purchase what it needs for its defense,
                        that present U.S. balance of payments policies threaten Iran's remarkable
                        economic progress, and that best way to deal with Uncle Sam is to make a
                        public scene.</p>
                    <p>As Art Buchwald would phrase it, there has been a “turmoil gap” in Iran
                        recently. The Shah is aware of this, and would like to fill it; but we still
                        believe that despite certain threats, for instance that he would resort to
                        Soviets for arms procurement, there are prudent limits to any
                        “reorientation” which he is not likely to transgress under present
                        circumstances. Point of concern is when and whether Shah and Iran become
                        captive to “reorientation” speech-making.</p>

                        of January 31, 1966 delivered to me by your Ambassador to that country. I
                        gratefully acknowledged it by a letter sent to you through my Ambassador in
                            Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Telegram 967 to Vienna, January
                            30, transmitted a message from the President to the Shah informing him
                            that the U.S. and South Vietnamese Governments were ending the
                            suspension of bombing attacks against North Vietnam. (Ibid., POL 27 VIET

                            Correspondence, Vol. I.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>“Some time before that your esteemed and able envoy, Mr. <persName>Averell
                            Harriman</persName>, whom you had entrusted with the mission to explain
                        the American aims and objectives paid a visit to Tehran and gave me a full
                        account of his mission. We had a long and fruitful exchange of views.”</p>
                    <p>“It would be appropriate to observe, Mr. President, that the evil of
                        aggression which has plunged South Vietnam into the miseries of a ruinous
                        war, may also engulf other areas of the world, if adequate measures are not
                        taken in good time to forestall it. The developing course of events in this
                        region clearly shows that my predictions of these past years have not been
                        far wide of mark. Let me add, Mr. President, that unfortunately disruptive
                        elements in the Middle East, in utter disregard of morality, principle and
                        human life are constantly on the look out to carry out their destructive
                        activities in order to be able to maintain their position which they could
                        not otherwise do so in a healthy and orderly community. We are at present
                        face to face with dangers coming from directions which, though clearly
                        foreseen by me, we could not for reasons I would not elaborate here, take
                        adequate measures to provide against them.”</p>
                    <p>“I need hardly stress, Mr. President, that my cherished aim in this region is
                        the safeguarding of peace and stability—factors so essential to the
                        implementation of our reforms and further enhancing the prosperity of our
                        people. And perhaps, it will be no exaggeration to say that the political
                        and economic stability of Iran, as so far maintained, has proved to be not
                        only to the advantage of our own country but also of great value to the
                        security and continued stability of the whole region.”</p>
                    <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0247"/>
                    <p>“But we can hardly maintain this situation if we fail to provide ourselves
                        with the necessary facilities and requirements. Recently, however,
                        diminishing United States military assistance coupled with the exchange
                        requirements of our growing population are placing unduly heavy burden on
                        our limited foreign exchange resources, further aggravated by the fact that
                        in comparison with other oil-producing countries of the Middle East, our oil
                        production figures bear no relation to the needs of our greater and growing
                        population.”</p>
                    <p>“Faced with this situation and feeling more than ever the grave danger
                        gathering in the direction of our Western and Southern borders, our national
                        interests demand that we lose no time in preparing ourselves to cope with
                        any threat by purchasing our military requirements with our limited foreign
                        exchange at a reasonable price from the United States or look out for other
                        suppliers who are in readiness to offer us better terms and conditions. I
                        earnestly hope that this vital question of our approaches in the United
                        States will receive favourable consideration. I take this opportunity to
                        offer you my heartfelt and sincere wishes for the success and fulfilment of
                        your great task. May God Almighty's blessings be with you in the pursuit of
                        your high ideals and noble work.”</p>

                            stressed hope U.S.G. would be responsive, for Iran has every reason to
                            continue in pattern set by long-standing U.S.-Iran military cooperation.
                            He said urgency problem increasing and there no need delay because of
                            annual economic review in June or July. He gratified by expert military
                            advice which is emerging from General <persName>Peterson</persName>'s
                            military survey mission. He confident findings will support his own
                            conviction that Iran does have justifiable additional military needs
                            because of increasing vulnerability of Iran's vital source of wealth,
                            i.e., Persian Gulf region.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Shah Determined. Shah said he wanted to make clear that his public as
                            well as private statements re Iran's critical needs and his
                            determination to have them supplied elsewhere if West is unresponsive is
                            not bluff, threat or blackmail. He said <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> receiving SU–9 (Fishpot B) aircraft which superior even
                            to MIG–21's of which Egypt already has goodly supply. Nasser also has 12
                            destroyers, 9 submarines and number of deadly <gloss target="#t_Komar1"
                                >KOMAR</gloss> boats, all from Soviets. Iraq recently acquired 20
                            MIG–21's and now Shah hears they acquiring <gloss target="#t_Komar1"
                                >KOMAR</gloss> boats. If latter report true Shah said it clearly
                            accentuates Iranian requirements in Gulf area. Urging reasonable terms
                            from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, Shah said he has heard that
                            price of F4C's is from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000. By contrast, MIG's are
                            available for $600,000. He hopeful US response will be such as to enable
                            him to maintain U.S.-orientation as in past.</item>

                        <item>No Viet-Nam Here. Noting I not aware what President Johnson's response
                            might be, I told Shah he should nevertheless keep in mind US has
                            problems also. We currently carrying thankless burden of stopping
                            aggression in Viet-Nam and American people heavily preoccupied this
                            matter. Congress also leary of U.S.G. military programs following sad
                            experience of Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> conflict. Shah
                            said it is precisely because he does not want Viet-Nam story repeated
                            here that he is pursuing policy of making Iran self-reliant as far as
                            regional security concerned. He noted U.S. in any case not member of
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and its bilateral agreement
                            with Iran is directed exclusively at Communist threat. Shah reiterated
                            complete support for what US doing in Viet-Nam and recounted how he had
                            made this clear to <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> Dep FornMin
                            Kuznetsov during latter's visit here week ago. He reiterated his
                            long-standing view that it is in U.S. interest for Iran be able take
                            care of itself.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Nature of Collaboration. I told Shah I felt U.S. friendship for Iran
                            was well proven. We delighted country is able stand on its own feet, an
                            objective to which we had made substantial contribution. Our cooperative
                            relations in military field were particularly noteworthy. I felt
                            confident that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will continue to do
                            what it can to be helpful but he should not build false expectations. If
                            what we might do was not enough, Iran is, as he has emphasized an
                            “independent” country, and it would have to make its own decisions re
                            wisdom of reorienting its philosophy.</item>

                        <item>Agreed Program. Specifically, I said Washington demonstrated
                            responsiveness in sending <persName>Peterson</persName> mission. While
                            mission's findings still not completed, my impression is that there is
                            growing U.S. awareness of increasing vulnerability of Persian Gulf
                            installations, and this is without regard to who possible aggressor
                            might be. Referring to 1962 and 1964 Memoranda of Understanding, I made
                            clear that whatever emerges from <persName>Peterson</persName> survey
                            would require revision of 1964 memorandum and coordination with annual
                            economic review. I expressed view consideration of revised military
                            program in connection with annual economic review did not necessarily
                            mean delay in efficient and effective defense program in Iran. Shah was
                            a bit taken aback because he apparently hoped to place orders, either
                            with US or elsewhere, in month or two. However, he recognized validity
                            of 1962 and 1964 memoranda and reluctantly agreed to procedure I had
                            outlined.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. Shah was in dark mood, particularly at
                            beginning of audience. Again he recounted list of grievances against us,
                            specifically expressing hope that our defense collaboration would not
                            experience same end reached after several years of discussing what he
                            said President Eisenhower called “damn steel mill.” He stressed time and
                            again Iran's new policy of “independence” and what an obvious success it
                            is with people of Iran. After my rather frank and strong responses, he
                            mellowed a bit. Upon departing, he expressed appreciation and welcomed
                            further such frank exchanges between “two friends.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In speaking as strongly as he did, Shah no doubt was putting on pressure for
                        favorable response from us re things military. Danger is that endeavors of
                        this type can ultimately become national crusade.</p>
                    <p>One of problems here is that few people have courage to speak to Shah except
                        in terms he wants to hear. Thus sitting in his regal isolation he conjures
                        up without restraint various illusions and distortions of reality.
                        Continuing dialogue with US officials is therefore desirable. We continue to
                        hope that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s plans for
                        visit with Shah during <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> trip will
                        materialize.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                    <p>Your letter of February 26th<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d122">Document 122</ref>.</note> shows how clearly you,
                        too, understand the lesson so vividly confirmed in Vietnam—that “a healthy
                        and orderly community” is the best defense against disruptive elements. That
                        is why I am sending my Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to see how
                        we can speed progress in helping the Government of Vietnam bolster this
                        first line of defense.</p>
                    <p>The military campaign there must go on; yet its ultimate purpose is to enable
                        the Vietnamese leaders to press the war against hunger, disease and
                        ignorance. The problem in Vietnam is that both of these campaigns must be
                        waged at the same time, and there are scarcely enough resources—human or
                        otherwise—to go around.</p>
                    <p>This is the tragic backdrop of so many of our hopes for the security and
                        well-being of free men everywhere. I fully understand your own preoccupation
                        with decisions as to what resources you will allocate to preparing your
                        military forces in case they are needed and your determination that those
                        forces be as effective as you can make them. I myself have been deeply
                        impressed since assuming office with the difficulty, even in a country as
                        bountifully endowed as mine, of making constant choices between programs,
                        all of which are worthwhile. I am coming to believe that the essence of
                        great leadership is the ability to pick from an impressive field the few
                        that are truly crucial.</p>
                    <p>Every leader must make those choices for himself, but I am pleased that you
                        have sufficient confidence in us to seek our opinion as to how we can most
                        effectively work together. Happily, the findings of the military survey team
                        which has just completed its work will be available for discussion with you
                        in the course of the annual military-economic review later this spring. I
                        might say that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        has been my mainstay in developing revolutionary analytical tools for
                        weighing cost factors in the tremendously complicated choices I must make. I
                        hope that our joint military-economic talks will give us an opportunity to
                        bring that kind of analysis to bear on your problems in whatever ways may
                        prove helpful.</p>
                    <p>I am reassured by the knowledge that, for many years, our countries have
                        worked together extensively to safeguard peace and stability in the <pb
                            n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>Middle East. Wherever our
                        discussions lead, we can be certain that our mutual respect and common goals
                        will enable us to move ahead in honorable cooperation. I look forward to
                        continued close consultation with you as we do our utmost to solve those
                        problems which touch the heart and marrow of people everywhere—the
                        preservation of national security and the search for the best possible lives
                        for our countrymen.</p>

                        <item>Iran is adopting a more active and independent foreign policy as a
                            result of the Shah's increased confidence in Iran's economic situation,
                            his declining fear of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and his
                            increasing anxiety about Nasser and other Arab nationalists. Iran's new
                            international stance will provide opportunities for the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to expand its presence in the country
                            and will cause difficulties for the US. However, the Shah is well aware
                            that his domestic position and Iran's security depends heavily on US
                            support. Thus he is unlikely to move deliberately to alter the alliance
                            or reduce US activities in Iran. (Paras. 1–10, 13–15)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Domestic considerations are unlikely to alter Iran's foreign policy to
                            any great extent over the next two to three years. The Shah will <pb
                                n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>probably remain firmly in
                            control, though the bulk of the educated middle class probably will
                            remain estranged from the regime. (Paras. 16–19)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Iran's rate of economic growth may be adversely affected by the Shah's
                            ambitious military expansion program. Oil revenues, which are Iran's
                            main source of foreign exchange, are not rising as fast as in the past;
                            the reform program is unlikely to have much effect on the pace of
                            economic development. If, as is likely, the Shah gives priority to his
                            military program, the economic growth rate would probably slow somewhat,
                            accompanied by periods of inflation and recession. (Paras. 21–24)</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>I thank you for your letter of March 16, 1966.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">
                            <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is a source of satisfaction to see that both of us hold identical views on
                        the best defense against disruptive elements—which, to the detriment of our
                        peace and security, are not wanting in this part of the world.</p>
                    <p>This region needs nothing more than peace, tranquillity, and a healthy
                        political climate. A favorable atmosphere must prevail in order to bring
                        lasting and fundamental solution to centuries-old problems. This truth has
                        been well recognized in Iran, as it is reflected in the pattern of our
                        comprehensive economic and social reforms.</p>
                    <p>Back in 1963 it was decided that the great reservoir of talents and energies
                        of young men who had finished their secondary school or university education
                        and become eligible for military service should, instead of serving in
                        barracks, be mobilized and effectively employed for economic and social
                        purposes. These young men, upon completion of the first four months of their
                        military training, and initiation in their respective fields, are organized
                        into various corps such as literacy, health and rural development, and sent
                        to the various parts of the country to serve in distant villages and
                        townships. They carry out their allotted duties with great <pb n="225"
                            xml:id="pg_225" facs="0253"/>devotion and play a constructive role in
                        the improvement of social and economic conditions of the rural areas. They
                        have proved to be a transmission vehicle for bringing leadership, guidance,
                        and badly needed services and skills to the remotest areas of our land.</p>
                    <p>I take pride in saying that in my estimation no other country in the world,
                        with conditions similar to our own, has been able to achieve this remarkable
                        progress in combating illiteracy and helping provide a better life for its
                        rural citizens. In fact Iran with a population of 25 million has been
                        generally recognized as a pilot country in this field.</p>
                    <p>In the year past, members of the Literacy Corps have built 4649 schools and
                        taught over 320,000 illiterate adults and children. Our ultimate goal is to
                        stamp out illiteracy from our land within the next ten years.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the Health Corps has had a distinguished record of accomplishment
                        in the course of the past year. The medical units of this corps have risen
                        from 117 to 471. These units are scattered in villages all over the country
                        and their services have reached at least 5 million people of our rural
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>Our country has extraordinary potential for industrialization and for genuine
                        economic and social development. In one of our provinces alone, namely
                        Khouzestan, we are able to bring under cultivation no less than one million
                        hectares of land by utilization and application of modern agricultural
                        methods. The vast land of this province will be irrigated by dams already
                        constructed or in the process of construction. In the same province, plans
                        are under way to produce more than seven million kilowatt-hours of
                        energy.</p>
                    <p>Plans are also under way for the vast development of petrochemical and
                        chemical fertilizer industries whose products are estimated to meet the
                        growing needs of our own economy as well as the needs of great neighbouring
                        markets like the sub-continent of India, and even the continent of
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>I need hardly refer to the immensity of our oil production potential. In the
                        Consortium zone alone the potential proven reserves would permit us to
                        produce some four million barrels of oil per day over the next 50 years.</p>
                    <p>The increase in oil exports together with the development of our gas and
                        petrochemical industries, no doubt, are bound to expand our foreign exchange
                        earnings by 1970. But evidently the importance we attach to the economic
                        development of the country and the necessity of making utmost use of our
                        foreign exchange resources for this purpose would make it difficult for us
                        to meet all of our security needs from our foreign exchange earnings for the
                        period 1966–70.</p>
                    <p>It is our confident hope that by 1970 our total revenues from the oil
                        consortium agreement, and income accrued from petrochemical and gas <pb
                            n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0254"/>industries and other sources would
                        exceed the annual sum of $1,500 million. In the meantime, that is between
                        now and 1970, however, we might experience some difficulty in making our
                        limited foreign exchange meet the growing deffense requirements.</p>
                    <p>We are allocating, at present, 70% of our oil revenues for development
                        purposes. In the course of the past year our economic growth has risen by
                        10%, while general price stability has been maintained and in some cases the
                        prices have shown a downward trend. In order to keep up this pace of growth
                        and to assure the continuation of our revolutionary programs, we are making
                        every effort to accelerate the economic development of the country.</p>
                    <p>We are strongly determined to stand on our own feet and to undertake the
                        responsibilities of an independent and peace-loving nation with vital
                        interests in the security and stability of this area—a policy which should
                        be welcome to our friends. Thus in the present uncertain conditions and in
                        the face of real dangers in this part of the world we cannot ignore the
                        defense needs of the country. We should be well prepared to cope with any
                        eventuality. If we are strong enough to face these dangers, they may even
                        fail to materialize.</p>
                    <p>It was in consideration of these facts that our Parliament, in addition to

                        to which we can be accommodated. I would also be pleased to have your

                        you have so far extended to us.</p>
                    <p>Let me say in conclusion that I am in complete agreement with you in that

                        <item>After twenty-five years on the throne of Iran, the Shah is for the
                            first time acting like an independent monarch. He is fashioning his own
                            image as a modern-minded, progressive ruler, no longer in the shadow of
                            the memory of <persName>Reza Shah</persName>, his iron-willed and
                            despotic father, founder of the dynasty.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>
                            <persName>Reza Shah</persName> abdicated in 1941 in the face of British
                            and Russian invasion of his country. The 22-year-old Mohammad inherited
                            a discredited dynasty, the victim of a shameful defeat, and obviously
                            dependent upon foreign support. There was no national unity. Courtiers
                            and self-seeking politicians confused the frustrated young monarch, and
                            bad advice came from all sides. His first two marriages produced no male
                            heir, a failure which he took as another symbol of his weakness.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The showdown with Premier Mossadeq between 1951 and 1953 was a turning
                            point. When Mossadeq fell, the Shah triumphantly returned from brief
                            exile and began taking direct, forceful charge of his country. His
                            confidence has grown constantly since then. There is today no challenge
                            to his throne, the political opposition is in disarray, and his third
                            wife has produced a Crown Prince, now five years old.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Economically the country is in good shape, and the Shah is confidently
                            proceeding with what he calls his “White Revolution,” a broad program of
                            modernization and reform. Concurrently, he has broken his exclusive
                            reliance on the US and is well on his way toward a more independent
                            position between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                            He is convinced that this course will enhance his image both
                            domestically and internationally, but in following it he risks moving
                            further away from the US than he now intends.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Shah's recent acceptance of a Soviet steel mill—a project on which
                            the West had dragged its feet for many years—is a testimony to his new
                            feeling of confidence. But it is also a major breakthrough for the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The mill will be the core of
                            Iran's industrial development program, and will result in the influx of
                            hundreds of Soviet technicians over the next few years. It nonetheless
                            gives substance to the Shah's repeated warnings that, while he does not
                            intend to change his country's pro-Western orientation, he will not
                            hesitate to go elsewhere if the US cannot meet his needs, and has been
                            warmly welcomed by the Iranian public.</item>

                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The Shah acknowledges the danger from the U.S.S.R., but insists on his
                            ability to deal with Moscow without serious risk. In his eyes, the only
                            immediate threat to Iran comes from those Arab states, including Iraq,
                            which he sees as dominated by Nasir. For defense against this threat, he
                            believes Iran needs faster fighter aircraft, better air defense, and a
                            strong-er navy in the Persian Gulf, primarily to protect the vital
                            southern oil regions. The Shah is no longer willing to listen to US
                            arguments that Iran cannot afford such equipment. Oil revenues are
                            increasing, and he is pressing the foreign oil companies for even
                            greater production. He has received a credit authorization from
                            parliament for $200 million to buy arms.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>For logistical reasons, the Shah prefers to buy U.S. equipment, but
                            will probably turn instead to Western European countries if the U.S. is
                            not forthcoming. He has intimated that as a last resort he might turn to
                            the U.S.S.R. Such a move would represent a turning point in his
                            relations with the West and could, if carried out on a large scale,
                            accomplish a major current Soviet objective, the withdrawal of the U.S.
                            military mission in Iran.</item>

                        arms. He details his achievements—combating illiteracy, improving rural life

                        of a fertilizer industry. Then he explains how growing oil earnings should
                        put Iran on its feet by 1970. Between now and then, however, he will need
                        help in building an effective military while continuing to devote most of

                    <p>Iran's signal progress in education and literacy, in health, in social and
                        economic development, and in agriculture, recounted in your letter of March
                        25, is most impressive. I sense your pride and I share your pleasure in
                        these accomplishments.</p>
                    <p>I fully understand the importance that you attach to making the necessary
                        defense decisions that will protect and promote Iran's security and
                        progress. To that end my government is earnestly making a careful
                        examination of the defense and security situation as it affects us both—what
                        Iran's needs are and how the United States can help to meet them. The report
                        of the military survey team is now under review by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        and the Department of Defense. One purpose of this review, the necessity for
                        which I am sure Your Majesty can appreciate, is to determine the most
                        favorable prices that can be offered for the equipment recommended by the
                        military survey team. Once this is completed, the report will be forwarded
                        to you to permit thorough study by your government before the Annual
                        Review.</p>

                        the Annual Review. Once both military and economic data are in hand and have
                        been analyzed, I believe our two governments should be able to reach a
                        prompt conclusion as to our future military cooperation.</p>

                            Soviet objective which is clear from regular Moscow broadcasts is
                            interdiction of West's oil supply from Mideast; Soviet arms are

                            command structure, etc. Its collapse, however, would be victory for
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>'s critics. Shah said

                            should be carefully studied. As for himself, he would like to see

                            not clear and Shah has not broached subject to Paks or Afghans. It
                            doubtful if Turkey could be included because of its <gloss

                            giving some thought to revivification of Saababad Pact. He frankly
                            admitted there no ready-made alternative to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                                >CENTO</gloss> but all alternatives should be seriously studied.

                    <p>The Foreign Minister, noting that he was speaking at the Shah's request,
                        raised the question of “the purchase of arms, which was very dear <pb
                            n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>to His Majesty's heart.” He
                        referred to the recent exchange of correspondence between President Johnson
                        and the Shah, and said that His Majesty had been very pleased with the last
                        reply from the President. He stated that the Shah was waiting anxiously to
                        see what General <persName>Peterson</persName>'s report on Iranian arms
                        requirements would conclude. His Majesty felt that Iran was a stable country
                        in the midst of a number of less stable nations, and that it was to the
                        advantage of Iran's friends that she remain stable. She had to be strong,
                        therefore, but in fact she was weak in the Persian Gulf and her air force
                        was inferior to Iraq's. Thus, His Majesty wants very much to purchase arms
                        from the U.S. on favorable terms, but if the terms were unfavorable Iran
                        would have to look elsewhere. The Foreign Minister hoped that the U.S. would
                        not take offense at this kind of statement, for Iran remained a staunch
                        friend of the U.S. Rather it was a matter of the independence of the country
                        and of her stability.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we understood and would examine carefully the Shah's
                        proposals in a helpful spirit. The Secretary said that we did not take
                        offense. His Majesty is responsible for Iran and we are responsible for the
                        U.S. And we are two strong, independent, self-respecting peoples. The
                        Foreign Minister stated that he would like to have something to carry back
                        to the Shah about the possibility of purchase of arms in the U.S., and the
                        Secretary asked Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
                            >Hare</persName> to cable Washington to determine the status of the
                        Military Mission's report. We will try to have something soon for the
                        Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that His Majesty was a remarkable man, always looking
                        ahead and anxious to achieve great performance. If the Shah reflected back
                        ten or fifteen years, he might well conclude that Iran had never been more
                        secure or economically sound and might feel reassured at her success, for
                        which he himself had been largely responsible. We understood his nervousness
                        about Baghdad and Egypt, but those were minor league threats compared to the
                        Soviet threat which had been much more serious.</p>

                            General Aryana and Shah. Total package recommended by report is
                            estimated to cost approximately $308 million. While it is possible that
                            cost may be reduced by such factors as greater equipment austerity,
                            lower usage rates, lower maintenance requirements, reduced volume of
                            supporting equipment, greater in-country maintenance and overhaul, and
                            later delivery dates, these factors have already been partially applied
                            to original cost-out which was substantially higher than $308 million.
                            Therefore major further reductions may be difficult to achieve.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>An additional factor is requirement for about $80 million to fund
                            remaining items in Annex B to 1964 Memorandum of Understanding (Hawk
                            battalion, M–60 tanks, and electronics gear) as against a remaining $60
                            million of uncommitted credit. Therefore to fund both these agreed items
                            and total <persName>Peterson</persName> package would require new credit
                            of about $328 million. This in turn would require raising Iranian credit
                            ceiling from present $200 million to $528 million.</item>

                        <item>State, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and Defense agree that
                            Iran's total credit should be held within a $400 million ceiling, given
                            Iran's foreign exchange position, estimated future revenues, and
                            economic development needs. Also, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            funds required to guarantee loans by other institutions are expected to
                            be relatively stringent. Therefore, even if Team report is considered to
                            reflect legitimate military requirements, it will be necessary inform
                            Shah that credit limitations will force a deferment of substantial
                            elements of package beyond 1971. We concur in proposed priority items
                            for deferments as set forth in sanitized version of report, but would
                            expect give Shah wide discretion in determining mix of US-approved
                            items. They would reduce new credit requirement by about $144 million or
                            down to approximately $184 million. When added to present credit of <pb
                                n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0264"/>$200 million, this would hold
                            total credit within desired $400 million ceiling. At same time, we
                            believe these particular deferments would not adversely affect planned
                            improvement of Iran's air defense and naval capability which we
                            understand is Shah's primary concern.</item>

                            suggested in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. Shah said while
                            Iran might not require equipment of too much sophistication, as far as
                            spare parts, training and usage concerned he could not treat his
                            military personnel with less care than US treats its military
                            personnel.</item>

                            total ceiling of $400 million ($200 million envisaged in 1964 Memo of
                            Understanding plus $200 million authorized last fall by Iran
                            Parliament), I noted that some items would have to be deferred but Shah
                            would have discretion in determining mix of US-approved items. Shah said
                            he has no intention of spending dollar more than is necessary, but he
                            cannot “play with fate” of his country. Once again he called attention
                            to billions of dollars of wealth in southern Iran and said it would be
                            foolish to risk its loss for few million dollars. He considers these
                            expenditures as “insurance.” In this connection, he said “recent
                            developments” (Nasser's threats against territory of Saudi Arabia) prove
                            that his concern is not idle and that possibility cannot be ruled out
                            that Nasser's influence will reach Persian Gulf area. I, as usual,
                            expressed view he is overestimating imminence and nature of such
                            danger.</item>

                        <item>Later in discussion, Shah said he has report that Turks are seeking
                            $2,000 million in new military assistance from US, including 3,000
                            tanks, I expressed doubt. Comment: In Shah's mind there is obviously
                            contrast re what <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> providing Turkey
                            via grant as over against much lesser amount we willing to permit his
                            more opulent country to buy. PriMin yesterday also asked me re Turk aid,
                            noting <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has received report from its

                        <item>Shah concluded conversation by expressing hope <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> will realize importance of “solidifyingquot; its

                            with us. I assured him it remains our desire to have healthy
                            relationship with Iran, noting, however, at same time that America is
                            bearing heavy burdens notably Viet-Nam which sometimes limit what we are

                                queries regarding the price of each item in the proposed program;
                                and 2) the need for expediting and increasing the number of

                        <item>U.S.-Iranian relations may reach a critical point this month over the
                            issues of Iranian military purchases and the Iranian drive to increase
                            oil revenues. An annual joint survey of the Iranian economy is under way
                            now, and the report of the U.S. Military Survey Team to Iran
                                (<persName>Peterson</persName> Report) has been completed and was
                            submitted to the Shah on 4 May. Analysis of these two reports in
                            Washington will determine the extent to which large Iranian military
                            expenditures in the US are economically feasible. In addition, the Oil
                            Consortium will determine this month how much to increase its oil
                            offtake (exports) from Iran. The Shah considers a large increase
                            essential to finance his military and economic programs.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Shah is determined to make major military purchases in the near
                            future to bolster defenses in oil-rich southern Iran and in the Persian
                            Gulf, which he believes are endangered by the ambitions of Egyptian
                            President Nasir. The Iranian parliament in November approved additional
                            military expenditures of up to $200 million. The Shah would prefer to
                            make these purchases in the US, but has made it clear that he will turn
                            elsewhere if this proves too difficult.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The U.S. takes the position that these purchases can be approved only
                            in the context of an annual joint review of the Iranian economy. The
                            annual review grows out of a U.S.-Iranian Memo of Understanding in 1964.
                            In essence, the review provides economic information which Washington
                            will analyze to determine whether Iran can afford increased military
                            expenditures and still maintain rapid economic development. The Shah
                            finds such limitations irritating and insulting, particularly in the
                            light of his new “independent” foreign policy.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The arms issue is complicated by the completion of the
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> Report. This report appears to be more
                            in line with the Shah's thinking—it acknowledges the Arab threat to
                            Iranian security and recommends stronger defenses in the southern
                            provinces and the Persian Gulf. The additional recommended armaments
                            would require a credit of $328 million over the $200 million credit
                            extended under the 1964 agreement.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>However, the State Department has tentatively determined (pending
                            completion of the annual review) that the new credit must not <pb
                                n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0267"/>exceed $184 million, thus
                            requiring that the Shah postpone a substantial portion of the arms
                            purchases until after 1971. In addition, the US Embassy in Teheran has
                            expressed its concern over the magnitude of the prices listed in the
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> Report, and fears that the Shah will
                            be disturbed also. Thus, although all the Shah's wished-for purchases
                            except a prestigious destroyer apparently will be approved in principle,
                            the Shah may well find the delay on some items, and the prices,
                            unacceptable. Completion of the annual review probably will not
                            substantially alter the US position. It is quite conceivable that the
                            Shah will use the <persName>Peterson</persName> Report to counter State
                            Department arguments against immediate heavy expenditures.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The oil issue is locked in closely with the foregoing. Members of the
                            Oil Consortium may reach a decision this month on the rate at which they
                            will increase oil offtake. As of late April, the member companies were
                            thinking in terms of a 10.5-percent, or at most 12-percent, increase
                            over 1965 production. The Shah insists, however, that the rate must be
                            at least 17 percent if Iran is to carry out its economic and military
                            programs without “reorienting” its trade pattern. Both the US and
                            British companies in the consortium argue that they are producing as
                            fast as possible, and each group accuses the other of holding back
                            production. A final meeting was scheduled for 10 May, but apparently has
                            been temporarily postponed because the Shah has invited some company
                            heads to Teheran for discussions later in May. The US fears the
                            consequences of a major confrontation between Iran and the consortium,
                            and has been encouraging US companies to raise their production as much
                            as possible.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Shah, bolstered by his rapprochement with the Soviets and by
                            political stability and economic growth at home, has exhibited an
                            increasingly independent spirit in the past year. He is determined to
                            obtain new military equipment soon, and there is little doubt that he
                            will turn elsewhere if the U.S. does not sell quickly and on favorable
                            terms. He has felt for some time that the US takes Iranian friendship
                            for granted, and he regards the arms question as a crucial test of US
                            support and sincerity. He is equally determined to increase oil
                            revenues, and may well be serious in his threat to shift at least part
                            of Iran's trade to the East, where export prices are lower and terms are
                            easier. This could, in turn, put a brake on the growing US private
                            investment in Iran, as well as affect our general politico-military
                            relationship with the country.</item>

                        chiefly to get your personal greetings for the Shah. However, he is here to
                        work out our position on a new $200 million arms sales package, which he
                        will be discussing with the Iranians next week at our annual joint
                        economic-military review. You will get a formal recommendation shortly.
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> feels the Shah should not spend his
                        money on arms because the purchase could strain his resources to the point
                        of requiring renewed U.S. budget support. State believes the Shah is
                        determined to buy—he has told you so in his last two letters—so our best bet
                        is to try to control his buying by selling ourselves. So you may want to

                                    State had, however, occasionally offered judgments, to the Shah,
                                    on this subject. I referred to the dangers inherent in the
                                    practice of reacting to the exaggerated “estimates” from the
                                    Shah and others by calming them with watered-down estimative
                                    judgements deprecating the long-term Soviet indirect threat in
                                    the Near East. I expressed the opinion that these “bogus
                                    estimates” tended to gain currency and validity within the

                                    the Shah if it were wrapped in the trappings of a real gesture

                        <item>As you may know, my efforts last week in Washington to assure

                            additional military sales here. His understandable reasons: a) general
                            Washington antipathy to military programs particularly following
                                Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> conflict last year: and b)
                            concern that military expenditures will jeopardize Iran's economic
                            development.</item>

                        <item>Even without <persName>Peterson</persName> confirmation, Shah is
                            convinced Iran needs additional equipment. It not possible to dissuade
                            him from securing adequate air defense for wealth-bearing southern
                            region of Iran and some additional naval craft to assure stability of
                            Gulf as traditional British power diminishes. Economically, Shah tends
                            to bite off more than he can chew but recent history demonstrates
                            projects never progress as rapidly as anticipated and this tends to
                            relieve financial indigestion. In any case at present Iran is thriving
                            and generally justified optimism prevails here re future.</item>

                        <item>There is no doubt Shah means it when he says he will buy elsewhere if

                            that cannot be excluded. Our conviction is that maintenance of US-Iran
                            military relationship is best bet for keeping Shah from going off deep

                            expressing hope that his five months' wait would be followed by adequate
                            US responsiveness but if not he determined make other arrangements. Shah
                            cited Kosygin's visit to Cairo as compounding concern engendered by
                            Nasser's threats against Saudi Arabia and Nasser's announcement that

                            Malinovsky here.” Such talk is, of course, obnoxious and may also have
                            had purpose of influencing our views. At same time, I remember
                            Ambassador <persName>Henry Grady</persName> telegraphically commenting
                            before breakdown of oil industry here that some people think Iranians

                        <item>All this does not mean we should jump through hoop when Shah snaps
                            fingers. <persName>Peterson</persName> Mission reduced Shah's demands to
                            justifiable requirements. Beyond this, equipment recommended by
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> will exceed in cost $200,000,000
                            supplementary loan authorization which Shah has received from

                            program, Shah is going to have to make some choices. In any case, during
                            our discussion of these matters I intend to bear down heavily on need
                            for keeping military expenditures from wrecking economic progress which

                        <item>Iranian foreign and military policies are heavily influenced by the
                            Shah's belief that Arab nationalism, personified by Egyptian President
                            Nasir, is striving to dominate oil-rich and vulnerable south-western
                            Iran and the Persian Gulf area. His concern has been heightened by the
                            diminishing role of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the Persian

                        <item>From a geopolitical standpoint, the Shah's fears for the security of
                            southwestern Iran and the Persian Gulf are not groundless. The oil
                            facilities in Khuzistan Province and the offshore islands provide nearly
                            75 percent of Iran's foreign exchange earnings, and hence are the
                            primary source of Iranian economic development funds. These highly
                            concentrated facilities provide extremely vulnerable targets for
                            sabotage.</item>

                        <item>Iranian transportation routes to the Western world are also
                            vulnerable. The major ocean port, Khorramshahr, can be reached only
                            through the Iraqi-controlled Shatt-al-Arab waters. A hostile Arab
                            sheikdom at the Strait of Hormuz—the mouth of the Persian Gulf—could
                            endanger all Iranian shipping into the Indian Ocean. Iran is attempting
                            to decentralize the oil industry, and to open new ports along the Gulf
                            beyond Iraq's control. The most important new facility will be the port
                            at Bandar <persName>Abbas</persName>, on the Iranian side of the Strait
                            of Hormuz. This will also be Iran's main naval base. Bandar
                                <persName>Abbas</persName> is not expected to be completed before
                            1968, however.</item>

                        <item>Psychological and political factors have led the Shah to believe that
                            Arab nationalism presents a “clear and present danger” to Iranian
                            security. He bitterly resents Nasir's claim to leadership of
                            “progressive forces” in the Middle East against “reactionaries”
                            (including the Shah), especially in view of his ambitious social
                            “revolution” in Iran. The Shah feels that he has been insulted by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s break-off of diplomatic
                            relations in 1960 and by Nasir's subsequent propaganda attacks against
                            his country and himself. He may fear, too, that Nasir's brand of
                            aggressive and neutralist nationalism, and his charisma, will prove
                            infectious to some Iranians.</item>

                            incidents between Iranian and Iraqi troops in the course of the Kurdish
                            rebellion have added fuel to the fire in the Shah's mind. There have
                            also been reports of arms shipments from Iraq to dissidents among the
                            Qashqai and Baluchi tribes. The Shah's predilection to believe the worst
                            of Nasir leads him to put all available facts, rumors, intelligence
                            reports, and suspicions into a pattern which proves to him that Nasir is
                            out to overthrow his government.</item>

                        <item>The pattern he sees is an exaggerated version of what Nasir in reality
                            has done and is doing in the way of “threatening” Iranian security.
                            Nasir may well be giving encouragement and some form of covert aid to
                            Arab nationalists conspiring against the Shah. Egypt regularly beams
                            propaganda to Iran—Cairo radio broadcasts in Persian for two hours each
                            day, and a clandestine “Voice of the Iranian Nation” emanates from
                            Egyptian territory for four hours daily. Moreover, Nasir has attacked
                            the Shah directly in recent speeches. Nasir is actively engaged in
                            subversive activity in the Persian Gulf sheikdoms, and his efforts
                            eventually to succeed Britain as the dominant influence among them could
                            be construed with some validity as posing a long-range threat to Iranian
                            transit through the Strait of Hormuz.</item>

                            small 350-man Egyptian force in Iraq, which worries the Shah, is but a
                            token force in the narrowest sense of the term and is designed to
                            influence political developments in Iraq. There are no plans to use it
                            against Iran. The regime of Iraq's late premier Arif, who died in a
                            helicopter crash early this spring, was clearly pro-Nasirist, but did
                            not menace the Shah or his domains. The Arabian majority in Khuzistan is
                            generally inactive politically, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text

                            Kuwait with an office in Syria, probably receives some support from both
                            Cairo and Baghdad, but does not appear to wield much influence in
                            Khuzistan.</item>

                        <item>In responding to the Arab “threat,” the Shah has followed a policy of
                            supporting governments, elements, and activities which might keep his
                            enemies distracted and occupied. The Iranian Government has directed a
                            hostile—sometimes shrill—propaganda campaign against Nasir, both in Iran
                            and abroad. Iran has given military equipment and <pb n="249"

                            rebellion, which keeps a large percentage of Iraqi troops tied up in
                            northern Iraq. [<hi rend="italic">3–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] The Iranians have attempted openly to win support
                            among leaders of the Shi'a minority Islamic group in Iraq. Iran has
                            purchased arms for Saudi Arabia to pass on to the Yemeni royalist
                            forces, and has maintained close liaison with Nasir's primary enemy,
                            Israel. Among the more conservatively ruled Arab states, the Shah has
                            attempted particularly to woo Saudi Arabia and Jordan and has given
                            sympathetic attention to Saudi King Faisal's proposal, which Nasir
                            opposes, regarding Islamic solidarity. There is even evidence that the
                            Shah hoped that his rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                            over Nasir—although Premier Kosygin's recent visit to Egypt may have
                            dashed those faint hopes.</item>

                        <item>The Shah lays most emphasis, however, on bolstering Iranian defenses,
                            particularly naval and air, in the Persian Gulf and southwestern Iran. A
                            considerable defense build-up would be necessary to provide a credible
                            deterrent for hostile Arab countries—which presently have substantial
                            military superiority, at least in an order-of-battle sense—were they in
                            fact bent on attacking Iran. The Shah suspects, moreover, that in the
                            event of an attack, the U.S. might be caught in the middle and might
                            even stop selling arms, as it did to Pakistan during the conflict with
                            India last fall. U.S. economic assistance to Nasir tends to bolster the
                            Shah's conviction that he would have to stand alone against the Arabs.
                            He gives every sign of being determined to add substantially to his
                            country's armaments, whether or not the U.S. Government agrees with his
                            assessment of the Arab threat, and has made it clear that he will go
                            elsewhere if he cannot purchase additional military equipment quickly
                            and on desirable terms from the U.S. (<gloss target="#t_MAP1"

                        State eventually agreed that this doesn't make sense. A 4% rate on a $200

                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> fears he will end up asking us to bail him
                        out of a foreign exchange bind just when we are phasing out of economic
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">But since he is determined to buy arms somewhere, the best
                            we can do is to lean on the brakes.</hi> His parliament appropriated
                        $200 million last fall, and only by sending a survey team have we delayed
                        him this long. We will probably want him to let us set up in Iran a partial
                        alternative to our intelligence facilities in Pakistan (we will re-open this
                        with you soon). Anyway, if we cannot dissuade him, no point in losing a good
                        sale.</p>

                    <p>While on balance this package makes sense, we want to be flexible in case
                        Iran's economy sags. We want <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> to
                        keep a close eye on the economics and not tie you too firmly to a long-range
                        commitment, thereby losing the leverage of a short leash.</p>
                    <p>So I recommend you approve but authorize me to read back to State this
                        indication of your feelings: “The President is deeply concerned over Iran's
                        worrisome economic prospects. He wants each slice of this new program
                        submitted to him for approval only after searching review of Iran's economic
                        position. He regards the new $200 million as a planning figure subject to
                        annual review. He asks that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName> tell the Shah of this concern, while reassuring him of
                        the President's full respect for his judgment.” Charlie <persName

                        <item>You should also inform Shah orally as follows: It is our view total

                            cash purchases could prove overly heavy burden for Iran's economy. For
                            this reason we continue attach great importance to our joint annual
                            military/economic review which will allow us to form economic
                            conclusions bearing on release of annual tranches. These reviews will
                            necessarily consider, among other things, substantial additional
                            military purchases. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We assume
                            annual review already agreed to would allow for consultations on

                            therefore specific amendment of 1964 Memorandum of Understanding to
                            provide for consultations on this not necessary. President considers new
                            $200 million as planning figure, a commitment in principle on condition
                            that our joint economic review confirms feasibility in light Iran's
                            economic position. You should impress concern re economic burden on
                            Shah, in context above, while reassuring him of President's full respect

                            formulated by our associates in Washington. It is to be presented to the
                            Shah as soon as your approval has been obtained.<note n="3"

                                package proposal. (Ibid., DEF 19–8 U.S.-IRAN)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>While considerably more restricted than is compatible with protection of
                            our interests, the package proposal reflects careful attention and an
                            effort to be as forthcoming as Washington circumstances and the U.S.'s
                            view as to Iran's capabilities permit. As your Ambassador to this
                            country, I am nonetheless concerned that we are about to alienate the
                            Shah and his country with whom we have had a long and mutually
                            beneficial friendship. My concern is of sufficient depth to warrant
                            taking a few minutes of your valuable time to request relatively small
                            modifications which may be able to reduce adverse repercussions to
                            manageable proportion.</p>
                        <p>My week in Washington made clear the antipathy which exists both in our
                            legislative and executive branches to military programs, particularly
                            following the Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> debacle last
                            fall. This is fully understandable. But it makes very difficult the
                            maintenance of healthy relationships with true friends like Iran with
                            whom we have a long-standing military relationship. Due to massive
                            Soviet arms shipments to this region, the vulnerability of Iran (like
                            Israel) has sharply increased. The Shah six months ago became so
                            concerned he obtained authorization from his Parliament for an
                            additional $200,000,000 borrowing authority to build up his air and
                            naval defenses. His purpose is to deter aggressive action against Iran's
                            vulnerable oil producing areas or to cope with such aggression if it
                            takes place. Deeply impressed by the Vietnam situation, the Shah
                            believes such self-reliance is in U.S. as well as Iran's interest. A
                            seven-man team of U.S. military experts under Brig. Gen.
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> assessed the situation in March. In a
                            report (which the Shah has in his possession)
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> confirmed that a threat truly exists
                            and recommended a rational program for augmentation within the
                            $200,000,000 added ceiling. Thus, the judgment that early measures
                            should be taken is not only the Shah's but our own.</p>
                        <p>A main concern in Washington is the effect of military expenditures on
                            Iran's economic development. At present, Iran is thriving. With his
                            profound sense of mission, the Shah is making Iran a show-case of
                            modernization in this part of the world (8–10 percent growth rate,
                            utilization of 75 percent of the $500,000,000 annual oil income for
                            development purposes, land reform, literacy corps, etc.). The problem is
                            he may bite off more than he can chew. It is the Embassy's view,
                            however, that as in the past, major projects (and their financing) will
                            stretch out over a considerably longer period than planned. While we, of
                            course, regret any diversion of Iran's resources to military
                            expenditures, we are convinced <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"
                            />favorable economic factors are such that Iran can meet the financial
                            burdens of a military program along lines envisaged in the
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> Report without courting disaster. In
                            any case, economic difficulties are more apt to be forestalled if we at
                            this Embassy are enabled (by adequate responsiveness to the
                                <persName>Peterson</persName> recommendations) to maintain a healthy
                            dialogue with the Shah and his Government.</p>
                        <p>This brings me to my greatest concern with the proposed package. The
                            underlying assumption appears to be that the U.S. Government can compel
                            the Shah to obtain only such equipment as we decide he can have. This is
                            altogether unrealistic in 1966. Time and again over the past few months
                            the Shah has said, privately and publicly, that Iran is its own master.
                            He has made this clear (again in a lengthy talk with us yesterday)
                            specifically as far as arms purchasing is concerned. I do not foresee
                            the possibility of attaining his agreement to a documentary amendment,
                            as presently proposed, requiring him to consult with us “on the
                            magnitude and terms of major purchases outside this arrangement.” It is
                            true he will only with greatest reluctance give up the benefits of a
                            package proposal but he will in my view balk at being put in a strait
                            jacket. Even if it proved possible to obtain his concurrence, rancor
                            would be deep and he would inevitably violate this injunction. Then we
                            would be faced with a showdown in our total relationship here.</p>
                        <p>Instead of a “Papa knows best” attitude, excessive manipulation of which
                            is in my view to a considerable extent responsible for anti-Americanism
                            in this part of the world, I believe we would get much further by
                            treating the Shah like an adult. In our 1964 Memorandum of Understanding
                            we already have provisions similar to the one proposed. We can refer to
                            them if necessary. In any case, I feel strongly that in the realm of
                            human affairs one gets farther by reasoning together than by
                            coercion.</p>
                        <p>I will, of course, try my best to sell whatever final package you
                            authorize. It would have been helpful to have a concessional interest
                            rate, particularly to induce a favorable climate for installation of
                            augmented special U.S. intelligence facilities. That apparently is not
                            possible. What should be possible, however, in addition to “favorable
                            prices,” which you mentioned to the Shah in your letter of April

                                    four years. The problem is that there is usually a two or
                                    three-year delay in delivery after credit funds are arranged. It
                                    would be important to be able to assure the Shah: <list>

                    <p>In November you tentatively approved a recommendation from <persName

                            >McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWFJ1">Raborn</persName>
                        for establishing contingency alternatives for our intelligence facilities in
                        Pakistan. But you felt we ought to hold final decision until after you
                        talked with Ayub. Then we held further until after Tashkent and the Indian
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Now State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have reviewed
                        their October recommendations and (with minor updating) feel we should go
                        ahead. They emphasize that this is not a proposal to relocate most of the
                        present activities from Pakistan or to duplicate them. They propose to
                        develop minimum space and install basic equipment so we can diversify some
                        of these activities and be in a position to move them all on short notice
                        with little intelligence loss if need be.</p>
                    <p>To refresh your memory, they recommended we: (a) increase existing [<hi
                            rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] (b) add one
                        floor to a planned warehouse in the embassy compound in Tehran; (c) acquire
                        land outside Tehran for eventually developing a more satisfactory permanent
                        installation (including dependent quarters) if needed; and [<hi
                            rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>Costs of (a) and (b) would be about $1.5 million; time about 9 months. Cost
                        of (c) is approximately $5 million with eventual cost depending on how
                        extensively we develop that site; time about 18 months. [<hi rend="italic">3
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>As general guidelines, they recommend (a) no further investment in Pakistan;
                        (b) as new facilities come into being, we transfer some of those now in
                        Pakistan to reduce the leverage any one country holds over us; but (c)
                        unless you decide otherwise or the Paks kick us out, we retain a substantial
                        portion of our present <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> activities.</p>
                    <p>They also recommended certain sweeteners for Iran to develop the favorable
                        political climate essential to expansion. Your recent approval of the new
                        military sales package has brought those up to date.</p>
                    <p>The balance of payments impact would be minimal; all equipment would be
                        US-built. One-time real estate and construction costs would be about $6
                        million, and annual recurring costs about $750,000 (much of which would be
                        offset by reduction of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> facilities).</p>
                    <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0289"/>
                    <p>I believe it makes sense to go ahead with this program now. Since we no
                        longer have the kind of close relationship with Pakistan we had prior to the
                        Chinese attack on India, we would be well to reinsure.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Shah has expressed disappointment with Iran's 1965 crude oil export
                        figures and considers a substantial increase during 1966 necessary to
                        finance his plans for economic development and an expanded defense
                        establishment. This paper explores the background of recent discussions on
                        this subject and its relationship to the Shah's attitude toward the US.</p>

                    <p>The Shah considers the 1965 increase in crude oil offtake inadequate in view
                        of Iran's financial needs for its economic development and defense. <pb
                            n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>Iranian officials assert that the
                        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (<gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss>) authorized a 20 per cent increase in offtake for Iran in
                        1966 (almost twice the 1965 increase). However, <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> has not made a public announcement of allotments, and the
                        oil Consortium (which insists that <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                        allotments are not binding on the producing companies) notified the Iranian
                        Government on May 25 that it planned to increase oil liftings by about 9–11
                        per cent in 1966. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1"
                            >Hoveyda</persName> has already termed this increase “unsatisfactory”
                        and “unacceptable.” The Shah has threatened to go elsewhere for military and
                        economic assistance if the US does not provide what he wants, and Iranian
                        officials have the impression that the Consortium could have promised
                        greater oil offtake had the US applied pressure on the American companies
                        who are members. As a result of the Iranian dissatisfaction, the Shah is
                        likely to become more intransigent in his dealings with the US. However, if
                        the Consortium maintains a unified position on the issue of oil offtake, it
                        is possible that the Shah will be obliged to proceed in a more pragmatic
                        fashion toward a resolution of the conflicting demands of military
                        modernization and economic development on Iran's limited resources.</p>

                        <item>Noting in our meeting previous to his departure we had been able to
                            inform him of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> readiness to provide
                            additional $200,000,000 in credit for military purchases over next five

                            worked into program acceptable to him. Important point was to get on
                            with job of figuring out third tranche bearing in mind <gloss

                        <item>Shah said he had every intention being “reasonable.” He repeatedly
                            expressed appreciation for what <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has
                            done for Iran in military field in past and his desire that healthiness
                            this relationship will continue. At same time, he referred to
                            predicament in which Pakistan had found itself last fall and since that
                            time due to suspension of US military supplies. He considered <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s policy misguided for in his view US
                            has driven Paks as regards military procurement into arms of Chinese and
                            also Russians, <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> military mission
                            currently being in Moscow. All this, he said, has given him much cause
                            for thought. He has, he said, reached a conclusion as far as Iranian
                            military procurement policy is concerned. If <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> shows itself responsive, Shah said he wishes to
                            maintain maximum supply relationship with traditional U.S. supplier.
                            This is particularly true, he said, for lethal and sensitive items such
                            as aircraft. He pointed out that once a pilot is in air he is beyond
                            control and can in fact turn against his country. Hence Shah wants
                            aircraft program in safe American hands. Other items such as
                            anti-aircraft equipment do not present same opportunities for subversive
                            potential. Therefore, if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> unwilling
                            supply such items at reasonable prices and terms, they can be procured
                            elsewhere.</item>

                        <item>Turning to spread sheet of <persName>Peterson</persName> approved
                            items (except destroyer) and their costs, Shah quickly concentrated on
                            items he wants to order from U.S. without delay: Blue Shark system,
                            remaining 209 M–60 tanks, F–4 aircraft, and 30-day war reserve for three
                            services. Later in discussion, <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                                >Jablonsky</persName> was able to persuade Shah at least for this
                            year to limit additional war reserve to air force only.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Shah laid greatest emphasis on F–4 aircraft. He was particularly upset
                            by limitation to one squadron. One squadron, he observed, would only be
                            enough for two or three planes at each airfield. This was totally
                            unacceptable. Also unacceptable, he said, is 1970 target date. Noting
                            how Soviets have already supplied and are continuing to supply MIG–21's
                            to their friends, notably Iraq, Shah said, “We are faced with the
                            problem right now.”</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>As to F–4 pricing, Shah considers price of $39 million for 12 aircraft
                            high, although he did not describe it as unacceptable. He said French
                            Mirages have been offered at $1.1 million per copy “naked” and $1.6
                            million “complete.” French have guaranteed to have first Mirage in
                            country in 20 months and total order within 32 months. He noted he could
                            buy at least two Mirages for price of each F–4. At same time, he said,
                            he realized F–4 is much better aircraft. He indicated he would think
                            about this offer for “a week or ten days” (later he said until July 4)
                            but his interest ultimately dependent on obtaining two squadrons and
                            earlier delivery.</item>

                        <item>Question of destroyer never came up during conversation. Shah,
                            however, at one point gave clear indication that he is tending toward
                            British deal (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1594).<note

                        <item>Later in discussion when I urged Shah to keep in mind that his F–5 is
                            good aircraft, which is doing yeoman work in Vietnam, Shah disclosed “in
                            confidence” that an Israeli pilot had been here recently, had flown the
                            F–5, and contrasted it disparagingly with Mirages which Israelis
                            possess.</item>

                        <item>When we noted Shah had not indicated interest in anti-aircraft
                            equipment, Shah said he thought he could get such equipment, as opposed
                            to “sensitive” aircraft, from elsewhere, probably from Russians. He
                            asked re effectiveness of Russian <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s
                            in Vietnam and <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>
                            reported they only having limited success. Shah noted that until now he
                            has not approached Russians, only British and French. (Implication was
                            that British and French offers not very attractive.) Re Tiger Cat, Shah
                            acknowledged it had only limited value.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>When I expressed personal hope that Shah could avoid arms procurement
                            from Russians and indicated how it would complicate matters for us, Shah
                            took firm stand. Rest of conversation was heavily punctuated with his
                            insistence that Iran simply must have “liberty of action.” He said he
                            hoped <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would understand that his
                            ideals are same as ours and that “even behind our backs he supports U.S.
                            on Vietnam” but Iran's main concern is to “stand on its own feet,” from
                            security as well as economic and political standpoints. Instead of
                            acting irritated, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should realize
                            that Iran's independent stance is best possible roadblock to Communist
                            influence.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Shah went on to say that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has had
                            no compunctions about providing arms to other countries which also
                            procure arms from Soviets. He noted specifically India, Iraq and
                            Yugoslavia. I mentioned those were different circumstances. India was
                            faced with Chinese aggression. Shah retorted India used American arms
                            against Paks. I noted equipment to Iraq was limited and cash sales. Shah
                            said bitterly <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> always finds “excuses”
                            for such deals with countries which persistently side against US in
                            world affairs while at same time making life as difficult as possible
                            for US's true friends.</item>

                        <item>Re Pakistan, I noted we apparently assess last fall's episode somewhat
                            differently. I said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> considers it
                            acted in Pakistan's “higher interest” by inducing an early end to
                            conflict instead of fueling war further. Shah retorted tartly all US did
                            was to hurt Pakistan, its ostensible ally, while Indians continued to
                            receive arms from other suppliers.</item>

                            ability to stand on its own feet, and there is no divergence of opinion
                            in Washington on this score. In fact, <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265"
                                facs="0293"/>most Americans are so gratified they are concerned that
                            Iran's remarkable progress not be jeopardized by excessive expenditures
                            for arms.</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>Expressing full confidence in Shah's ability to keep situation on even
                            keel, I noted clandestine Soviet broadcasts and wondered about wisdom of
                            opening further opportunities for Soviets via arms procurement,
                            non-sensitive or sensitive. Shah was quick to emphasize that broadcasts
                            are aimed at him and his regime. This all more reason, he said, why
                            Iran's best hope lies in “independent” stance which frustrates Communist
                            attempts to drive wedge between Shah and his people. I took occasion
                            also to note that extent of shift in Iranian policy is already
                            misleading some of Iranian opinion, e.g. almost daily attacks in some of
                            lesser Iranian newspapers and a general cooling of atmosphere here
                            against Americans. This too, is Soviet aim, I added. Shah said Russians
                            are paying some newspapers. He added that any unfriendliness of Iranian
                            opinion is at least part due to America's past mistakes. He cited what
                            he considers virtually public <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            support for Amini as “last chance for Iran,” and alleged <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> opposition to Iran's acquisition of
                            steel mill. He said he felt that this trend in public opinion would pass
                            within next few months, just as American press attitude toward his own
                            endeavors has undergone favorable change.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>Throughout discussion, Shah referred in bitter terms re U.S. policy
                            toward Nasser, and to India. Re latter, he reluctantly agreed that it
                            would be calamity for such sizeable nation to “go down drain.” Re
                            Nasser, I reiterated previous argumentation that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> policy is based not on reward for good behavior but on
                            what is in general interest of blocking communism and facilitating
                            Mideast stability. He remained unimpressed.</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>Shah complained how <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> treats its
                            friends as “commercial” clients. All my efforts to explain what
                            preferential treatment Iran has received in past and continues to
                            receive failed to change his mind.</item>
                        <label>17.</label>
                        <item>In summing up, Shah reiterated he wishes to proceed with purchase of:
                            remaining M–60 tanks, Blue Shark, and air force war reserve. He will
                            await further word re F–4's, particularly whether two squadrons
                            available and delivery prospects. Cost factor will also be taken into
                            consideration when comparing offers. He said he would like to make
                            foregoing purchases, but under clear understanding re his “liberty of
                            action” re procurement elsewhere if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            intends to attach “strings.” He said he would like to know now so that
                            alternative arrangements can be made now rather than two or three years
                            later when it may be too late. Shah closed by reassurance that whatever
                            happens to our military relationship his ideals are always those of U.S.
                            and free world.</item>

                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> called me in evening 2nd. He had
                        sheaf of notes substance of which emanated from Shah.</p>
                    <p>2. Main theme was that Shah wanted <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        continue supply “sensitive” equipment like aircraft. As for non-sensitive
                        material <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should show no concern if such
                        items purchased from Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>
                        indicated there was possibility Shah had already approached Russians, i.e.
                        in his talk with Semyon Skachkov, Chairman of Soviet State Committee for
                        External Economic Relations, who was in Tehran this past week signing formal
                        steel mill agreements. In any case, according to Shah via <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>, Americans should not react except
                        cheerfully.</p>
                    <p>3. Expressing concern, I told <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> Shah
                        should realize Americans are human also. There no question in my mind there
                        will be American reaction if Shah initiates any kind of military procurement
                        from Soviets. Americans will be particularly hurt because Americans have
                        considered Shah tried and true ally and friend.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> contended <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has not been sufficiently forthcoming. “For
                        seven months” (since passage of additional $200,000,000 credit authorization
                        by Parliament) Shah has waited, <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>
                        said, but only result is <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> insists on
                        treating Iran no better than ordinary commercial client.</p>
                    <p>5. Noting I was getting tired of this line, I said it is grossly unfair. Over
                        years US <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance has been tremendous.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> agreed, saying Shah deeply
                        appreciative. Despite what was presumably close military relationship, I
                        said, Shah sprang $200,000,000 credit gambit in Parliament without any hint
                        to us. We read about it in newspapers. I could assure <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> effect in Washington was not good.
                        Nevertheless, at Shah's prodding, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                        agreed provide additional credit.</p>
                    <p>6. It seems incredible to me, I said, that Shah fails appreciate extent of
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> military assistance still under way.
                        We had only two years ago agreed provide $200,000,000 credit for military
                        purchases, of which $60,000,000 still available at 4 percent. Recently
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agreed to additional $200,000,000 at
                        between 5 percent and 6 percent. Meanwhile, tens of millions of dollars
                        worth of grant material (including five squadrons of F–5 <pb n="267"
                            xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>aircraft) still undelivered, and tens of
                        millions of dollars are programmed as grant component for our supposed joint
                        program in years ahead. I said I could not comprehend Shah's jeopardizing
                        all these millions for a few dollars of ephemeral savings and a 2–1/2
                        percent interest rate.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> asked if I have explained all
                        this to Shah. I said these points been conveyed to Shah time and again but
                        he not in listening mood. Furthermore, when one gets explicit, Shah
                        immediately gets offended, makes accusation we threatening him, and is
                        propelled in opposite direction.</p>
                    <p>8. I went on to speculate that there is something more in all this than meets
                        the eye. (Comment. My hunch, not indicated to <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName>, is Shah wants to announce his abortive talks with
                        consortium moguls next week that as he warned his Western friends Iran is
                        shifting its trade pattern, including arms, to Eastern Bloc. This would turn
                        defeat of consortium summitry exercise into cheap political victory.)
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> insisted Shah is honest and
                        guileless friend of US with no ulterior motives.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> re-emphasized Shah wishes
                        purchase only non-sensitive relatively unimportant military wares from
                        Soviets. I alluded to incomprehensibility of Shah's hastiness. I said I
                        convinced adequate staff work not been done re purchases Shah proposing to
                        make. In our talk 29th, I noted, he completely disinterested in <gloss
                            target="#t_PGM1">PGM</gloss>'s Hawk Missiles, etc. They best equipment
                        available but apparently for political or other reasons, Shah eager to
                        purchase elsewhere what may turn out to be junk. With Russians, Shah
                        obviously doesn't even know what he wants to purchase, but is “hell-bent” to
                        purchase something probably for political reasons and also because he like
                        other Iranians is mesmerized by 2–1/2 percent interest rate, totally
                        disregarding other factors such as quality, value, etc. I added Shah's
                        military advisors tend to be sycophants who lack courage to question any
                        whim Shah may have.</p>
                    <p>10. Another point, I said, is that by introducing Russians into Iranian
                        military establishment Shah is inviting security problems for US. US
                        military survey team some months ago checked Iranian security effectiveness
                        and was able to give tentatively favorable report, thus permitting US to go
                        forward with program for Iran's acquisition of Hawks. Now Shah wants F–4
                        aircraft, one of most sophisticated pieces of equipment. It would not be
                        surprising to me if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would find it
                        impossible to supply such equipment if Russians in any way involved in
                        Iranian military establishment.</p>
                    <p>11. Another refrain we been hearing so frequently, I said, is that Iran is
                        “independent” and will tolerate no “strings.” (<persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> had earlier said Shah tends to feel <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> treats him like “lackey.“) I noted how
                        delighted U.S. is that Iran is standing on its own feet but added US is also
                        independent. Just as Shah is free to purchase from wheresoever he wishes,
                        including <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>Soviets, U.S. is also
                        free to determine when, how or where it will sell equipment, or even extend
                        grant aid. Question is not one, therefore, of strings. I added that Shah had
                        demonstrated his “independence” in steel mill deal and visits to East Bloc
                        countries. There appeared no urgent need to do so in something as risky as
                        military field.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> again urged that I have
                        another go at Shah. Reiterating Shah's quickness to take offense, I said he
                        would probably as he did 29th try to back us into corner to state
                        categorically whether F–5's will or will not be forthcoming if he turns to
                        Soviets. I assured <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> that while
                        some sort of reaction is sure neither I, nor President Johnson himself,
                        could in advance state precisely what nature of extent of American reaction
                        will be. Such things as security factors, Congressional reaction, as well as
                        Executive Branch determinations would all play a role.</p>
                    <p>13. Somewhat taken aback by this blunt talk, <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> said both he and I as diplomats would have to buckle
                        down to confine damage if Shah turns to Russians. I said that was both our
                        jobs. Nevertheless, even aside from direct repercussions on <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> military supply program in Iran, by opening
                        door to Soviets in military field Shah in every way stands to lose much more
                        than he can gain. I noted in this connection troubles <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> President Ayub is having in putting lid
                        back on Pandora's box.</p>
                    <p>14. In closing I urged <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> to seek to

                        dialogue to continue on matters of such vital consequence to this country. I
                        said I ready talk again with Shah or <persName corresp="#p_AA7"
                            >Aram</persName> any time they felt it would be useful.</p>

                        I discussed arms procurement situation morning 3rd. Covered most of same

                        context of providing <persName corresp="#p_AA11">Alam</persName> with
                        ammunition in his intimate discussions with Shah. Although considerably more
                        worried than heretofore, <persName corresp="#p_AA11">Alam</persName> retains
                        hope Shah can be dissuaded from involvement with Soviets in military
                        matters.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>Cy</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> informed the Shah of
                        Iran in late May of the U.S. proposal for an additional military credit
                        sales program to Iran of up to $200 million. The Shah left almost
                        immediately for state visits in Romania, Yugoslavia and Morocco. Since his
                        return to Tehran the Shah has conveyed to the Ambassador directly, and
                        through his aides, some serious misgivings about our offer. His
                        dissatisfaction stems from his almost obsessive concern for the security of
                        Iran's oil-rich province of Khuzistan and his conviction that equipment for
                        the defense of this vital area must be obtained in the shortest possible
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The Shah has mounted major pressure campaign to bring us around to his point
                        of view, using a number of high-level Iranians and the British Ambassador in
                        Tehran as channels of information as to what he might do if the United
                        States is not more responsive to his needs. This has been in addition to his
                        own personal contact with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName>. The principal spectre raised in this war of nerves
                        has been the possibility that Iran would buy arms from the Soviet Union, if
                        the United States could not offer Iran what it feels it needs at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, the bargaining element is very strong in this dialogue, which is
                        reminiscent of many exchanges with the Shah in the past. Times have changed,
                        however, and Iran is receiving large oil revenues and is experiencing steady
                        economic growth. The Shah, who more than any single individual is
                        responsible for this progress, is riding high. Al Friendly's article in the
                        Washington Post gives a balanced picture of the Shah's present strengths and
                        weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>With this as background the question arises, if we are to preserve our
                        special relationship with Iran, how far we need to go to meet the Shah's
                        demands. To accede completely is probably unnecessary, even if it were
                        possible from the point of view of the resources available to support a
                        military program in Iran. Nevertheless, the Shah has got himself committed
                        publicly to an independent arms procurement policy. It will be impossible
                        for him to retreat without some face-saving device. Should this be lacking,
                        I fear the Shah could easily take steps which would jeopardize our position
                        in Iran and which would be contrary to our national interest.</p>
                    <p>In the light of all this, we have concluded that present political hazards
                        are great enough to call for a little “give” in our military proposal. <pb
                            n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0298"/>The Embassy in Tehran has suggested
                        a number of possibilities, including the sale of rehabilitated F4C's at a
                        cost substantially lower than the F4D's now being offered the Iranians and
                        the waiver of <gloss target="#t_RD1">R &amp; D</gloss> costs in connection
                        with the new credit program. A third possibility, in line with the
                            <persName>Peterson</persName> Report proposal, might be increasing the
                        size from 12 to 16 of the F4D squadron now being offered.</p>
                    <p>I would very much appreciate your reaction to these suggestions and your own
                        judgment as to how we might best seek to keep our relationship with Iran on
                        an even keel.</p>

                        <item>In hour-long talk morning 7th, I told Shah that time had come for
                            frank conversation on arms procurement problem. Shah said he welcomed
                            opportunity and wanted make clear that steps he taking in no way
                            intended as “threats.” I said what I had to say should also be
                            considered in framework not of threats but facts.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I opened by expressing full <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            support for Iran's “independent” policy, emphasizing we delighted Iran
                            able stand on its own feet. Similarly, we can understand Iranian desire
                            in military field to get best buys and to diversify sources of supply.
                            We had been aware of Toufanian's shopping tours to Western Europe and
                            this gave us no serious concern. What was cause for concern, however,
                            would be turning to Soviets for arms. At least three times during
                            conversation I stated categorically that move to Soviets will inevitably
                            have serious “impact” as far as U.S. concerned, but added that precise
                            nature that impact uncertain.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Shah professed failure to comprehend why there should be any US
                            reaction. Contact has been made with Soviets, he affirmed, but
                            acquisitions <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0299"/>would be limited
                            in quantity and quality. I pointed out Americans are human and there not
                            slightest doubt they would be deeply hurt that valued and admired friend
                            like Shah has decided to trade in arms with our adversaries. This
                            particularly true, I added, at this time when whole American nation is
                            gripped by anxiety over Vietnam.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Shah said problem is one of basic economics. As he had publicly stated
                            in convocation of Deputies March 1, if oil income not stepped up to meet
                            Iran's requirements Iran would have no choice but to look to sources of
                            supply other than traditional suppliers. Problem was purely and simply
                            one of foreign exchange.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>On same occasion, Shah said, he had publicly stated his desire
                            maintain traditional sources of arms supplies if those sources would
                            offer acceptable terms. He had made same point in his personal appeals
                            to President Johnson. Meanwhile, he had “waited seven months” for US to
                            understand and respond sympathetically. R and D costs were being
                            assessed and in case of Hawk Missiles this alone represented $2,000,000.
                            I tried to explain that “accessorial charges” included number of
                            elements. Crowning blow, Shah said, was limiting Iran to one squadron of
                            12 F–4 aircraft. Clearly, Shah said, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            not interested in according Iran favorable treatment compatible with
                            investment US has put into this country or with traditional friendship
                            between our two countries.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>[garble—<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>?] deeply devoted to Iran's
                            higher interest, I said, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, unlike
                            certain other countries, not sending arms peddlers around even though we
                            have serious balance of payments problem. We abhor arms races and
                            overriding desire of President and others has been keep military
                            expenditures to minimum adequate level so that economic progress can go
                            forward. I went on to describe his assessment of our hardware response
                            as grossly unfair. Stressing framework of our 1962 and 1964 agreements,
                            I pointed out generous <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cooperation
                            over years which continues to this very moment. Despite surprise nature
                            of additional $200,000,000 authorization which Shah requested and
                            received from parliament, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had come
                            forward with offer of additional $200,000,000 credit. Military costs are
                            high these days, I said, and US equipment is best available. Prices had
                            been shaved as best we could. Noted in this connection Hawk Missile
                            battalion was offered at $28.8 million when earlier it had been $30, yet
                            Shah in our conversation week ago scarcely noticed Hawk item. Shah said
                            originally we had talked of $22 million price. I noted that was “naked”
                            Hawk battalion.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>
                            <p>Shah said total cost of items Iran required was over $400 million
                                according prices <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> offered. I said
                                on contrary I continue to have conviction we could work out
                                acceptable procurement program of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> purchased items, providing efficient and adequate
                                military security.</p>
                            <p>I went on to say that indicative of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss>'s general forthcomingness, there is today over
                                $200,000,000 worth grant assistance either undelivered <pb n="272"
                                    xml:id="pg_272" facs="0300"/>or contemplated over next three
                                year period. It difficult to understand, I said, how our Iranian
                                friends overlook something of such importance and appear ready to
                                jeopardize it. Noted in this connection difficulties in obtaining
                                grant funds to support such assistance from Congress.</p>
                        </item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Referring to inevitability of impact as far as <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> is concerned, Shah said if <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> held up on planned military supplies it would naturally
                            produce a chain reaction. Among other repercussions, Iran would procure
                            equipment elsewhere. Because of sensitivity of aircraft, he would not
                            consider MIGs. Shah said if F–4 aircraft unavailable he would buy
                            Mirages, adding that French are ready at any time to conclude
                            transaction including credit. When I recalled his aversion to single
                            engine aircraft Shah noted again that Israeli Air Force Chief of Staff

                        <item>Agreeing with Shah that chain reaction unfortunate, I asked why in
                            order to save a few dollars by purchases from East Bloc he so ready to
                            risk so much. Noted in this connection how Russians are duping so many
                            Mideast countries by handing out MIG–21s “like lollipops” and
                            mesmerizing Iranians and others with 2–1/2 percent interest rate. Shah
                            said problem was not so much savings as it was Iran's shortage of
                            foreign exchange, caused by lack of responsiveness of oil consortium. It
                            was because of this that Iran must turn to barter arrangements with
                            Soviets.</item>

                        <item>Shah said he knew we would lecture him re iniquities of dealing with
                            Soviets. No one knew them better than he, he said. He fully aware their
                            aims, including his own overthrow. I assured him we fully realize
                            Iranians have had more firsthand experience this subject than even we.
                            Shah said we should realize that by getting Soviets to contribute to
                            Iran's strength, he was in fact improving Iran's capability of resisting
                            Commie penetration.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>This prompted discussion of implications of Commie involvement in
                            Iranian military establishment as far as US security considerations
                            concerned, vis-à-vis Hawk, Sidewinders and F–4's. Shah tried argue
                            security penetration capability of Soviets would not be significantly
                            increased, but this point seemed at least make slight dent. When he
                            emphasized Soviet involvement would be carefully circumscribed, I told
                            him it is difficult “to be little bit pregnant.”</item>

                            supplies last fall. I reiterated previous arguments. Shah agreed Paks
                            had fomented conflict. He also reluctantly agreed that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy of stopping hostilities was
                            wiser than fueling them with more arms. Noting that Arabs were his
                            rivals, I questioned his depending on Soviets if Iran-Arab conflict were
                            to arise. Shah said he aware this point and would lay in adequate spare
                            parts, etc. in advance.</item>

                                >SAM</gloss>s. When I suggested their inferiority to Hawks, noting
                            morning's news that US planes in Vietnam undertook all missions
                            successfully yesterday despite <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s,

                            available. He was very critical of what he contended is $500,000 per
                            copy price for Sheridans, noting again he being assessed R and D costs.
                            Shah did not contest strongly when I pointed out M–47's still useful and
                            question of Sheridans deferrable at least until 1970.</item>

                        <item>Even more disturbing than “impact” on U.S.-Iran military relationship,
                            I said, is general effect turning to Russians will have on Shah's image
                            and confidence in Iran. I pointed our Western world considers him
                            enlightened, progressive and responsible leader. Some people would
                            inevitably feel he now becoming another De Gaulle or even Nasser. Noted
                            sad shape of other countries who started down arms procurement path with
                            Soviets, i.e. Egypt (whose move to buy Soviet arms came under
                            circumstances not entirely dissimilar from Shah's complaints), Ghana,
                            Indonesia, and even Afghanistan. Shah promptly cited India. When asked
                            whether he envied India's plight, Shah said no, but contended that Iran
                            is much more responsibly and intelligently led than all those countries.
                            I emphasized Iran is doing very well indeed and that is precisely reason
                            we hate see policies which have produced its prosperity put in jeopardy.
                            Shah insisted policy of procuring arms even from Soviets would be fully
                            supported throughout Iran. I said undoubtedly it would be popular with
                            street elements but I would have thought he might have learned from
                            Ayub's present troubles difficulty of putting lid back on Pandora's Box.
                            Shah said all Iranians, not just street, would be content.</item>

                            movement in Iran. Very thought, I said, is ridiculous. Nevertheless,
                            Shah went on to point out what we would lose if he were to lose his
                            throne. Comment. Obsession of this type is incomprehensible to us, but
                            it is in Shah's full character.</item>

                        <item>At one point Shah plaintively expressed wish for opportunity to have
                            two or three days to talk out his problems with President Johnson. He
                            said he very much shares President Johnson's concern for preserving
                            Iran's economic progress. He reemphasized problem is primarily one of
                            foreign exchange. It was because of this serious problem that he had
                            hoped <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could find it possible to
                            accord Iran reasonable prices and terms as it had with M–60 tanks.

                            leadership, I noted that during my half hour talk with President this
                            came through as did President's personal concern that military
                            expenditures be minimal within framework of adequate security.</item>

                            to go into “details.” Before departure, I referred to this and urged

                                    programs; there is no doubt that Iran's entering into a military

                                    would produce a negative reaction in the US which would

                        <item>Re point B, Shah obviously gratified by prospect of two F–4 squadrons
                            being considered for Iran, as well as earlier delivery date. I noted
                            phrase “within available credit” signifies Washington's uninterrupted
                            desire that military expenditures be kept in perspective.</item>

                        <item>Point C opened up whole subject of proposed dealing with Soviets.
                            Disinterest in Hawks, Shah said, is due to fact Iran has approached
                            Soviets for anti-aircraft guns and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s.
                            I showed him clipping from July 8 <hi rend="italic">

                            capability of Hawks (during days when Israelis first sought them from
                            us), I pointed out superiority this weapon: a) entirely different from
                                Nike-Bloodhound-<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> flashlight ray
                            types; b) radar much more sophisticated; c) catches aircraft at low
                            altitudes, which is what Shah has to fear, as over against <gloss
                                target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s which are not good at low levels; and
                            d) enemy aircraft have more difficulty dodging Hawks than <gloss

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Shah showed lively interest in these arguments but countered; a) it's
                            too late; Iran has already approached Soviets and to reject Soviets
                            without hearing them out would be impossible demonstration of his being
                            “U.S. puppet”; and b) it is all question of money; Hawks are too
                            expensive to shoe-horn into available U.S. credit. Re latter point, I
                            said it remains to be seen what we can finally shoe-horn into joint
                            program we had envisaged. Re Soviets, I expressed assumption Iranians
                            would do better staff work than obviously been done to date and
                            decisions re military equipment would be influenced by quality of
                            product as well as low pricing and political considerations. I suggested
                            that inferiority of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s might well
                            prove to be loophole from which to get out of transaction with Soviets.
                            While Shah gave no indication, my impression is that this thought was
                            tucked away in his mind for potential but not probable use.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Re point D, Shah still attracted to four British Vospers, hover-craft
                            and battle-class destroyer (which while not new will be adequate for
                            time being, he said, particularly as trainer. He likes idea of 1,100 ton
                            Vosper “pocket destroyers” with their 40 knot speed and electronic guns.
                            (He confided in strict confidence Vospers would be equipped with surface
                            to surface missiles to be acquired from a small non-Commie country.)
                            Shah said <gloss target="#t_PGM1">PGM</gloss>'s are lighter craft, but I
                            stressed earlier delivery date possible than for British vessels which
                            still largely gleam in designer's eye. Shah said destroyer is not
                            essential to British sales package; any or all items available in
                            accordance Shah's wishes. Cost of Vosper is 4,000,000 pounds per copy.
                            Once again I urged Shah to assure complete staff work had been
                            accomplished before rushing headlong into a transaction. Throughout
                            discussion I [garble] clear that some well-conceived diversification of
                            his supply sources provided they not Communist is not
                            objectionable.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Shah smarted somewhat over assertion in point E that furnishing of
                            military assistance is a choice just as sovereign for US as is
                            procurement for Iran. He himself began adding up figures and found
                            something like $460,000,000 in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> grant
                            and credit is at stake. He suggested this is something we should think
                            about (meaning gravity of chain reaction), but quickly drew obvious
                            point it is even more important for Iranians to think about. I of
                            course, once again emphasized how incredible it is that Shah would
                            jeopardize so much for so little gain. Changing supply pattern in itself
                            would be costly business. Nonetheless, Shah undauntedly professed
                            confidence Iran would one way or another be able fulfill its military
                            needs if complete break in US-Iran military relationship occurs.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Re point F, Shah with considerable conviction expressed view Congress
                            could be persuaded to see wisdom of his purchasing some arms from
                            Soviets. He argued: a) by contributing to Iran's security strength,
                            Soviets will in fact be contributing to Iran's ability to resist
                            Communist endeavors against Iran. I said obviously Soviets have other
                                <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0306"/>purposes of which we only
                            too well aware. His second argument: b) Soviets are building up image as
                            being [garble] and peaceful nation whose only interest is to build up
                            Iran's economic strength as by steel mill. Last evening he had heard
                            clandestine broadcast emphasizing this theme. Wouldn't it be more
                            intelligent, he asked, to tarnish Soviet image by diverting to them
                            allegations presently being made against Americans to effect our only
                            interest is monetary profits via peddling of arms? I said latter thought
                            had occurred to us. “Intellectual critics” of Shah's regime (whom Shah
                            loathes) have for long time condemned <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>'s over-identification with Shah in military field. I
                            said I did not believe day would come when Shah would concur with those
                            critics. He quickly added that such criticism exists in Washington as
                            well as Iran.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I went on to say that popular opinion does not usually charge Soviets
                            with same criticism it employs against U.S. Fact is most Iranians would
                            be impressed and quite a few dismayed by what is becoming virtual
                            stampede in direction of Soviet Bloc, e.g. steel mill, barter
                            agreements, <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>'s visits to five Commie
                            countries, etc. My own impression is Soviets and many Iranians would
                            consider this as sign of weakness on Shah's part, particularly if pell
                            mell rush to Soviets is now topped off with arms deal. I pointed out
                            what a triumph all this would represent for Soviet policy in Iran and in
                            Middle East. Shah said it was <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s
                            fault e.g. high prices, R and D costs, etc. Once again I reviewed what

                        <item>Although acknowledging there many different circumstances particularly
                            in economic field, I drew parallel of “red prince” Badr in Yemen. He too
                            had been impatient with West, had gone to Moscow, been wined and dined,
                            and delightedly embarked on arms procurement road with Soviets. Months
                            later, when he was murdered by recipients those arms, Soviets shed no
                            tears but cynically and quickly recognized his successors. Shah opined
                            that Soviets had also worked through Nasser, but then went off on
                            tangent re American recognition of Sallal regime. Shah made clear he
                            intends to purchase five years' supply of spare parts for equipment
                            acquired from Soviets.</item>

                        <item>Shah contended by proper instruction American people could be
                            persuaded of wisdom his buying non-sensitive arms from Soviets. I said
                            this simply not realistic. On contrary, fact that he has been such an
                            admired and responsible friend likely cause added bitterness of jilted
                            lover. Emphasized, as in point F, impossible predict future of

                        <item>Referring to Al Friendly articles, I said Shah has always had good
                            image in U.S. and particularly recently. This highly gratifying. I said
                            it incomprehensible why he wishes tarnish this image in such dramatic
                            fashion. I quoted Shakespeare re money being trash but good name is
                            all-important.</item>

                        <item>When making point re security complications (noted in point F), Shah
                            insisted Soviets would be kept in check. There would be no Iranians
                            trained in Soviet Union and Soviet technicians training in anti-aircraft
                            usage would be kept apart and returned as soon as possible. Again, I
                            said, Shah is being unrealistic. In any case, there no question in
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> minds that opportunities for
                            Soviet penetration and subversion would multiply and would effect our
                            willingness supply equipment. Shah said <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> seeking “excuses.” I pointed out India and Iraq are
                            examples where US furnishing no sophisticated arms.</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>Shah said he wants proceed with procurement those items he ready
                            purchase from U.S. He wondered re next move, e.g. letter from Minister
                            of Court to us. I said it not possible make such move until total
                            picture is clear. For example, how could we make an agreement without
                            knowing whether Iran will order Hawks. Shah said he would in any case
                            require three battalions and that would eat up too big a chunk of
                            available credit. He simply wants order from U.S. those items which he
                            clearly wants. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> unwilling sell
                            F–4's Shah said, he will turn to French Mirages, and there is, he added,
                            some urgency re this matter. I reminded him that when prior to his
                            departure we expressed readiness to provide additional $200,000,000
                            credit it was made clear that if substantial purchases made elsewhere
                            this would reduce total available from <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>. It was obviously time to make this point again for
                            Shah was visibly shaken by it.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>Shah went into inequities of “strings” and “taking orders.” He
                            referred to our “puppets” elsewhere which he did not care to emulate. I
                            asked him to name one. He couldn't. I said even General Ky in whose
                            country <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is investing $20,000,000,000
                            is, sometimes to our pain, his own boss. Human beings everywhere,
                            including Americans, have same instincts as wish of wanting be
                            “independent.” There is no attempt, I said, for <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> to give Shah “orders.” There is, however a great
                            challenge to both our countries to translate former aid-dependent
                            relationship into something normal, natural, constructive and durable. I
                            said I was sure this was his intention, even as it ours, but it is
                            something that must be done gradually and may not survive drastic move
                            as his turning to north. Irritated by phrase “turning to north,” Shah
                            reiterated his old line that over these past months <gloss

                            his appeals including indications that he would, if necessary and as
                            much as he disliked it, increase trade, including initiation of some
                            arms procurement, from East Bloc if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            and oil companies persisted in their disinterestedness.</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>Throughout conversation I stressed to Shah importance of his
                            maintaining his maneuverability. This is true in his handling of opinion
                            in Iran, I indicated, (having in mind his forthcoming session with
                            Parliament members). Shah said he is refraining from airing details of
                            issue between <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0308"/>our two

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. There is no longer question Shah has
                            approached Soviets for Ack Ack guns and <gloss target="#t_SAM1"
                                >SAM</gloss>s. He indicated several times curiosity re what Soviet
                            response will be, even manifesting a little impatience over failure of
                            Soviets to reply in past ten days or fortnight. He thought it might be
                            their preoccupation with Warsaw Pact. Questions now are whether Shah can
                            be persuaded to extricate himself from joint business (using technical
                            loopholes) with Soviets, and if not how to shape our own response
                            considering among other factors undesirability pushing him further into
                            Soviet embrace.</item>

                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KK1">Khosrovani</persName> began by stressing
                        Iranian friendship for US, hope that close relationship would continue and
                        gratitude for past and present US aid. He said he instructed explain that
                        momentum of development and reform programs must be sustained while at same
                        time defense program requires attention in light Egyptian trouble-making in
                        Persian Gulf. If US not able assist as much as before, Iran hopes it will
                        understand if Iran procures what it needs at cheaper prices from elsewhere.
                        Iranian military cooperation with US will be maintained and there should be
                        no US apprehension.</p>
                    <p>3. Secretary replied he familiar with talks Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> has had on this subject with Shah and
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>. He said we have always held
                        Shah in highest esteem and continue do so. Under his leadership Iran has <pb
                            n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>never been more stable, secure and
                        progressive. We have greatly valued relationship and hope it will continue.
                        We understand what we have offered may not be as much as Shah wants, but it
                        very large in light US fighting war and other burdens on U.S. taxpayer.</p>
                    <p>4. Secretary said Iran is of course as sovereign as U.S., but we are
                        concerned about path on which Shah may be embarking because we do not see
                        where it will lead. If there is trouble in area, it comes from <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> through its provision of arms to <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iraq and its encouragement of
                        trouble-making. Secretary said it difficult understand what Iranian arms
                        purchases from Soviets will mean for Iran or for U.S.S.R. Soviet attitude to
                        Iran well known, and <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> himself has
                        in past commented on his concern about “friendly Soviet subversion.” It not
                        surprising Soviets might want sell arms cheaply, for example <gloss
                            target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s after their experience with them in Viet
                        Nam. Of over 300 fired in Viet Nam only 14 on target, and head of Soviet
                        missile program is in Viet Nam to see what is wrong.</p>
                    <p>5. Secretary added it difficult perceive longer-term effects on US-Iranian
                        relations of contemplated Iranian steps. Since 1946 we have given strong
                        support to independence and security of Iran. We don't know what Congress
                        and American public will think about Iran's turning for arms to the
                        principal source of trouble in area. This not something which executive
                        branch alone can control. Hence reaction cannot be predicted, but we hope
                        our relations will remain intimate as they have been of mutual benefit for
                        past twenty years. In short, we concerned about future.</p>
                    <p>6. Secretary also pointed out we might have serious security problems if
                        Iranian purchases from Soviets expose our sensitive equipment such as F–4's
                        to penetration.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KK1">Khosrovani</persName> responded by saying
                        admittedly <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a threat, but immediate
                        danger comes from elsewhere. He said Iran feels need as independent nation
                        be able defend itself and stronger Iran will be better friend of US. He
                        twice expressed hope we would make clearer in Tehran what it is we are
                        prepared to offer, saying that Iran must make best use of its limited
                        financial resources.</p>
                    <p>8. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> mentioned that we
                        have been pursuing in Tehran question of program for our available credit
                        and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> has told
                        Shah we are considering second F–4 squadron.</p>
                    <p>9. Secretary said if there are problems about amounts of money and delivery
                        dates this is because we are demonstrating in Viet Nam, by among other
                        things spending extra billion dollars per month, that friendship of US is
                        important to security of our friends. Most important security asset Iran has
                        is friendship of US.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KK1">Khosrovani</persName>, saying he speaking
                        personally, commented that there is a psychological factor involved in that
                        at certain stage of development countries feel they should have independent
                        means of defense.</p>
                    <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0310"/>
                    <p>11. Secretary responded Iran's armed forces are for defense of Iran and
                        Iran's policy is independent but repeated we do not understand what it means
                        for Iran to turn for arms to the source of trouble in the area.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_KK1">Khosrovani</persName> asked if this would not
                        neutralize Soviet policy, to which Secretary replied it works other way too
                        and Soviets may want have important influence on Iranian policy. Replying US

                    <p>Over the years I have gradually developed an increasing appreciation for what
                        Iran does in the world. The Shah has worked closely with Israel. Iran is the
                        only country in the Middle East contributing directly to South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Recently I met the Shah's brother socially, as well as several other well
                        informed friends of Iran. Their story is always the same: Please tell the
                        President that unless something happens to change his mind, the <pb n="283"
                            xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>Shah is going to buy a package of Soviet
                        arms on the relatively easy credit they dangle in front of him.</p>
                    <p>Our executive departments are struggling to come up with the right answer;
                        since April they have wrestled each other without decision.</p>
                    <p>I know how overcrowded your calendar is and I would only suggest adding to it
                        for the most important reasons.</p>
                    <p>In the present circumstances I feel it would be wonderful if you would invite
                        the Shah to come talk to you. He wants to hear from you personally what a
                        grand guy he is, and how much you love him. He wants to tell you his fears
                        and he needs to be reassured by you. Only the President, himself, can
                        persuade the Shah against taking the step he is now contemplating.</p>

                                of the Soviet missiles. He feels this will thoroughly demonstrate
                                that the Soviet missile is a third rate product which will be
                                increasingly obsolete in the next couple of years, especially as the
                                countermeasures to it will become as widespread as the missile
                                itself.</item>

                                    declassified</hi>]—though they have sympathized with the Shah's
                                viewpoint for many years—agrees that he is doing the right thing
                                now. First, he will set off a train of events here in Washington
                                where everyone is preoccupied with Vietnam <pb n="284"
                                    xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>that no one can see the end of. If
                                he can just be patient, Washington is increasingly aware of the
                                Shah's legitimate interest in the Persian Gulf and is working its
                                way to encouraging him to take a larger role there. On the Middle
                                Eastern theme, with recent developments in Iraq, the gap between the
                                Shah and his potential adversaries is narrowing. Moving to the
                                Soviet Union now would just undermine this very hopeful
                                trend.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Critchfield reiterated his feeling that the chief ingredient of this problem
                        is the Shah's sense of being cut off from the President. The Shah believes
                        that the letters the President sends him are drafted in the State Department
                        and, therefore, he has had no direct communication with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> since the President took
                        office.</p>
                    <p>Critchfield says he argued with <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill
                            Moyers</persName> and others in the White House discreetly that during
                        the Shah's recent trip we should invite him to fly over from Morocco for a
                        few hours to see the President. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1"
                            >Moyers</persName> and others felt the President should not be involved,
                        so we missed that opportunity for a quiet morale boosting exercise which
                        would have stopped this whole Soviet ploy in its tracks.</p>
                    <p>I commended Critchfield for the private approach he is planning to have made.
                        I told him what we had in mind to proliferate the impression that Washington
                        is deeply disturbed by the Shah's move. Critchfield feels we missed a golden
                        opportunity to have the Shah here back in June but is not sure that now, in
                        the wake of Brady's article, we could do this. He promised to keep us
                        posted.</p>

                    <p>We are down to the wire in our arms negotiations with the Shah. He still
                        feels that the $200 million package we offered does not include all the air
                        defense he needs; and he has approached the U.S.S.R. for surface-to-air
                        missiles and anti-aircraft guns. We included both our Hawk missile and some
                        AA guns in our package, but Soviet prices are lower.</p>
                    <p>Part of the Shah's move is traditional Persian bargaining. But there are
                        other elements: <list>
                            <item>—He feels neglected and taken for granted; and he rightly sees
                                these negotiations as a way to gain attention.</item>
                            <item>—He genuinely fears that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                and Iraq have designs on his oil-producing southern provinces. Our
                                cutting off Ayub's military aid last fall left him suspicious that
                                we would do the same to him in a fight with local non-Communist
                                enemies.</item>
                            <item>—He sees short-run domestic political advantage in showing he is
                                not a U.S. puppet.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>We are trying through both formal and informal channels to dissuade him from
                        buying Soviet equipment. If he wishes to diversify his sources of hardware,
                        Western Europe would make more sense and be acceptable to us.</p>
                    <p>Defense says security would prevent our selling advanced equipment if Soviet
                        technicians come to Iran.</p>
                    <p>Congress would also give us a hard time if another ally turns to Communist
                        arms supply, although the problem arises in good part because military aid
                        funds are too low.</p>
                    <p>Most important, while the Shah's reform program is going well, Iran is far
                        from out of the woods politically. We wish to avoid his inviting the Soviets
                        into Iran to meddle in what may still be a turbulent process of
                        evolution.</p>
                    <p>On balance, we would rather not see the Shah buy equipment on the scale he
                        contemplates. Though oil revenues are good, we fear he is overreaching his
                        ability to repay in the years ahead without cutting into development. We
                        have set up an annual joint review to keep the military-economic balance
                        firmly before the Shah.</p>
                    <p>But the fact is that he believes the Arab threat is urgent; and he believes
                        security comes first. With the British pulling out of South Arabia <pb
                            n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0314"/>and retrenching in the Persian
                        Gulf, I'm not sure he isn't right. He is dead earnest when he says he will
                        buy this hardware somewhere if we refuse to sell it. Soviet equipment is the
                        cheapest, though Soviet missiles are poor in quality, at least when manned
                        by North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>Our choices now are to: <list>
                            <item>—Tell him that we have gone the limit and that if he buys Soviet
                                hardware he will jeopardize our continued military aid. Chances are
                                that he would go ahead anyway if only to underline his independence,
                                and we would have to make up our minds to adjust to an increasingly
                                neutralist Iran.</item>
                            <item>—Offer one more concession in substituting 32 rehabilitated F–4C
                                aircraft for the 12 new F–4D's in our initial offer. Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> could take
                                these out of our inventory in late 1968 and pass them on at
                                second-hand prices, so the cost to us would be the difference
                                between that price and our cost of replacing those planes with newer
                                models for our own inventory.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>I share the judgment of Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                            >Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        that we should make this final offer.</p>
                    <p>We would still try to keep the Shah within the total credit ceiling you
                        approved, but we would have to absorb about $30 million in additional costs
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> via our <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1967 supplemental. This would round out our effort to meet
                        his most legitimate air defense and other needs at good prices.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> also recommends you send
                        the Shah a letter.</p>
                    <p>I have thus far resisted involving you directly in the bargaining which has
                        been going on. But now that we are about to make our final move, I think a
                        letter is a good idea. Part of our trouble is the Shah's familiar feeling
                        that he is cut off from you. This letter would show that you fully
                        understand his real worries and have personally tried—within the limits of
                        your problems—to accommodate him.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                    <p>I have followed closely Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName>'s reports of his recent conversations with you. He has
                        told me of your concern over Iran's defense requirements, and I want to
                        share with you my own views on the developing situation before us. Candor
                        between friends is essential to mutual understanding and my views are
                        offered in that vein.</p>
                    <p>The total relationship between the United States and Iran, and particularly
                        our cooperation in military matters, has been cordial and it has met the
                        interests of both our countries. The U.S. for its part sincerely hopes that
                        circumstances will permit this to continue in full effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>For we share a common view of certain basic problems. Thus we both understand
                        that, while the immediate threat of Soviet military aggression has receded,
                        indirect pressures continue and the Soviet aim of communizing Iran remains
                        the same. I know clandestine radio broadcasts remind you daily of this
                        long-range threat. You have shown your understanding of Communist aims by
                        sending an Iranian team to Vietnam, and I am strengthened by this
                        demonstration of your faith in our purpose there.</p>
                    <p>We also share the realization that the Middle East is undergoing rapid
                        change. The unfolding situation, particularly in the areas south of Iran,
                        demands our close watchfulness, as it embodies both potential opportunity
                        and potential danger. At a time when the United States is heavily engaged in
                        the defense of freedom in Asia, we are no less interested in continued
                        stability in the Persian Gulf area. We welcome your determination to help
                        maintain that stability. As responsible leaders, we share the awareness that
                        our task is to make inevitable change as orderly and constructive as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>It was thus against a background of continuing comradeship between our two
                        nations in facing together a complex and dangerous international environment
                        and of concern for Iran's security that we have offered an additional $200
                        million credit for the purchase of military equipment. We have been seeking
                        by all means to develop fair and reasonable terms. We are also urgently
                        working further on the particular questions of price and delivery dates for
                        two squadrons of F–4 aircraft.</p>
                    <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"/>
                    <p>Our resources are, of course, burdened by the defense of free world interests
                        in Vietnam. And they are limited, for military assistance purposes, by the
                        Congress. Nevertheless, it remains our intent to respond to your security
                        needs; and I believe we have done so.</p>
                    <p>You should have no doubt of our desire to help Iran. But you should also
                        understand that if Iran were to enter into an arms arrangement with the
                        Soviet Union or with other Communist countries, this would confront us with
                        serious problems in carrying forward our military assist-ance.</p>
                    <p>While you may see short-term advantages to such a step, I see major long-term
                        disadvantage, both political and technical.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, I cannot believe that any of us will profit by the Soviets'
                            coming any closer to the Persian Gulf than they already are. I would not
                            guess that they regard it as in their interest that the stability of
                            this area be increased.</item>
                        <item>Second, it would confuse our Congress and our people concerning Iran's
                            intentions. I cannot predict precisely what the reaction here would be;
                            but it would certainly be unfavorable to the interests which we share in
                            strengthening Iran's defenses.</item>
                        <item>Third, on the technical side, I am certain you can appreciate our
                            intent to protect sensitive American equipment from compromise by Soviet
                            military technicians.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Our purpose in aiding Iran has been to preserve and strengthen your country's
                        independence. We are proud to have contributed to the gathering political
                        and economic strength of Iran under your wise and skillful leadership. If
                        Iran should turn to the Communist nations for arms, we will not be so
                        shortsighted as to turn from our close relationship. But I do fear the
                        impairment of our military assistance program.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I hope that you will look only to Free World sources of arms in
                        meeting your security requirements.</p>
                    <p>You will, of course, weigh this matter in the light of Iran's basic interests
                        as you see them. I did, however, want you to receive my views personally and
                        with the complete candor our partnership requires and deserves.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to going more deeply into this and other problems of common
                        concern when it becomes possible for us to meet. I will also very much want
                        to hear directly from you more about the heartening economic and social
                        progress Iran has made under your skillful leadership. Unfortunately, with
                        our coming elections, I doubt we can manage to get together in the next
                        several months. Perhaps early in the new year we could find a mutually
                        agreeable time for direct discussion. In the meantime, <pb n="289"
                            xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>I wanted to share with you now—in the
                        spirit of the partnership I feel—the problems which might arise.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                                maneuverable as they should be, and he doesn't want the Shah to have
                                them because this fact would then become widely known.</item>

                            <item>He does not want to decide now whether and at what pace he wants

                                not be coming up for six weeks to two months. (These reasons have

                        <item>Almost resignedly, Shah said everything depends on Russians. It was
                            Iran which took initiative and it simply not possible for Iran call off

                        <item>Shah said he first to recognize Russians “are my enemies.” At same
                            time, in his opinion <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot
                            “reproach” him for what he did. He reiterated usual line about waiting
                            many months for American responsiveness but, while he appreciated
                            $200,000,000 credit, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prices were
                            high, terms were harder than they should be, and delivery dates were far
                            off. Particularly indicative of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> lack
                            of sympathy, he said, was limiting sale of F–4 aircraft to 12 (which
                            would mean 3 per airfield). This reflected persistent Washington
                            disposition to make decisions which Shah feels are within his

                            including conditions, are of secondary importance. Shah agreed with that
                            assessment, but opined that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> seems

                        <item>While recognizing that Shah may have gotten himself “in a box” with
                            Russians, I expressed confidence he could extricate himself if he truly
                            wished. Expressing assumption he “free man,” I said I did not see why
                            just because he had approached Russians he required effect purchases,
                            particularly since it possible to demonstrate that most of Russian
                            equipment could be refused on quality grounds, e.g., <gloss

                            obligation” but it also clear he is so psychologically. I questioned
                            economics of buying “cheap” <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s with 5
                            percent efficiency when Hawks, though more expensive, have many times

                            additional info, e.g. <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s been

                            control; and that <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> ineffectiveness in
                            Viet-Nam is despite fact they manned by Russians. Shah said <gloss

                        <item>Of parenthetical interest, Shah said <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                >Pak</gloss> mission to Moscow at first ran into Soviet jibes re

                            truly remarkable mobile radar, etc. Asked if transaction concluded, Shah
                            said no it is under <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> study. He
                            implied Paks are worried about effect on their improving relations with

                            completely “free of charge” (he agreed it is obviously for ulterior

                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Asked what specifically Iranians have asked of Russians, Shah said
                            anti-aircraft guns, <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s and “other
                            things” not coverable via <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> or British
                            credit. Reluctantly he indicated tanks cannot be excluded. He said plans
                            must be made for replacing M–47's. He had hoped for Sheridans.
                            Reiterating no response yet received from Soviets, Shah said only clue
                            was Soviet Military Attache recently asked an Iranian officer why Iran
                            not interested in Soviet aircraft. Shah again assured that under no
                            circumstances will he purchase MIG's.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Shah insisted he will tolerate no Soviet “conditions,” e.g., ouster of
                                ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, withdrawal from <gloss
                                target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, or even stationing of Soviet
                            technicians in Iran. Under interrogation, however, he appeared less sure
                            that he could hold the line at just “some training of few students.” To
                            illustrate his firmness re “conditions” Shah said Soviet Ambassador when
                            Shah was in Europe called on For Ministry UnderSec Qarib, and referring
                            to <hi rend="italic">NYTimes</hi> article, protested <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> strategic installations in northern
                            Iran. Shah said he sent word back to tell Soviet Ambassador to “mind his
                            own business.” Shah noted that in 1962 Iran had promised Soviets not to
                            have foreign missile bases and Soviet Ambassador was told that no
                            interference in Iran's internal affairs would be brooked from any
                            quarter. (Comment: This is first time Shah has referred to subject of
                            our installations in any conversation on arms sales.)</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Shah was greatly impressed by two phrases in President's letter, i.e.
                            U.S. “will not be so shortsighted as to turn from our close
                            relationship”. And President's fear that our “military assistance
                            program” will be impaired. Shah bemoaned why would <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> undertake “strong reaction” which would
                            so clearly serve Soviet aim. Noting that it was not <pb n="293"
                                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0321"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> which has produced present
                            situation, I said President in his letter gave three clear reasons why
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> reaction inevitable. Even if
                            Executive Branch were not involved, American people and Congress are.
                            Moreover, potential compromise of highly classified equipment should
                            certainly be understood by him. Observing that Soviets not bothered by
                            such things as “this Congress business,” Shah again said <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> can always find “excuses.” I said
                            sharply this not question of “excuses.” Then went into lengthy
                            explanation of how <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not want its
                            Hawks, Blue Shark and F–4's compromised after example of Soviet <gloss

                                >Dated July 20. (Ibid., DEF 19–8 U.S.-IRAN)</note> I noted how
                            difficult it would be to shield Soviet technicians from Blue Shark
                            control, etc. Shah said he suspects Soviets already know much re U.S.

                            by keeping Soviet technicians within walled compound way out in

                        <item>Shaken but seemingly undaunted by Presidential declaration that U.S.
                            military program here will be adversely affected, Shah reiterated his
                            earnest desire that U.S.-Iran military relationship not be disrupted. He
                            added, however, that if that came to pass, Iran would be able fill void
                            from other sources. I reiterated that as long as Iran arms procurement
                            is from non-Communist sources, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does
                            not object. Except for Soviet procurement, I agreed with Shah that there
                            may even be advantage in diversification as a principle in order for
                            Iran to have a more independent image.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>Shah contended that while he turned to Soviets only because of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s insufficient responsiveness, there
                            may even be one or two good points favoring the move. For one thing, it
                            would demonstrate to the people of Iran that Soviets are arms peddlers
                            (a criticism heretofore reserved only for Americans) as well as peaceful
                            steel mill providers. Secondly, Shah said that by his dealing with
                            Soviets it may help “break Soviet offensive in building up a bloc of
                            so-called progressive states” in Mideast.</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>This provided occasion expound my theory that Soviet motives are
                            diabolical. Soviets have no qualms about fueling regional conflicts, I
                            said, probably realizing that as with Pak-India conflict last fall those
                            conflicts will run out of gas in couple of weeks and both sides welcome
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> truce order. Meanwhile, Soviets
                            pour arms into countries friendly to them to assure their friendship.
                            Shah himself interjected that in process they wean America's friends and
                            make them ripe for Soviet blandishments. Shah added that behind these
                            moves Soviets are desperately trying shore up waning fortunes of
                            Socialist-Communist system which is failing wherever it exists and which
                            is doomed unless Soviets can divert attention from its failures. He
                            cited Syria as product of these Soviet endeavors. <pb n="294"
                                xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>I said this was precisely my main
                            point, i.e., by loading up Mideast countries with arms Soviets can keep
                            them weak and dependent. I said Soviet propaganda re “progressive”
                            Mideast states, i.e., Syria, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and
                            Egypt, is hollow as long as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and even
                            “unviable” Jordan are doing so much better than “progressives.”
                            Obviously, I said, Soviets want to reduce all Mideast states to be
                            Syrias. Shah agreed, but, of course, insisted that Iran has no choice
                            but to build up adequate defense, as even <persName>Peterson</persName>
                            mission, he added, had determined is necessary. Saying he doubted <gloss

                            situations at once, Shah said he continues to believe it is in <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest to have Iran adequately
                            equipped to deter or cope with regional threat in Persian Gulf

                            Shah and he could talk things out. Shah showed gratification at this
                            point but at same time made clear that his decisions re military
                            procurement cannot wait until early next year.</item>

                            for two squadrons of 16 each. He himself had figured on basis one

                            circa $100 million. He considered this cost high but he might
                            conceivably pay this sum: a) because he knows F–4 is best of its kind;
                            and b) he and General Khatemi want keep air force in US hands. As to
                            delivery, Shah's target date for completion of defense build-up is 1968,

                            other equipment; d) expeditious schedule of deliveries; and e) ultimate

                            accordingly. By making such a move, with attractive F–4 proposition at

                            Soviets; c) thwart Soviet efforts for ousting our facilities and other

                    <p>I first expressed Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s regret for not being able
                        to meet with the Ambassador, but that he had unexpectedly been called
                        upstairs by the President before a Cabinet meeting that was to follow about
                        12:15. I suggested we have our discussion, and then if Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> returned, he could carry on.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Iran is America's closest friend in the Middle East; it is the
                                only one which has stood with us on behalf of our policy in Vietnam.
                                The Shah argued for three days in Bucharest in order to water down a
                                sharp Rumanian communique. We have stood side by side in the
                                anti-Communist struggle.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>However, Iran has found that the direction of the threat to Iran
                                has been changing somewhat over the past two or three years, as
                                Soviet policy toward Iran has become more civil while Soviet
                                military support for the Arab countries has radically increased.
                                This has happened at a time when British power is withdrawing from
                                the area, particularly the Persian Gulf. The Shah believes that
                                America's reaction to this changed situation has not been as
                                responsive as the threat from the Arab countries has
                                required.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>While he has great respect for our military experience and the
                                competence of our military specialists, the long discussions
                                preceding each decision on military support have sometimes appeared
                                like foot-dragging and have often been humiliating as foreign
                                advisors tell him that they know better what he needs than he does—a
                                contention the Shah is unwilling to accept.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>With the U.S. switch from grant assistance to credit sales, the
                                unwillingness of the oil companies to increase Iran's oil liftings,
                                and the Shah's need to channel resources into development, the Shah
                                was having increasing difficulties in meeting his rising defense
                                requirements. He therefore found it necessary to seek out the
                                cheapest source of supply, which is now the Soviet Union. This is
                                regrettable, but the Shah has seen no alternative.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>While the United States is understandably fearful of any Soviet
                                presence in Iran, the Iranians have been dealing with the Russians
                                for many generations. They have a “feel for the real dangers.” Now,
                                the more immediate danger is from the revolutionary Arab
                                world.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KK1">Khosrovani</persName> is not
                                at all convinced that “all is lost.” So far as he knows, the Shah
                                has not been pressing Moscow hard for an answer. The Ambassador
                                believes that if we can provide fairly promptly a forthcoming answer
                                to the present negotiations, the Shah may not feel it necessary to
                                go forward with his Russian explorations. He hopes very much that
                                whatever misunderstanding that appears to have come between us will
                                easily be overcome. He knows the Shah has no desire to change in any
                                way the essential relationship between our two countries. He hoped
                                very much to be able to see Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We ourselves have been puzzled and frankly somewhat annoyed by the
                                Shah's approach to this problem. In 1964 we provided $200 million
                                for a 5-year defense program.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Within less than two years the Shah raised another $200 million
                                for defense purposes; and then appeared to expect us to immediately
                                respond. We did provide a special military mission to examine the
                                problem.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>While the Shah may have felt that this was not entirely
                                sufficient, it made substantial recommendations which we actively
                                pursued toward another $200 million—more than doubling our
                                assistance within a five-year period. While we were examining this
                                problem, we were suddenly informed that he is seeking assistance
                                from the Soviet Union. (The Ambassador replied we should not have
                                been surprised—we had had plenty of warning from the Shah's
                                advisors.)</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>We have never argued that he wasn't independent or that he didn't
                                have the power to make his own decisions. Of course he did. Indeed,
                                as a long-time student of politics outside of North America and
                                Western Europe, I fully understood the desire of governments to
                                demonstrate their independence. All we were attempting to do was to
                                make quite sure that the Shah understood that in choosing this way
                                of demonstrating his independence, there could be serious
                                consequences, however unpredictable. As the Secretary and I have
                                pointed out before, it was impossible to predict how the Congress
                                would react if Iran, an old and close ally against Communism, began
                                to accept substantial quantities of military equipment from the
                                Soviet Union. It also raised the problem of protecting the security
                                of our advanced equipment. This was not like India, where no
                                advanced equipment had been sent. The fact of the presence of Soviet
                                technicians in Iran would pose us considerable difficulty. The Shah,
                                I knew, would take these considerations into account as he attempted
                                to add up what he considered to be to the best advantage of
                                Iran.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>We both expressed our pleasure at seeing each other again and discussing this
                        matter once more. We both hoped nothing would stand in the way of continued
                        close collaboration between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>He expressed the hope that he could greet Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        before he went on leave tomorrow afternoon—simply a courtesy call of a few
                        moments, if that were possible. (He had obviously reported home he was
                        seeing Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>, and wanted to be able to report home
                        that he had seen him.)</p>
                    <p>I told him I would do my best to arrange a convenient time, though I made it
                        clear it would be difficult to arrange on this short notice.</p>

                        <item>Conversation with Kermit Roosevelt</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You know Kermit Roosevelt. He is Vice President, Gulf Oil Company. He is also
                        President, Middle East Institute. No American knows the Shah of Iran as well
                        as does Kim. While he was still abroad he communicated with his secretary
                        here in Washington and asked her to arrange a meeting with me upon his
                        arrival. Therefore, the meeting which I now report was held with some sense
                        of urgency.</p>
                    <p>I learned its urgency as soon as we sat down to talk. The Shah saw Roosevelt
                        for over three hours. Roosevelt's main conclusion is that the Shah feels
                        that his special relationship with his closest friend, America, is coming to
                        an end. The Shah feels that it is coming to an end because of the
                        indifference of his American friends. American indifference hardly balances
                        the scales because the Shah's input includes Iran's contribution to South
                        Vietnam, Iran's recognition and assistance to Israel, Iran's standup fight
                        against the incursions of Nasser, etc. The Shah feels that it has been a
                        one-way street and that the United States does not really care any more what
                        happens to Iran. He concludes that America does not care because what
                        concerns the Shah does not concern the United States. The Shah is tired of
                        being treated like a schoolboy, particularly by officials of the Agency for
                        International Development. He believes that <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss> has no legitimate claim upon his right to his own views and
                        to his own policies. The Shah cites, also, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s handling of his arms package.
                        This is a story in itself.</p>
                    <p>The story is that the Shah feels that the United States is charging him more
                        money in interest for a Hawk Battalion than anybody else. He feels that the
                        money Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> wants to
                        charge him for other military items is usurious and discriminatory.</p>
                    <p>Because of this maltreatment the Shah concludes that America does better by
                        its enemies than it does by its friends. The Shah is certain that Nasser is
                        given quicker and fairer treatment than is Iran. He spells out chapter and
                        verse to show that the United States has shown no gratitude for his support
                        in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the current withdrawal of British power from the Middle East, the
                        Shah has led the way in realizing that this power vacuum <pb n="300"
                            xml:id="pg_300" facs="0328"/>must be filled and that Iran can relieve
                        the United States of an appreciable part of the cost. Roosevelt says the
                        Shah believes that Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and perhaps Iraq can hold
                        the line against Nasser and the U.S.S.R., but they must have the support and
                        understanding of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Shah realizes that the reason why the Soviets have not yet responded to
                        his overtures for arms is because the Shah wants <gloss target="#t_SAM1"
                            >SAM</gloss>-2's and the Soviets do not want these missiles placed in a
                        country which has an American military mission. The Shah knows that the
                        Russians would like to respond positively but must hesitate over the
                        question of missiles for Iran. The Shah wondered aloud to Roosevelt over how
                        the United States and Iran could have arrived at a parting of the ways.
                        Heretofore, the United States had realized the importance of Iran and its
                        geographic location. The Shah's relations with the United States have been
                        confidential, cooperative, and rewarding for both sides. The Shah could not
                        understand how the United States could charge him more interest than it
                        charged others. This seemed to be the last straw.</p>
                    <p>Roosevelt said he had reported this conversation to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>. He had also seen <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> early this morning. Rostow did
                        not seem convinced of the seriousness of the situation, Roosevelt thought,

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bob:</p>
                    <p>I hesitate to draw your attention away from other serious matters but I would
                        like to call to your attention a situation of immediate danger to our
                        relations with Iran. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations <pb n="301"
                            xml:id="pg_301" facs="0329"/>Committee I was charged with the duty of
                        studying the Middle East, including Iran. Throughout the years I learned
                        that nothing is certain in that area except trouble, and that only quick
                        footwork at the right time can avoid serious pitfalls.</p>
                    <p>I know you share my deep appreciation for the Shah's contribution to the
                        struggle in Vietnam, for his staunch defense of our policies during his
                        recent swing through the Satellites, and for his unfailing support of the
                        United States in the field of mutual defense. The fact that he is now
                        turning to the Soviet Union to purchase arms is regrettable. Our
                        intelligence services report that his movement toward the Russians could be
                        far more serious than the immediate issue at hand. I wonder if the situation
                        is correctable?</p>
                    <p>I think we all would feel much better knowing that you had taken a personal
                        look at the commercial details we are proposing to the Shah and hearing from
                        you that you believe it proper to accept the high risks we are informed are
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            451 from Tehran, July 28, which conveyed a message from <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> to the President arguing that
                            before the Shah got inextricably involved in an arms deal with the
                            Soviets, the United States should make one last effort to avoid a
                            serious set-back for U.S. interests in the area. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> stated that the only hope of
                            avoiding excessive Iranian military involvement with the Soviets was an
                            indication from the U.S. Government of better prices and terms. The
                            Ambassador regretted bringing this matter to the President's personal
                            attention, but because there was so much at stake—not the least of which
                            was U.S. strategic installations in Iran—he felt compelled to appeal
                            personally to the President. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 19

                            saying that he did not want to send it to the President until he had
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName

                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that State's position was that
                            they should not ask <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                            take on another $30–$40 million in defense spending for this, and that
                            it would not be proper for the United States to be blackmailed. The
                            Secretary said that he was nervous about the behind-the-scene U.S.
                            commitment from previous years and would not object to a little
                            loosening up there. (Memorandum of telephone conversation between

                        believes we should not try to impose this extra $30 million military aid
                        burden on the Department of Defense and that, on balance, it might be good
                        for us to see some slight loosening in our ties to the Shah. He has always
                        been a little uneasy about our commitments to him.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believes that we
                        should stand on our present position; although he is willing to consider
                        helping marginally if his military aid is fully restored. But basically he
                        does not wish to give in to the Shah's “blackmail.”</p>
                    <p>I have a feeling that, whatever we do, the Shah is likely to buy some Soviet
                        equipment because it would be good for him domestically, indicating that he
                        is not wholly “subservient” to the U.S. and “normalizing” his relations with
                        the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> points out, there
                        are certain risks in our present position. The Shah might behave
                        irrationally and get in much deeper with the Soviets than we now calculate.
                        On the other hand, he is asking to be treated like a grown up. Your letter
                        to him was in a mature mood of partnership. I agree, therefore, that we
                        should stand on our present position.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me possible—but not sure—that if we stand on your letter and do
                        not go rushing in with an additional “carrot,” the Iranians may come back to
                        us with a specific proposition which we might look at.</p>

                                        deemed essential for Iran's defense. <persName

                        willingly to make some hard choices, cutting out some of the less important
                        items of equipment which would not fit under his financial ceiling. This in
                        itself is a gain, since the Shah has talked recently as if he were going off
                        the deep end buying everything in sight.</p>
                    <p>They believe that they dissuaded the Shah from buying Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s but expect that he probably will buy a few
                        anti-aircraft guns and trucks which he can get there at much lower prices.
                        They explained to him quite frankly that our offer of F–4 aircraft was
                        conditional on how far he went in getting equipment from the U.S.S.R. The
                        Shah vowed that he would not allow Soviet technicians in Iran, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName> believe he will not permit serious penetration of his
                        country.</p>
                    <p>The Shah summarized the discussion as “constructive, comprehensive and
                        expensive.” The upshot of it is that we will send a technician to Tehran to
                        negotiate some of the military details while the Governor of Iran's Central
                        Bank, who will be here next week on another project, will negotiate
                        financial details in the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>I think we have come out of this pretty well. I would not be personally
                        worried if the Shah were to buy a few minor Soviet items, although every
                        breach in the wall makes it more difficult for other leaders like King
                        Hussein to resist Soviet blandishments. Nevertheless, I think both your
                        letter and your sending <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> out
                        there have gone a long way toward keeping the Shah from going overboard. We
                        will undoubtedly have to adjust to his increasingly independent tendencies,
                        but for the moment we have managed to keep the worst we had feared from
                        happening.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>The opportunity you have so kindly afforded me with your warm and cordial
                        letter of July 20, 1966,<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">
                            <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> to discuss some questions
                        of mutual interest is greatly appreciated, particularly as there has been a
                        lapse of some time between our correspondence. I entirely agree with you on
                        the necessity of candor between friends.</p>
                    <p>I am in full agreement with you, Mr. President, that our co-operation in
                        military matters has been cordial and to the interest of both countries.
                        Indeed, it is my strong feeling that this co-operation has been of much
                        greater service in that it has contributed effectively to the maintenance of
                        the peace of this region—a region fraught with danger and which, in my
                        opinion, merits closer, deeper and more sympathetic attention, if we are to
                        preserve, at least, the semblance of peace it now enjoys.</p>
                    <p>It gives me much satisfaction to note your interest in the continued
                        stability of the Persian Gulf area. This area and my deep concern over its
                        security have occupied my attention for some years. I have often discussed
                        the problem with high American officials who must have reported my views to
                        you. I feel that a strong and stable Iran can serve as a deterrent to any
                        country around, which would, with scant respect for human or material loss,
                        keep the region in a condition of constant turmoil only to further its own
                        expansionist policy.</p>
                    <p>The unfolding situation in the area and its potential danger, as you have
                        well put it, Mr. President, requires close scrutiny in order to provide
                        against it before it is too late.</p>
                    <p>It is essential for Iran to enjoy peace and tranquility in order to be able
                        to carry through her social and economic reforms now well under way. A
                        strong Iran can, not only ensure such a condition, but also avert the
                        spreading of conflicts in the region, guarantee the smooth and orderly flow
                        of oil to the west and, what is of vital importance and worthy of serious
                        consideration, forestall the repetition of current tragic and costly
                        involvements. I therefore make no apology for repeating that the advantages
                        of a strong and friendly Iran to the west should not be denied or minimized.
                        It is my ardent hope that with our community of feeling and interest this
                        co-operation and the happy and cordial association between our nations will
                        continue to grow stronger and be consolidated.</p>
                    <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0342"/>
                    <p>I fully realize that your resources are burdened by your heavy commitments in
                        other parts of the world and I feel grateful to you, Mr. President, for your
                        concern for Iran's security and for your continued intent to respond to
                        Iran's needs despite these commitments.</p>
                    <p>While I was writing this letter to you, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HTW1"
                            >Hoopes</persName>, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense arrived in
                        Tehran and called on me with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Armin
                            Meyer</persName> your Ambassador and Major General <persName
                            corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>. We had a long and useful
                        discussion on various aspects of Iran's military requirements. He gave me an
                        account of your difficulties and limitations which I fully realize.</p>
                    <p>I do not intend to go over what we discussed since Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> will certainly make a full report to
                        you. What I would like to stress here is the great responsibility I feel
                        towards my people in this troubled area of the world. My most sacred duty is
                        the safeguarding of my country's independence and territorial integrity.
                        Unfortunately, I can see little relief in the troubled Middle East
                        situation, and future generations will not forgive me if I fail to pay every
                        attention to my country's defense requirements.</p>
                    <p>I have given instructions to my government to sign the necessary documents
                        for the 200 million dollars credit, though this figure, I must say, still
                        falls short of meeting Iran's needs.</p>
                    <p>We have always maintained that from all standpoints, political, economic,
                        strategic and also from the standpoint of helping Iran preserve her position
                        as a factor of stability in this region, the production of Iran's oil should
                        be set at a level higher than what it is now. We see people around us who do
                        not even know what to do with their oil revenues.</p>
                    <p>I fully appreciate your interest in Iran's economic welfare and the progress
                        we have achieved. I am resolved to see that while we make provisions for our
                        defense requirements we do not jeopardize the rate of this progress. It is
                        in pursuance of this policy that I need to husband our exchange resources in
                        order to be able to cover the military requirements without hampering the
                        rate of our economic development.</p>
                    <p>I welcome the possibility of a meeting between ourselves some time early next
                        year. I have always found these personal contacts highly satisfactory and I
                        look forward with much pleasure to this meeting with you. In the meantime
                        may I express, Mr. President, my high esteem for you and the great
                        importance I attach to the warm and deep friendship which binds our two
                        countries.</p>

                            would affect vital and highly vulnerable Kharg Island oil installations.

                            F–5 squadron at $15,000,000 which would be based at Bushire and would be
                            equipped with Sparrow missiles. He asked that <gloss target="#t_DOD1"

                            procurement and Shah again gave categoric assurances that he would buy
                            no Soviet <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s. I said this welcome news
                            for as he knew purchase of any major sophisticated sensitive weaponry
                            from Soviets would be incompatible with U.S. sale of F–4. Shah expressed
                            gratification that circumstances have developed so as to permit him to
                            rely on traditional US supply of sophisticated equipment. He recalled
                            how from start he anxious maintain maximum U.S. procurement and that in
                            any case air force should remain completely American oriented. Although
                            again mentioning that F–4's “very expensive,” Shah gratified to be able
                            purchase such high quality aircraft.</item>

                            corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> to talk about his arms purchases. We
                        do not recommend a reply now because his letter completes the circuit for
                        the moment. However, if you approve, we will ask Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> to tell him at an appropriate moment
                        that you appreciated his letter and will be in touch with him later. Unless
                        something unexpected comes up, your next letter would probably be later in
                        the fall, confirming arrangements for a talk early next year.</p>
                    <p>The Shah has taken heart, I think, from our explicit recognition of the
                        importance of stability in the areas surrounding Iran. He uses that
                        recognition as an excuse for underscoring the importance of his security
                        needs. He is appreciative of our help, which he realizes is a strain in view
                        of our Vietnam commitment, but he states frankly that our $200 million
                        credit still falls short of meeting Iran's total requirements. He welcomes
                        the prospect of a meeting with you early next year but does not sound as if
                        he will press for more aid then.</p>
                    <p>We have come out of this exercise pretty well. <persName corresp="#p_HTW1"
                            >Hoopes</persName> spelled out our problems in detail but couched them
                        in sympathy for the Shah's aims. The Shah has since assured Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> that he will buy no Soviet
                        missiles and allow no Soviet military technicians into Iran. A Soviet
                        military mission is in Tehran for talks this week, but he says he will buy
                        only vehicles and maybe some simple ack-ack guns, if anything. He is buying
                        some naval equipment from Britain, but our only objection to that is the
                        possible impact on his development program. On that, we'll just have to wait
                        and keep an eye open to how the economy shoulders the burden of these arms
                        purchases.</p>
                    <p>So while the Shah will increasingly move toward a position more independent
                        of us, we have managed to keep him from jumping too quickly this time. Some
                        independence is to be expected and is healthy. We just <pb n="318"
                            xml:id="pg_318" facs="0346"/>want to be sure he doesn't go too far too
                        fast and get us all in hot water. For the moment, we've succeeded.</p>

                        make clear to the Shah the dangers to US-Iran relations if Iran should

                    <p>At the conclusion of the conversation, the Shah said that a purchase of
                        sophisticated equipment from the Soviet bloc was “improbable.” A week later
                        we were able to obtain categorical assurances that Iran would make no
                        purchases of Soviet <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s or other
                        sophisticated equipment. Also, in the course of the conversation, the Shah
                        decided that Iran required only one Hawk battalion instead of two;
                        subsequently, he told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName> that he intends to purchase no Hawks, but to base his
                        air defense on an early warning radar system, fast-reaction interceptor
                        aircraft (F–4 and F–5), and simpler, less expensive antiaircraft guns. As a
                        face-saving gesture in view of his overtures to the Soviets, the Shah
                        restated that he would probably buy a few “lorries, <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                            >APC</gloss>'s and ack-ack guns” from U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>Agreement was also reached during the conversation on the major components of
                        a sales program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67. This would total
                        $110 million (comprising $60 million from the original 1964 credit and the
                        first $50 million of the new $200 million credit). The agreed elements of
                        this tranche are: Blue Shark radar system, one F–4 squadron, four C–130s,
                        additional air force war reserve, and about 100 M–60 tanks. Draft Letters of
                        Offer have been prepared on these items and will be carried to Iran by an
                        ILN team for negotiations beginning on 19 September.</p>
                    <p>We now have evidence that Iran has just about concluded the purchase of a
                        naval package from the U.K., including 4 Corvettes, 6 hovercraft (fast
                        patrol boats), and a refitted (but not modernized) WW II destroyer. In
                        addition to the naval items, the package includes 18 additional Tiger Cat
                        antiaircraft missile launchers and appropriate missiles. The total cost is
                        estimated at $60 million. This purchase has been anticipated. It will
                        confront the US Government over the coming months with the need to determine
                        the extent to which this third country purchase by Iran will affect the
                        total of the new US credit. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 tranche
                        will not however be affected.</p>
                    <p>On balance, we believe the situation is now well in hand.</p>

                    <p>Set out in the paragraphs below is the Embassy's assessment of the internal
                        security situation in Iran prepared in accordance with instructions from
                            <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                        (Department Airgram A–11 of July 21).<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">Not
                            printed. (Ibid., Central Files, POL 23–1 IRAN)</note> You will note that
                        since last October when we submitted our last formal report on the
                        counter-insurgency situation here (A–281 of October 20, 1965),/2/no major
                        changes have taken place in the situation as we viewed it at that time.
                        However, the moves toward settlement of the Kurdish revolt in Iraq this year
                        and some evidence that the growing number of Soviet technicians is
                        outrunning the capacity of the security services for effective surveillance,
                        point to possible longer-term problems. There has also been a negative
                        development in the reorganization of the Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps
                            (<gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss>), hitherto regarded as the most
                        effective counter-intelligence force in the government, which will bear
                        continuous close scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>As noted in the Embassy's recently-prepared semi-annual assessment of the
                        political situation in Iran (Embassy's A–104 of August 23, 1966),<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d178fn3">Not printed. (Ibid., POL 2–3 IRAN)</note> the period
                        since our last assessment has been characterized once more by the relative
                        placidity of the internal scene. It has been years since the political
                        atmosphere has been as sluggish, as self-satisfied, or as resigned to the
                        status quo. This is related only partly to the effectiveness of political
                        controls. It is in large measure attributable to economic prosperity and to
                        the Shah's success in giving the impression that a reorientation has taken
                        place in Iran's international position. There is more popular confidence in
                        the regime and less carping criticism. A rising new middle class is on the
                        march economically and, in the short run at least, appears to be developing
                        an interest in political stability. This situation could change, of course,
                        if the Shah should be assassinated, or if a serious slowdown in present
                        economic momentum should take place.</p>
                    <p>The favorable economic situation and the reduced level of popular
                        dissatisfaction have had the effect of dampening political activities of all
                        kinds. The Communists are in disarray, their fortunes probably at the <pb
                            n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0350"/>lowest ebb in years. They certainly
                        can take little heart in the increasingly obvious efforts of the Soviets and
                        the Communist orbit of Eastern Europe to deal directly with the Shah himself
                        on a government-to-government level. The religious opposition remains
                        unreconciled to Iran's increasing modernity and, while there have been
                        rumors of an unholy alliance between the right-wing religious oppositionists
                        and left-wing elements, so far nothing actually has materialized. With the
                        surrender of the Qashqai bandit Bahman Khan earlier this year the last
                        vestige of rebellion among the southern tribes disappeared from the scene,
                        at least for the time being.</p>
                    <p>However, there is some evidence of increasing activity on the part of the
                        Iranian Kurds. The apparent negotiated settlement of the Kurdish revolt in
                        Iraq reached late last June was generally well-received by the Kurds in
                        Iran. The end of hostilities, however, also set in motion a latent
                        nationalist fervor among this minority group due primarily to the
                        expectation that the Iraqi Kurds would gain certain advantages and
                        privileges from their acceptance of the cease-fire. This tendency probably
                        is best reflected in what has been described by Embassy sources as a general
                        increase in political activity, particularly among Kurdish groups in the
                        Mahabad area. The Iranian Government appears to be watching this unsettled
                        situation warily and has developed a renewed interest in the National
                        Resistance Movement (<gloss target="#t_NRM1">NRM</gloss>). So far, however,
                        we have no evidence of any major shift in <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> policy vis-a-vis the Kurds.</p>
                    <p>Although some Iraqi leaders continue to believe to the contrary, the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> appears to have discontinued purely
                        military assistance to the Iraqi Kurds, and has closed the Iraqi-Iranian
                        border in the Kurdish area. So far, although there are the usual cases of
                        smuggling and banditry, Iranian Kurdistan appears peaceful. We do not
                        believe that political activity on the part of Kurds in Iran which might
                        affect drastically Iranian Kurdistan will develop in the near future. Iran's
                        central security organizations appear quite capable of handling any
                        situation likely to develop.</p>
                    <p>While Iranian security forces appear capable of handling any political
                        activity likely to develop in Kurdistan, they are having their difficulties
                        elsewhere. At the present time, the greatest security problem is of a
                        long-term character. The Iranian security forces clearly are unable to keep
                        the steadily rising number of Soviet technicians in Iran under effective
                        surveillance. The number of Soviet personnel in Iran in connection with the
                        steel mill, pipeline, and other projects is approaching 600 and likely to
                        surge beyond that figure. The Iranians, however, have taken a number of
                        administrative steps to aid in controlling more effectively the movements of
                        Soviet officials more or less permanently stationed in this country. The
                        Embassy also hears that a number of dossiers concerning suspicious
                        activities on the part of the Soviets are piled up on the desk of the Shah.
                        We believe that Iranian security forces are keeping especially <pb n="323"
                            xml:id="pg_323" facs="0351"/>careful tabs on possible contacts between
                        Soviet technicians and Iranian Communists.</p>
                    <p>Speaking once more of the Communists, Savak is showing interest in long-term
                        threat posed by the Chinese Communists. The latter have not been able to
                        form any organization within Iran, but have been successful in their
                        propaganda activities among Iranian students in Europe. An increasing number
                        of these students have begun to show Communist Chinese sympathies and some
                        of them apparently have even visited China. The Chinese have flooded Europe
                        with publications which are having an effect on Iranian students some of
                        whom can be expected to return to Iran and to attempt to conduct subversive
                        activities. Savak believes that students returning from abroad will have to
                        be checked very carefully lest the Chinese Communists get a foothold in
                        Iran. Although Savak believes that the pro-Soviet group now dominates the
                        Tudeh party, it feels that the Chinese Communists, considering that they
                        have been laboring under the double disadvantage of being newer in the field
                        than the Soviets and of having no official representation in Iran, have done
                        very well to date. For this reason, Savak will continue to observe closely
                        the activities of Chinese Communist elements.</p>
                    <p>The decentralization of the Counter Intelligence Corps (<gloss
                            target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss>) of the Iranian Armed Forces has reduced
                        its effectiveness markedly. <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> units in the
                        field have been transferred from the administrative and operational control
                        of <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> Headquarters in Tehran to the units
                        to which previously they had been attached only. Thus, all reporting on
                        security matters now must pass through channels via the unit commander who,
                        if he sees fit to do so, may suppress the reports rather than forward them
                        to the Supreme Commander's Staff (<gloss target="#t_SCS1">SCS</gloss>).
                        Given the well-known Iranian penchant for not reporting matters which
                        superiors do not wish to hear, security reports are more often suppressed
                        than forwarded to headquarters. In addition, decentralization takes away the
                        capability of <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> units in the field to
                        respond quickly to an urgent request from <gloss target="#t_CIC1"
                            >CIC</gloss> Headquarters for operational support on an espionage or
                        subversion case. Under the new arrangement such requests must be dispatched
                        through command channels to the lower <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss>
                        unit. In the past <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> Headquarters sent a
                        message directly to the unit concerned. A study is now underway, however, to
                        determine how to retain such support from the field without taking away the
                        prerogative of the major commander concerned. The decentralization has had a
                        deleterious impact on the morale of the <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss>
                        as has also the fact that it is still smarting from the incompetence of its
                        previous commander. Although a new commander, a professional intelligence
                        officer, has been recently appointed, it is problematical whether he will be
                        able to restore the <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> to the level of its
                        previous effectiveness when it was regarded as the top security organization

                    <p>We continue to find valid the judgment made at the time of our last report
                        (March 19, 1966 letter to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"

                        there are no disturbing elements in the present situation requiring
                        counter-insurgency measures. On the program side we continue to be
                        interested in support for the National Police and in communications for the
                        Imperial Iranian Gendarmerie (<gloss target="#t_IIG1">IIG</gloss>). In this
                        latter connection we have obtained from the <gloss target="#t_IIG1"
                            >IIG</gloss> an idea of the program it desires and have forwarded to
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> via Genmish channels our comments
                        and suggestions. The <gloss target="#t_IIG1">IIG</gloss> has obtained from
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> a pledge of support which we believe
                        approaches 50% of the total cost. The total cost of this communications
                        project is $10.2 million. With the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        apparently prepared to put up $5 million and with $2.2 million already in
                        the program for <gloss target="#t_IIG1">IIG</gloss> communications, this
                        means that $3 million needs to be financed over a five to six year period.
                        We would be grateful for any help you feel you might provide in getting this
                        project on the rails. We think it is of the utmost importance in any
                        counter-insurgency situation likely to develop in Iran that we have an
                        effective command and control system for operations in the countryside.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>At a meeting yesterday in London, the Iranian Government gave the Oil
                        Consortium one month in which to present proposals in response to <pb
                            n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>the Government's demands. Officials
                        of American companies belonging to the Consortium told us yesterday
                        afternoon in Washington that, while they continue to hope we will help
                        restrain the Iranians from precipitate and unilateral action, they would
                        prefer that we not become involved in the substance of the issues as they
                        are working on their position.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the attitude of the American companies, we do not recommend
                        that you raise this subject this evening with Iranian Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName>. If he, however, raises the
                        subject, you might say that we continue to view the situation with concern
                        and believe that it was a wise decision to allow a month's time for further
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>We anticipate that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>
                        will speak to the Shah along these lines today in Tehran.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the annual Consortium-Iranian meeting two weeks ago in London, the
                        Iranians asked for a 17 percent increase in Consortium production for each
                        of the next two years. If the Consortium could not achieve this rate of
                        increase, the Iranians requested an advance payment based on the difference
                        between a 17 percent increase and the actual increase. The Consortium has
                        declined to agree to this demand, pointing out that it is unable to predict
                        in advance any rate of increase in the light of changing market conditions.
                        The Consortium has told the Iranians that it hopes to increase its
                        production 10–11 percent this year. The Mideast average increase will be 7–8
                        percent.</p>
                    <p>After receiving the Consortium's negative reply to their first proposal, the
                        Iranians asked that the Consortium make available to Iran to market on its
                        own account, presumably to Eastern Europe, crude oil at cost. The Iranians
                        suggested that the Consortium guarantee an annual production increase of 12
                        percent and deliver to them an amount of crude oil annually for the next
                        four or five years equal to the difference between the actual increase and a
                        17 percent increase. At yesterday's meeting, the Consortium declined to
                        agree to this demand, but requested and obtained a month's time in which to
                        consider possible alternative proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Iranians have informed the Consortium and the British and American
                        governments that they are considering another proposal under which they
                        would ask the Consortium to relinquish all its Iranian reserves of oil
                        except those required to meet a minimum acceptable annual increase in
                        Consortium production. The Shah has indicated that Iran will if necessary
                        take legislative action to achieve this end. Such a move would be contrary
                        to the Consortium-Iranian agreement of 1954.</p>
                    <p>Iranian motives appear to be a combination of two elements. One is a need for
                        increased foreign exchange receipts to meet the needs of a vigorous
                        development program and to cover the costs of rising military imports. <pb
                            n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>The second is a desire to get into
                        the business of marketing oil for their own account.</p>
                    <p>It is not certain what new proposals will be developed by the Consortium. The
                        oil companies will seek a solution within the 1954 agreement. They will not
                        consent to an arrangement under which they would guarantee a specified rate
                        of increase in offtake from Iran because they would then be subjected to
                        similar demands from other producing countries. They will also not consent
                        to an arrangement under which the Iranians obtain oil at cost to market in
                        competition with the Consortium. They believe that the Iranians intend to
                        market any such oil not only in Eastern Europe and that Iranian oil exports
                        to Eastern Europe would permit the Soviets to increase their sales to
                        existing Consortium markets.</p>
                    <p>The Consortium operates in Iran under an agreement reached in 1954 which
                        terminated the crisis set off by Mossadeq's nationalization of the
                        Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. in 1951. The members of the Consortium are British
                        Petroleum (40%), Shell (14%), Standard of New Jersey (7%), Standard of
                        California (7%), Texaco (7%), Mobil (7%), Gulf (7%), French Oil Co. (6%),
                        and eight independent American companies (5%).</p>

                            Nov. 1 outlined to Shah purport of Manila Conference. He stressed it was
                            impressive demonstration of unity of purpose of seven countries with
                            troops fighting in Vietnam to repel aggression. At same time conference
                            concentrated on pacification program as well as determination for
                            negotiated peaceful settlement. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                                >Harriman</persName> stressed we want South Vietnamese left free to
                            make their own decisions and referred to six months withdrawal pledge.
                            He noted that appeals for US to stop bombing come from same sources
                            which prompted 37-day pause year ago with only result being increase of
                                <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0355"/>North Vietnamese
                            infiltration and military build-up. He added US ready cease bombing if
                            there any indication willingness on part of NVN achieve just settlement.
                            Unfortunately, such indications lacking. Meanwhile, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and its six fighting allies determined
                            neither to escalate the conflict nor to shirk their

                        <item>Shah said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has no alternative but
                            to continue what it is doing. He reviewed development his own position.
                            In March 1965 during trip to South America he stressed there is clear
                            case of aggression against South Vietnam and <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> doing right thing in taking military action to repel
                            it. In June 1965 during his visit to Moscow Shah stressed if Chinese not
                            stopped by Americans in Vietnam all of Southeast Asia would be overrun
                            and in any case Soviets contradict themselves by endorsing Nasser's
                            military actions in Yemen. This past summer in East Europe Shah had
                            stressed that US doing job <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be
                            doing, that it is unfair and illogical to ask one party to withdraw
                            unilaterally, and that attention should rather be focused on getting all
                            parties to peace table. Shah cited improved situation in Indonesia as
                            tremendous success and reason why solution in Vietnam could be
                            negotiated settlement rather than military victory.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> pointed out that there
                            is no chance of Communists gaining victory and in fact their capability
                            and morale being steadily reduced. Nevertheless Peking and Hanoi give no
                            signs wanting peace, apparently delighted keep US bogged down and hoping
                            one day Americans will become discouraged and pull out. Since there no
                            chance of securing Peking's support for peace, chief hope lies in
                            getting Soviets to bring decisive influence to bear on Hanoi. This hope
                            been slightly reinforced by attitude displayed by Gromyko during his
                            recent Washington talks.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Shah said his trips convince him neither Russian nor East European
                            countries want war. They all determined improve welfare their people
                            because their people demanding it. Moreover, Soviets strongly oppose
                            Chinese expansion. He had that day seen report that Hanoi is asking
                            Soviets and East Europeans to provide “volunteers” as envisaged in
                            communiqué after recent Moscow conference of Socialist countries. Shah
                            convinced this Hanoi ploy is inspired by <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s to put Soviets on spot. He said President Ayub

                            by intense nationalism.</item>

                            convinced Romanians can have no influence on <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s re Vietnam. Only hope is, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> had indicated, via Russian
                            influence on Hanoi. Shah said he had seen another report to effect

                            Czechs so keenly interested in promoting Vietnam peace they might have
                            salutary influence on Russians toward this end. Shah also had strong
                            impression from his East European visits that Poles, and others fear
                            Germans more than Russians and this factor deters them from acting as
                            independently from Moscow as they would like.</item>

                            caution, however, is in order, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                                >Harriman</persName> said, noting that while communism as a system
                            is no longer marketable commodity, Soviets still actively support “wars
                            of liberation.” They not beyond dusting off Tudeh Party one day and
                            causing Shah trouble. Thus while detente with East Bloc is good, it well

                        <item>Shah fully endorsed <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                            view. Russian objectives he said are historic. He recalled post-war
                            Soviet efforts to get positions in Dardanelles, Libya and Eritrea. Now
                            they seeking bases at Alexandria, Djibouti and Yemen. As far as Iran
                            concerned, Shah said he under no illusions. Daily clandestine broadcasts
                            make clear Soviet designs to oust Shah and his regime. Also indicative
                            are vicious propaganda attacks Moscow is making against Islamic
                            “understanding” concept which Faisal and Shah had discussed. Soviet
                            tactics, Shah said, have, however, changed. Any crossing of Iran's
                            border by Soviet troops would mean world war. Soviets realize this and
                            accordingly are working via Egypt and Syria, both of which wittingly or
                            unwittingly are staging areas for Soviet designs for achieving Mideast
                            warm water ports. Asked if he really convinced Nas-ser under Soviet
                            control, Shah said Nasser doing better job for Soviets in Cairo than if
                            they had “someone there by name of Popov or Litvinov.”</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Shah went on to outline his thesis, developed more fully within last
                            year or so, that it is not wise for country like Iran to consider
                            dependence on even as good a friend as U.S. as “essential part of our
                            defense policy.” Great power intervention anywhere these days is “more
                            difficult,” (he obviously thinking of Vietnam). It therefore imperative
                            for Iran to develop capability of taking care of itself in deterring or
                            coping with regional threats, even though he must pay high U.S. prices
                            for equipment. Danger, he said, will be at its height within next five
                            years, particularly after 1968 when British withdraw from Aden.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> agreed that
                            British withdrawal was unhelpful, particularly since expense of keeping
                            British forces in place is relatively small. Shah felt Iran's <pb

                        <item>While agreeing that Iran have adequate self-defense, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> made strong point of
                            keeping military expenditures down. He stressed that economic
                            development and prosperity are as important if not more so in
                            preservation of Iran's independence and integrity. Shah agreed, provided
                            that minimal defense requirements are met.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Shah then launched into his usual argumentation on need for increased
                            revenues from oil consortium in order to maintain 8 percent growth rate
                            for Iran. He noted that while he is told that his demands are exorbitant
                            oil lifting from several other countries are well above 17 percent
                            annual increase which Iran must have. He added that these other
                            countries have small populations and do not know what to do with their
                            excessive incomes while for Iran, which is largest of these countries,
                            17 percent increase is critical. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                                >Harriman</persName> repeatedly urged Shah to be reasonable and
                            avoid repetition of 1951 “tragedy.” Shah said he did not wish 1951 be
                            repeated but he should not be forced into corner. He alluded to
                            proposals which he had forwarded to U.S. via <persName corresp="#p_AA11"

                            noted his request for crude been reduced to 2,000,000 tons. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> took occasion to refer
                            to likelihood Romanians selling refined Iranian crude to West Germans

                            be self-defeating for Iran, Shah insisted it would not occur but he
                            would check into it. Perhaps safeguard provisions, he said, could be
                            incorporated in any agreements. This portion of discussion was closed
                            with expression of gratification that Shah has taken steps to avoid
                            further public discussion of oil problem so that atmosphere most
                            conducive to reasonable negotiation can prevail.</item>

                        <item>Shah spoke of his high hopes for Iran's future. Only Japan and Iran
                            have possibility of attaining within next 20 years state of development
                            reached by European countries, he said, adding Iran has more abundant
                            natural resources than does Japan. Ambassador <persName

                        <item>At conclusion, conversation returned to Vietnam. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> earlier had noted that so many
                            countries privately support U.S. but refrain for domestic political
                            reasons from coming out openly. In departing he referred to De Gaulle's
                            Cambodia speech which demanded US withdraw but demanded nothing of
                            Vietnam. Similarly, Nasser, Indira Gandhi and Tito had just few days ago
                            in New Delhi made similar <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0358"

                                >Harriman</persName> pointed out that such public pronouncements,
                            besides not being impartial, have tragic effect of making Hanoi more
                            intransigent. Shah concurred.</item>

                        <item>At beginning and throughout conversation, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> made clear that purpose of his
                            visit was to exchange views with leader whose special friendship

                            valued. Shah was obviously gratified. He asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to convey his warm wishes and
                            abiding friendship to President Johnson.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Discussion was everything hoped for.
                            Shah obviously delighted that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> still
                            considers him important friend. Having known Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> since 1942, he was speaking
                            with trusted friend. At times, he sounded almost like Shah we knew in
                            days before present ballyhoo about “independent policy.” Under
                            circumstances, this talk tended to bring Shah back to moorings which are
                            deeper than vagaries of current Afro-Asian politics. This does not mean
                            there will be any turning back from Iran's present “independent”
                            posture. But it may mean that swing of pendulum may be a little slower
                            than it has been since Shah's East European visits. All in all, stopover
                            here was decided success. For Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                                >Harriman</persName> it was a long day, he having started from New

                            journey to Rome prior to heavy round of talks there tomorrow. We
                            grateful he agreed to this extra task which was accomplished so

                        <item>He takes satisfaction in his new contacts in Eastern Europe but is
                            under no illusion that Moscow would not take an opening of weakness to
                            cut his throat. He no longer fears open aggression from the north but
                            knows that the Tudeh Party is alerted to sieze any opportunity to cause
                            him trouble. He believes Moscow is working through Nasser and now Syria
                            in a flanking maneuver. The foothold in Yemen will be expanded when the
                            British leave Aden through southern Arabia to the Persian Gulf. Iran
                            must be strong enough to face this threat alone without our
                            intervention. However, his military expenditures should not interfere
                            with Iran's economic and social progress to attain a southern European
                            living standard. Iran and Japan are the only two eastern countries that
                            can aspire to this goal.</item>

                        <item>He pleads for our help to make oil companies realize it is more
                            important to increase Iranian oil production than that of the small
                            princely states in Arabia. I urged caution in military expenditures and
                            patience in dealing with oil companies and not to kill the goose. The
                            Shah takes justifiable pride in Iran's economic growth of over 10 per
                            cent per annum for the last two years without rise in cost of living. He
                            was obviously pleased that you sent me to consult him and looks forward
                            to talking with you personally in Washington, hopefully in June. All in
                            all it was a friendly conversation combined with a glass of excellent
                            scotch and ample of Iran's best caviar.</item>

                    <p>2453. For Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. Following
                        subjects may come up in your talk with Shah:</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Iran's Orientation. Although still publicly proclaiming “independent
                            policy,” Shah has no illusions re Commie aims. His visits to East
                            Europe, steel mill project and stepped up trade with <gloss
                                target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> Bloc were hailed as new look in Iran
                            policy. Some of glamour seems be wearing off, however, particularly
                            pursuant to Moscow efforts to roil waters during recent Iranian
                            discussions with consortium. Surveillance of <gloss target="#t_Sov1"
                                >Sov</gloss> Bloc activities here is intensive and some inevitable
                            frictions developing as Iranians and <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss>
                            Bloc reps try to do business. You may wish commend Shah for cautiousness
                            in dealing with <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> Bloc and note that
                            reduction in tensions with his northern neighbor is also of benefit to
                            U.S. assuming, of course, that relaxation not accompanied by diminution
                            in long-standing U.S.-Iran friendship.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Iran's Stability. Due to economic boom, internal stability is at new
                            high in Iran. Shah deserves good marks for economic and social progress
                            notably Literacy Corps, Health Corps and land reform program. Shah
                            determined modernize Iran a la Europe before he lays down reins.
                            Hopefully he will not bite off more than Iran can chew. Hopefully also
                            future will include political progress.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Viet-Nam. Shah will welcome opportunity exchange views on world's
                            number one problem. Privately he supports <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> policy but except for little publicized medical team in
                            Viet-Nam he refrains from public support. Because of improved Indonesian
                            situation, Shah has “shifted” his view from firm military riposte in
                            Viet-Nam to negotiated settlement. He probably favors extended bombing
                            pause. He would be particularly gratified if there were useful role he
                            might play in achieving settlement.</item>

                                7. (Ibid., PET 6 IRAN)</note> re State of play. In general Shah can
                            be commended for his staying within bounds of reason.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Military. As you know Shah believes Iran must be capable of deterring
                            or coping with regional threats and he thinks this is in <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest. He been heavily influenced by
                            Viet-Nam and by <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> plight last fall. He
                            has been publicly critical of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                            (for unfair reasons) but intends <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"
                            />continue membership until acceptable replacement available, i.e.
                            greater regional cooperation including hopefully Afghanistan. Without
                            sales talk re <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>'s future, it might
                            be useful to remind Shah that Iran's <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                                >CENTO</gloss> affiliation has had value, e.g. $800 million in US
                            military aid to Iran, while permitting Iran's peaceful development, and
                            cause of shift in Soviet tactics. If subject of our military credit
                            sales comes up, you might point out that despite our preoccupations with
                            Viet-Nam <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did quite well by Iran last
                            summer, e.g. first country except Brits get F–4 aircraft, relatively
                            reasonable credit terms despite stringency of <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> supporting funds, etc.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Arab Threat. Shah sincerely concerned that Nasserism will emerge on
                            southern coast of Persian Gulf, e.g., overthrow of Kuwaiti regime or
                            some vague <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> extension from Yemen-Aden
                            base after British withdrawal from Aden. As counter, Shah is less
                            interested in retention British power than in building up his own
                            capability. Without arguing potentiality of threat, it may be useful to
                            point out that while adequate self-defense necessary (and we have
                            recognized that) Iran's best bet is healthy economic and social
                            development which will thwart more sinister forms in which threat likely
                            to occur.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Cooperation with Paks. Shah has stayed close to Ayub to prevent too
                            close <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> association with <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. Shah may press you for approval
                            of M–47 tank transaction which is part of quiet and small scale effort
                            of Shah to permit Ayub source of supplies other than from Commies. You
                            may wish indicate we realize value in Shah's keeping window open for
                            Ayub but note that our whole policy re Pakistan's military needs is
                            under discussion.</item>

                            Baghdad when you are here. Shah does not expect substantive progress in
                            relations with Iraqis but wants give public indication Iran's friendly
                            disposition if Iraq determined stay out of Nasser's clutches.</item>

                    <p>2499. Secretary's Talk With Shah. Following are highlights of more than three
                        hours' discussion between Secretary and Shah evening 12th: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Presidential Greetings. Secretary said he brought personal
                                greetings from President who is always interested in Shah's views on
                                subjects of international import. Shah asked that greetings be
                                reciprocated and expressed hope that President's health is fully
                                restored.</item>

                            <item>China. Secretary explained that with respect to Viet-Nam Soviets
                                are hesitant to play peace-making role because of their relations
                                with China. At Hanoi there is enigmatic situation but chief obstacle
                                is China. Destruction of culture, except for nuclear science
                                activities, is indicative of bellicose and ultra-nationalistic
                                character of present <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                                regime. Secretary opined that two <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                    >ChiCom</gloss> trends are to be feared: a) increasing
                                militancy; or b) accommodation with the Russians which would again

                                mentioned by Secretary he would prefer former for U.S.S.R.-CPR
                                rapprochement could only occur if Soviets moved closer to <gloss

                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, Shah said, are
                                fanatical ideologists whereas Soviets are adjusting primitive
                                Marxist philosophy to more acceptable system since pure Marxist
                                system has proved failure.</item>

                            <item>Viet-Nam. Secretary reported current situation in Viet-Nam and

                                aspects Secretary emphasized our forces cannot be defeated. He
                                stated <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will persist until a

                                and said US should not be deterred by students and other critics.
                                Secretary pointed out there is growing unhappiness in American
                                public opinion at lack of support by our friends and allies. War in
                                Viet-Nam has changed from organized military conflict to primarily
                                guerilla warfare. Particularly needed is assistance in constabulary
                                endeavors. Shah parried this cue by asking why is there Viet Cong.
                                Secretary said Viet Cong in part result of totalitarian tactics of
                                Diem regime, particularly oppressive propensities of Diem's brother.
                                Shah noted Hanoi is equally totalitarian. Secretary pointed out Diem
                                regime was ruthless enough to alienate people but not as ruthless as
                                Hanoi regime in enslaving the populace. Secretary expressed hope
                                that recent elections, constituent assembly and other developments
                                might lead to more wholesome South Viet-Nam political situation.
                                Shah thought key need is strong leadership. (Secretary has asked
                                Ambassador to follow up with Shah matter of constabulary
                                assistance.)</item>

                            <item>East-West Trade. Shah expressed wholehearted approval of current
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policies for building trade
                                bridges with Eastern Europe. From his visits, he could testify that
                                those countries want increased independence. He cited his efforts to
                                sell oil in East European markets which, he is convinced, are
                                noncompetitive with consortium markets. Secretary wondered whether
                                Soviets and Romanians are truly in need of oil. Shah said Romanians
                                wish to use their high quality crude for sophisticated purposes and
                                in any case the amounts of crude Iran will sell are relatively
                                small. While differing in character, all of the satellites in the
                                Shah's view are loosening their ties with the Soviets despite
                                latter's efforts to perpetuate their dependence.</item>

                                    >SAM</gloss>'s, Shah reaffirmed his decision not to buy any
                                sophisticated Soviet military equipment. To do so he noted would be
                                incompatible with procurement sophisticated American equipment and
                                would require undesirable influx of Soviet advisors. Shah indicated,
                                however, that active negotiations are in progress with Soviets for
                                purchase of anti-aircraft machine guns, noting Soviet equipment this
                                type less expensive than similar American equipment.</item>

                                declared firm friendship for Ayub. Shah appeared a bit miffed that

                                He claimed 60 percent of Iraqis are Shia and thus specially linked
                                with Iran. There is no reason, Shah said, why Iraq should be

                                    >PL</gloss>-480 program had helped US influence Nasser on number
                                of matters, e.g. moderating Nasser re Congo, re Libya and re Arab
                                boycott. Shah said Nasser wittingly or unwittingly serving as Soviet
                                tool and in any case is dissipating his resources on adventures when
                                he should concentrate on doing more for his people. Shah implied

                                resumed only if Nasser gets out of Yemen and stops agitating against

                                and main emphasis will be on development of agriculture. Shah said
                                he knows that increased world food production is subject of great
                                interest to President Johnson and he (Shah) is already formulating
                                some thoughts on this subject and what Iran is doing about it in

                                officials, including sharing of confidences, are highly useful

                    <p>The Secretary's blitz visit to Tehran was a complete success.</p>
                    <p>It was successful probably more from the standpoint of form than substance.
                        No thorny issues were raised by <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>. He did
                        not play his usual record of grievances against the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss>. Nor did he even broach the question of the dates of his
                        forthcoming visit.</p>
                    <p>However, for three hours the two were on almost exactly the same wave length
                        on world affairs. Not once was the phrase “independent policy” mentioned. On
                        the contrary, the thrust of the whole evening's conversation was thwarting
                        communist efforts everywhere in the world, not excluding Iran.</p>
                    <p>It was particularly helpful to have this pro-free world dialogue so manifest
                        at the dinner table. While <persName corresp="#p_AA7">Aram</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA11">Alam</persName> needed no shoring up, it was
                        good to remind <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> that Iranian
                        and American policies are still fundamentally in step. Sometimes our good
                        friend <persName>Amir Abbas</persName> tends to be carried away by street
                        plaudits vis-a-vis palsywalsyness with the Eastern bloc.</p>
                    <p>Even in the public domain one can feel the good effects of the Secretary's
                        visit. The mere fact that <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss> welcomed his
                        visitor and spent three hours in intimate conversation belied suspicions
                        that relations between the United States and Iran have cooled. One gets the
                        feeling around here that Iranians generally now realize that the detente
                        with the North has not greatly changed the relationship with our
                        country.</p>
                    <p>A dividend for you and me was that both the Secretary and <persName>Bill

                        Shah's dedication and profundity of knowledge. Like many others who have had
                        audiences, they know of few if any other Chiefs of State who have such a
                        detailed knowledge (tons of rice per hectare, for example) re matters in and
                        outside the country as does <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>. This
                        firsthand recent impression, coupled with the obvious progress which Iran is
                        making, should hopefully stand us in good stead whenever Iran's name comes
                        before the Secretary in future months.</p>
                    <p>All this does not mean that all of our problems are solved. Naturally <gloss

                        as he does the Secretary's Ambassador. Nevertheless, for the time being,

                            toward wishing progress more rapid than is realistic, he (<persName
                                corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>) is determined to maintain a
                            realistic “cruising speed.” Third plan he said has not attained all its
                            goals because it was too ambitious; unrealized objectives will be
                            incorporated in first year of new fourth plan. Re latter, private sector
                            industrial development is flourishing so well that major portion of

                            standing committee to keep an eye on it. As index of strength of Iranian
                            economy, <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> said black
                            market rate for U.S. dollars is now below official bank rate. He said
                            new tax law will be passed in Majlis within week and it will mean more
                            revenues. In addition, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> planning

                                >Hoveyda</persName> said, is his determination to govern by
                            persuasion rather than coercion and to rely heavily on private

                            great concern to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> said Iran with help of U.S.
                            advisors determined to have effective modernized armed forces. Increased
                            budgetary costs primarily due to building of “infra-structure.” One of
                            the difficulties of having thriving economy with burgeoning middle
                            class, he said, is that military personnel, particularly lower ranks,
                            require more amenities in face of soaring salaries of workers in private
                            sector. To train and keep adequate maintenance and operating staff for
                            modern equipment, therefore, requires such things as relatively decent
                            housing, etc.</item>

                        <item>Discussion turned to Iranian arms deal with Soviets and I expressed
                            concern at magnitude of reported transaction and my impression that
                            prices higher than necessary. <persName corresp="#p_HAA1"
                                >Hoveyda</persName> said it important keep in mind that except for
                            small component of Iranian-produced refrigerators, etc. repayment will
                            be made entirely in natural gas. Soviets wanted at least 30 percent
                            foreign exchange, but Iranians flatly rejected. While noting that
                            delivery schedule for proposed vehicles remains to be worked out,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> sketched out
                            repayment schedule extending to 1978. He said Soviets are charging 2–1/2
                            percent interest. First payments minimal and not significant before
                            natural gas pipeline completed in 1970. Problem, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> said, is what can Iran safely
                            obtain from Russians in return for natural gas. He solidly against
                            Soviet prestige projects. Steel mill is more than enough. Soviets been
                            pressing hard to build Tehran subway but he steadfastly opposed. Not all
                            of natural gas credit, even in first years after 1970, will go for
                            repaying steel mill. Thus repayment for trucks, <gloss target="#t_APC1"
                                >APC</gloss>'s and anti-aircraft equipment can be made via natural
                            gas with no strain. He noted that no Soviet advisors will come with
                            equipment.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> indicated that magnitude
                            of deal with Russians was heavily conditioned not only by ease of
                            repayment but also by Shah's determination not to be at Soviets' mercy
                            if crisis develops. Iran wants to have adequate quantity of spare
                            vehicles and spare parts should Soviet policy toward Iran change. He
                            noted in this connection that there are no <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340"
                                facs="0368"/>illusions anywhere in <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> that Soviet ultimate motivations have changed from what

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> expressed view that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should recognize that this deal
                            with Soviets undercuts Soviet propaganda branding <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> also has hope that
                            deal will throw some sticks in wheels of Soviet cooperation with <gloss

                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Throughout discussion I made clear that there bound to be
                            repercussions on US opinion. While we might understand Iran's rationale
                            there will be some on Capitol Hill who will wonder about Iran's
                            intentions and this could have adverse effect on our military programs
                            which involve <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds. More important,
                            however, is the impact on Iran's economy. I reiterated our stipulation
                            of last summer that each tranche of our future annual military sales
                            credit will be reviewed in light of economic picture here and that
                            President himself must give approval. I recalled specifically our having
                            made clear that purchases from other countries would be taken into
                            account. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be well-advised, I
                            said, to keep these factors in mind. In any case, both of us will be
                            going into the total situation thoroughly during our annual economic
                            review.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>With United States participation in the Allied occupation
                        (U.S.S.R.-U.K.-U.S.) of Iran during World War II, our role drastically
                        changed from an earlier cultural-missionary presence to a growing position
                        of influence in the country's affairs. Our assumption of leadership in
                        post-war affairs was initially a vacuum-filling operation. We replaced the
                        former rivals, Russia and Britain, whose days of shared hegemony ended
                        rather abruptly with the repulse of Soviet efforts to communize northwestern
                        Iran and the demise of Britain's South Asian empire. Britain's weakened role
                        was later confirmed by the conflict and break over nationalization of the
                        Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Active United States diplomacy in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s handling of the Azerbaijan crisis coincided
                        roughly with our assuming a greater portion of the British responsibility in
                        Greece, and in the strengthening of Turkey against Soviet claims to Kars and
                        Ardahan, which led to the Truman Doctrine of March 12, 1947. Economic
                        efforts under Point Four begun in 1950 established United States influence
                        in both the internal and external affairs of Iran. Since that time, the
                        importance of these northern tier countries, not the least being Iran, has
                        increased rather than diminished.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In the short term Iran is important to the United States because of its
                        strategic location and the defense facilities and privileges extended to the
                        United States bilaterally and through cooperation in the <gloss

                        of continuing importance to United States security interests that Iran be
                        seriously committed to modernize its political as well as economic and
                        social institutions and thus build the internal strength to foil insurgent
                        attempts, either by discontented <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0370"
                        />urban and rural elements, the Communist (Tudeh) Party or dissatisfied,
                        unassimilated tribal elements (Kurds in the west or Arabs in the south), or
                        obscurantist rightist groups such as Fedayan Islam opposing any basic
                        reform. The United States and the West have a stake in continuing
                        modernization of the political and economic structure. This is interrelated
                        to our narrow interest deriving from the $225 million in commercial
                        investments (including the American share in the consortium).</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>United States objectives in Iran are pursued within the framework of our
                        particular relationship with the monarchy of that country. The Iranian
                        monarchy provides the stability not yet available through popular
                        institutions or long popular experience in organized political affairs. It
                        is, at present, the sole element in the country that can provide continuity
                        for public policy. While there are areas of divergence between us and the
                        Shah, they have remained thus far more matters of emphasis than of essence,
                        not particularly significant within the broad consensus we share with him on
                        most of the really fundamental issues of foreign and domestic policy. While
                        the United States is not necessarily committed to the support of any
                        particular form of Government in Iran, the Shah at present affords the best
                        means for the safeguarding of our basic security interests in Iran and is
                        the only personality on the scene who can lead the anarchically-bent
                        Persians. Thus, until another potentially viable power source appears, which
                        we do not expect during the next two to five years, support for the Shah and
                        his reformist programs will form the basic condition of our pursuit of the

                    <p>III. United States Strategy in Iran</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">A. General</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our strategy for Iran must take account of the increasingly independent
                        position of the Shah. This limits our area of maneuver. It also defines a
                        major problem to which our strategy must address itself.</p>
                    <p>The key developments in recent years that underlie this picture of
                        independence are: (1) the Shah's successful concentration of power in his
                        own hands and the internal stability this has achieved at least for the
                        present; (2) the increase in oil revenues that has given the Shah relative
                        financial independence from the United States and, at the same time, has
                        provided a major instrument for his internal control of the country.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these developments, the Shah's independent position must be
                        understood as part of a longer run trend to which Mossadeq over a decade ago
                        had given new impetus—namely, the emergence of Iran from a quasi-colonial
                        status to one in which Iran would exercise the power over its own affairs
                        that is associated with full sovereignty. Major elements of a strategy
                        designed to move Iran forward in the next five years—politically,
                        economically and socially—toward a more stable base for the longer run must
                        be devised within this framework.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">B. The Independent Posture</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our strategy should be to respond as fully and as positively as we can,
                        consistent with maintaining our special bilateral security arrangements with
                        Iran, to the Shah's thrust toward a fully independent national posture in
                        the country's foreign relations. On the economic front, this would mean
                        adherence to our current policy of phasing out <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss> assist-ance. Again, with respect to our military assistance
                        program, we should <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0372"/>adhere generally
                        to the present policy of shifting the appropriate pace from grant to credit
                        sales on fairly hard terms and attempt to restrain the Shah's desires for
                        equipment and forces that we consider unjustified by the threat. Although
                        the days are over when we could dictate to the Shah what his military
                        establishment should be, we can continue to play an important role in
                        influencing Iran's military program, and in preserving a balanced
                        application of resources as between the military and economic fields,
                        provided this is done with tact, diplomacy, and a modest application of US
                        resources. While recognizing that the Shah now has the financial means and
                        market options to shift some of his procurement to non-US suppliers, we also
                        recognize that our mutually beneficial relationship with Iran is, to a
                        significant degree, based on our military training and supply
                        activities.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">C. The Means of Leverage</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our influence on both internal and external policy will have to be exercised
                        in somewhat different ways than in the past because our material assistance
                        is declining and because Iran is determined, after many years of almost
                        embarrassing reliance on American advice, to make at least a show of
                        independence. Recently this has been accompanied by an increase in foreign
                        (non-United States) technical experts serving in Iran including some 500
                        from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and other communist
                        countries, and by more varied offers of financial assistance from non-United
                        States sources. Our leverage in the past has resulted in large measure from
                        our economic, technical and military assistance, which has totaled $1,453.5
                        [sic] million ($706 million economic, $757.5 military, through <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'66) in the past 16 years.</p>
                    <p>While not uniformly successful in achieving the stated goals, these modes of
                        assistance have secured entree into the key administrative, economic, and
                        military circles and have contributed notably to the forward movement
                        experienced on most fronts during the past decade. At present our concrete
                        assistance is dwindling because of our resource limitations, Iran's growing
                        financial strength, and Iranian pride—sometimes not fully justified—in the
                        recent advances in domestic administrative capabilities. We ended direct
                        budgetary support in 1961 and completed the shift in our support for
                        development projects from concessional <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                        lending to Export-Import Bank loans in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'66.
                        We have gradually reduced our permanent technical advisory staff over the
                        past three years and have put the Iranians on notice that the Development
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> program will end soon. In
                        this transition period, which will come to an end in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss>'68, we will concentrate our efforts in such strategic
                        sectors as power and agriculture (rural development). We have shifted our
                        Food for Peace assistance from a local-currency to a dollar-credit sales
                        basis. In the military sphere, we are reducing <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> grants and shifting to credit sales, meanwhile retaining
                        our close advisory relationship.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately our multifarious operations in Iran since the early 1950's,
                        combined with Iran's reliance on us for fundamental security from Soviet
                        aggression, have established our reputation sufficiently within influential
                        government and private establishments that we need not look forward to
                        encountering blank walls as our material sources of leverage melt away.
                        Especially among the educated circles there is considerable acceptance of
                        the value of ties with the West and increasing agreement with the stress we
                        have been placing on modernization in all spheres of Iranian life.
                        Neutralistic and xenophobic sentiments remain to be exploited by demagogic
                        politicians, but it would take a major mishap to catapult such a one into
                        power.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, as time goes on, we will unquestionably be more on our mettle
                        to keep our advice sound and convincing in Iranian terms. Except perhaps in
                        security matters, where we may look forward to many more years of close
                        dependence on United States advice and support, we will be drawn less
                        closely into the decision-making process in the inner councils of
                        government, i.e., we will move more into the role of a trusted ally
                        (hopefully still the most trusted) and away from the earlier role of
                        responsible senior partner. When we are consulted on non-military domestic
                        and foreign policy issues, we must take increasing care to avoid repeatedly
                        offering advice which, however beneficial in an objective sense it might
                        seem to be, would be disregarded because the Iranians would be unable or
                        unwilling to act on it. It is hard to foresee how much disregarded advice
                        would add up to a general reduction of confidence in United States
                        leadership, but we must keep in mind that this consideration will be more of
                        a problem in Iran in the future than it has been in the past.</p>
                    <p>It has been a significant irritant in our relations in recent years that as
                        Iran sees it, we appear to take its dependence on us so much for granted
                        that we show greater concern for troublesome and uncooperative allies and
                        even neutrals than for Iran. As Iran's strength and its bent toward
                        independence grow, this type of irritant could well affect our leverage, and
                        it therefore behooves us to keep in mind the deference due, in both tone and
                        substance, to a staunch and increasingly proud ally.</p>

                        of the Shah from a position of power, either suddenly or as a result of a
                        well-coordinated coup. This and other contingencies will be the subject of a

                    </p>
                    <p>A limited response by the Shah to the pressures for broader political
                        participation, which are bound to increase during the period ahead, could be
                        an important factor in achieving the objective of a longer run stability
                        that we and the regime both seek. The 1967 elections may provide the
                        opportunity for a limited opening up of the system. Considering the time
                        required for planning and organizing broader political participation, we
                        should, as opportunities arise, continue to urge upon the Shah the
                        desirability of such an approach. He has occasionally indicted an interest
                        in building bridges to some of the more moderate nationalist figures in the
                        opposition. If the Shah could reach, in the next year or so, a decision to
                        permit at least a limited amount of popular choice in the next
                        elections—even if that choice were only between “approved” candidates, this
                        could be an important step forward in Iran's political development. United
                        States influence, diplomatically exercised, would support such a
                        strategy.</p>

                        agreement of 1959, we provide a security umbrella for Iran against Soviet
                        aggression. We should continue to support <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> as an arrangement of positive, if limited, value, whose
                        collapse would have a tangible disruptive effect in the Middle East. Our
                        official public statements have clearly indicated our willingness to oppose
                            <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"/>by various means aggression in
                        the Middle East, including Iran, from non-Soviet directions, though the
                        Iranians place little reliance on such statements. Our exclusive military
                        advisory relationship dates from 1947, but is based on the groundwork laid
                        by our army mission and Corps of Engineers during World War II. Since 1951
                        we have supplied military equipment of various degrees of sophistication, as
                        has befitted developing Iranian capabilities. A unique feature of our
                        military supply relationship with Iran has been joint forward planning which
                        we began on a five-year basis in 1962 and which has been useful in securing
                        agreement with the Shah on a reasonable schedule for equipment supply and on
                        the proper strategic mission of the Iranian armed forces.</p>

                        The memorandum contained assurances by the Government of Iran that its
                        program of military purchases would not cause undue strain on the nation's
                        foreign exchange reserves or jeopardize plans for the nation's economic and
                        social development. The agreement provided for a joint annual review

                    <p>It has not always been easy in the past for us to secure agreements on
                        military matters. The Shah, reflecting a consensus of high-level Iranian
                        opinion, has tended to regard Iran's 1955 decision to join the Western
                        defensive system as a claim for special consideration of various kinds,
                        especially economic and military assistance. In the early days of this
                        arrangement, the Shah tended to focus mostly on the latter. Obsessed with
                        Iranian weakness and vulnerability, and fancying himself as a military
                        strategist, he pressed us to support, with equipment grants and direct
                        budgetary assistance, a military buildup on a scale that far out-stripped
                        any conceivable progress in Iranian absorptive capacity and that threatened
                        to create a serious imbalance in the allocation of Iranian financial
                        resources. Since those days we have managed to scale down his military
                        establishment and our relationship has matured in many ways. As the Shah has
                        seen his resources increase and as his dependence on us has declined, our
                        negotiations are increasingly conducted on a basis of give and take in which
                        we must take into account the value that we place on our close and
                        cooperative military relationship. More and more he sees himself as a
                        potential purchaser who wishes simply to state his own requirements with the
                        hope that these can be met from US sources—but with alternative sources
                        clearly in mind. During the summer of 1966, for example, Iran negotiated a
                        $60 million credit sale agreement with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        for naval vessels, Hovercraft, and Tigercat missiles. The Shah momentarily
                        considered buying surface-to-air missiles from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> but decided to abandon the idea; he has nevertheless
                        reached agreement for purchase of non-sophisticated equipment from the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Since 1958 our military relationship has matured considerably. We have seen a
                        noticeable improvement in Iranian capacity and willingness to relate their
                        military effort to their overall economic development. Our task over the
                        next few years will be, within the context of our long-term agreements, to
                        meet the Shah's intense desire for military modernization—for which he is
                        now able to pay—sufficiently so that we can maintain the US as the primary
                        foreign military influence in Iran and to continue the United States
                        advisory services which have already begun to bear fruit in the form of a
                        gradually growing professionalism in the Iranian armed forces. A specific
                        objective would be to forestall any significant military relationship
                        between Iran and the Soviet Union. The Shah gave us categoric assurance in
                        Summer 1966 that he would not acquire any sophisticated military equipment
                        from the Soviet Bloc.</p>

                    <p>In the years ahead, we will continue to be faced with the Shah's concern
                        about the radical Arab threat to Iran. The Shah has become increasingly
                        concerned with possibilities of Arab attack on vital oil and military
                        installations in southern Iran, a viewpoint which is the result, partly, of
                        his observation of the negative US reaction to Pakistan's situation in the
                        Indo-Pak war and also his fears of increasing <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> penetration in the wake of what he considers to be an
                        inevitable British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf. He has asserted his
                        unmistakable intention to acquire the military equipment to meet this
                        threat. While responding to the extent possible to legitimate defense needs
                        and while seeking to concentrate the Shah's attention on real as opposed to
                        imagined threats to Iran's vital interests, we will have to be careful not
                        to strain his confidence in us by attempting to dissuade him from meeting
                        what he considers to be Iran's real security needs even if we ourselves
                        cannot supply the equipment he desires. The United States too has an
                        interest in the security of the Persian Gulf area, including its security
                        against inroads and pressures from the United Arab Republic. Although the
                        Shah is inclined to exaggerate the nature of the threat, if a real threat
                        develops, our interests lie closer to those of Iran than to those of the
                        United Arab Republic.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Thanks to effective political and security control, there is no immediate
                        serious threat to Iran's internal security. Iran abounds, however, in
                        classical potentials for insurgency, and the regime realizes the necessity
                        for vigilance against outbreaks, with or without foreign subversion, among
                        the tribes and border nationalities (Kurds and Arabs) and even among the
                        disparate but volatile urban opposition elements.</p>
                    <p>The United States has and will continue to play both a direct and an indirect
                        role in enhancing the capabilities of the regime to cope with potential
                        insurgency situations. Our most direct role is in the supply of technical
                        assistance to the urban police and the rural Gendarmerie (with whom we have
                        had an advisory mission since 1942). For the urban police, USAID civil-type
                        police assistance and advice have effected marked improvements in police
                        telecommunications, vehicular mobility, rec-ords and identification, and in
                        other civil police functions. In the military sphere, some of our equipment
                        grants and a good part of our advisory services have been tailored
                        increasingly to the techniques and theories of counter-insurgency. Iran has
                        formed a Special Forces Group (approximately battalion size) in Tehran.
                        Mobile training teams from the United States Special Forces have instructed
                        regular units of the Iranian army in unconventional warfare and
                        counter-insurgency in field exercises. Our direct role involves also a
                        considerable amount of persuasion toward more enlightened and long-term
                        means of dealing with potential insurgency situations (disaster relief,
                        labor development, economic rehabilitation <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351"

                        which the regime is so often drawn when the chips are down.</p>
                    <p>Our indirect role embraces virtually all of our other programs in Iran, since
                        they are all designed fundamentally to chip away at the roots of
                        disaffection and hence to increase the strength of the government.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>a. Continue to make clear to Iran, the U.S.S.R., and Iran's Arab neighbors,
                        through our military cooperation and general posture of support for Iran,
                        that Iran cannot be attacked without grave risks of direct United States
                        military counteraction.</p>

                        to delay a hostile military advance, and to combat indirect communist
                        aggression with a minimum of direct involvement by Free World military

                            hour audience with Shah 15th. We were accompanied by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>, Admiral Blackburn and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>. Shah took
                            occasion to reiterate his well-known views re importance Iran having
                            adequate defense capability.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Shah discussed changes taking place in the world and in this region.
                            He made clear that Iran continues to value its friendships and
                            alliances. Russian tactics may have altered but until Moscow renounces
                            its desire to see world dominated by communism Iran and other
                            non-Communist countries must remain “attentive.”</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Shah reiterated his usual theme that if Soviets cross Iranian border
                            there will be world reaction. More imminent threat in his opinion is
                            that in Persian Gulf area. British have reaffirmed their determination
                            to leave Aden in 1968 and, although they are increasing their capability
                            at Sharja and Bahrein, these measures are minimal and probably will last
                            only few years. He implied from reductions in <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> aid that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> also has
                            lessened interest in this area. He considered threat as coming from
                            “rectangle” of Cairo, Yemen, Somalia and Ethiopia, noting that latter
                            two countries are going through rather critical phase.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Shah reiterated his intention to have modernized adequate defense
                            capability and disclaimed any thought of territorial aggrandizement. He
                            noted that large quantities of Russian arms continue to flow to
                            countries like Egypt, Syria and Algeria. With such build-ups by
                            aggressive neighbors, countries like Iran cannot confine themselves
                            merely “to prayers and saying mass.” He had hoped to maintain exclusive
                            U.S. supply pattern, but with obvious reluctance of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to supply all his needs Iran has had to
                            resort to other sources. Nevertheless, he still values US-Iran military
                            cooperation, including good work of ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1"

                        <item>In stressing determination to assure security of Gulf area, Shah
                            mentioned Iran is staying in tough with Saudis. Also in interest of
                            regional security, Iranian cooperation is developing bilaterally with
                            both Turkey and Pakistan.</item>

                            purpose of his visit was to gain first-hand familiarity with countries
                            for which <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss> has
                            responsibilities, <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0381"/>both from
                            contingency basis and with regard to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            assistance. He noted that in about one month he will be required to
                            testify on Capitol Hill where opinion is running heavily against
                            military programs, grant or sales. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> noted that Indo-Pak hostilities
                            had been among the developments which have colored Congressional
                            thinking and there is widespread sentiment in the United States,
                            particularly in Congress, that it is morally wrong for <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to fuel arms races in developing
                            countries when their limited resources were better spent on vital
                            economic development. Shah expressed view that had it not been for
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> military cooperation with
                            Pakistan and India hostilities would have broken out earlier and
                            cessation would not have been achieved as quickly as it was. He
                            expressed regret that members of Congress do not see that their attitude
                            endangers countries with peaceful intentions like Iran and Morocco while
                            playing into hands of aggressive ill-intentioned countries. All this led
                            to discussion re possibilities of securing Soviet cooperation re
                            limitation of arms supplies to developing countries. Shah saw no
                            prospect of such Soviet cooperation in foreseeable future.</item>

                        <item>General <persName corresp="#p_CGTJ1">Conway</persName> alluded to
                            Shah's implication that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest in
                            this area is lessening and said this not so. He added that contrary to
                            some press speculation re effects of US commitments in Vietnam, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> military capability remains ample to
                            play role in other contingencies should that be necessary. Shah
                            indicated he already aware of this, but he wondered about Washington's
                            political readiness to get involved in future brush fires.</item>

                        <item>There was brief discussion of Soviet interest in natural gas from Iran
                            and more recently a Soviet offer to buy oil. Shah noted that new Soviet
                            pipeline being built to Europe (info supplied via <persName

                                >reftel</gloss>) but saw some advantage in having power as large as
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> heavily dependent on small
                            country like Iran for commodity like gas. Ambassador pointed out rich
                            foreign exchange rewards Soviets would gain. This obviously on Shah's
                            mind for he spoke vaguely of demanding from Soviets some “triangular”
                            transaction whereby Iran would gain certain additional benefits. He also
                            mused about the costliness of a pipeline direct from Iran to European
                            natural gas market. Shah also noted how Romania in particular and to
                            lesser extent Czechoslovakia are defying Soviet desires for maintaining
                            Soviet economic hegemony over European satellites. In general Shah said
                            efforts at bridge-building with Eastern European countries are desirable
                            provided vigilance is maintained.</item>

                    <p>Telegram 169774 to Tehran, April 6, 1967, informed the Embassy that the
                        Justice Department review of the Gudarzian criminal case had concluded that
                        the only realistic course of action involved proceedings based on forgery of
                        the two large checks bearing the names of the Prince and Princess. Chances
                        of conviction, however, were not considered good in the absence of testimony
                        from <persName corresp="#p_EAH1">Ebtehaj</persName>. In light of previous
                        Embassy arguments that a Gudarzian acquittal would be worse than no trial at
                        all, the Department had concluded that it should not ask the Department of
                        Justice to pursue the criminal case further. The Immigration and
                        Naturalization Service was prepared to commence deportation proceedings
                        immediately upon being authorized to do so by the Justice Department. Unless
                        the Embassy objected to these conclusions, it was requested to advise the
                        appropriate Iranian officials of this decision and the reasons for it.

                        deportation proceedings against Gudarzian and Kushan. <persName

                        <item>At this point we doubt Shah has specific proposals to make re water
                            and food. His interest in these subjects as major world problems has
                            been greatly stimulated by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1"
                                >Udall</persName>'s visit and by various public pronouncements made

                            which we have supplied Shah. He knows these subjects are high priority
                            in Washington and is developing his own thesis, still in embryonic form,
                            that world should get its mind off international quarrels and address
                            its united attention to great problems of tomorrow on this planet. Shah
                            is determined limit population growth in Iran.</item>

                        <item>Shah is convinced that water is limiting factor in food production,
                            notably in Iran. In his talk with Rome Daily American editor Galling
                            (Tehran A–559),<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">Dated April 18. (Ibid., SOC
                                13 IRAN)</note> Shah noted that in addition to desalination Iran
                            would have to pump water up to 4,000 foot plateau which doubles cost. He
                            is nationalizing “every drop of water” as tenth point of his “White
                            Revolution,” a move which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1"
                                >Udall</persName> suggested was as perspicacious as Teddy
                            Roosevelt's nationalizing forests (which already been done in Iran).
                            Beyond these general points, we know of no specific projects which Shah
                            might propose by way of desalination, etc. Our hope, however, would be
                            that some small consultative project might emerge from Shah's
                            discussions with President and our impression is that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> and his able aide
                                <persName>Frank Diluzio</persName> have already given thought to
                            something along this line.</item>

                        <item>Re food production, Shah's basic thesis is that there is no reason why
                            Iran should not be self-sustaining which it already almost is. However,
                            due to limiting factor of water, Iran will not be able to develop into
                            significant food exporter. Shah's belief is that Iran can make salutary
                            contribution to food production in this entire region by supplying
                            fertilizers from large petrochemical industry presently under

                            Iran, more recently California Water Commissioner, and presently Vice

                            develop commercially 100,000 acres of wheat production in Khuzistan.
                            This fits in with Shah's conviction that while his land reform program

                            4-hectare plots which been awarded peasants. Shah is immensely impressed
                            with large-scale agriculture in U.S. and wishes have Iran follow U.S.

                                higher than 5 percent unquestionably would deprive U.S. of

                                however, should payment period be less than eight years.</item>

                        At the same time, noted the rapid projected increase in Iranian military

                        agreed that the credit negotiators be authorized initially to offer a 5–1/2%
                        rate, with the offer of a 5% rate to be made as required in the course of
                        the negotiation. Noted in this connection the critical importance of not
                        handling this aspect of the negotiation in such a way as to lose the overall
                        political gain we seek from the transaction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Agreed</hi> that the recommendations to the President
                        should be ready for forwarding to him by May 12 in order that it will be
                        possible for our Ambassador to meet with the Shah on this matter prior to
                        the Shah's departure from Tehran for Europe on May 23 and in order that the
                        credit negotiations can be completed prior to the Shah's arrival in
                        Washington on June 12.</p>

                        repaid the credit, and the foregone 1/2% interest which, assuming an even
                        repayment schedule over the 8-year repayment period, would approximate $1 to
                        1–1/2 million. Agreed that a statement of the cost to the U.S. should be
                        included in the memorandum of recommendation to the President.</p>

                        <item>Upon my arrival at large luncheon given 10th in honor of
                            Ambassador-designate <persName>Hushang Ansary</persName>, PriMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>, obviously in great
                            state of distress, handed me copy of UPI story dated May 9 reporting
                            statements by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>
                            and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1"
                                >McNaughton</persName> during recent closed-door hearings of

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Story quotes <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> as
                            saying Iran's recent arms purchases from Russia and U.S. “are largely to
                            maintain Shah on his throne.” Story says <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1"
                                >McNaughton</persName> agreed arms not scheduled for use “against
                            Russia.” Story said remainder <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1"
                                >McNaughton</persName>'s explanation was deleted. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> said he had been impressed by
                            recent conversation with “very intelligent young man from Iran” who
                            warned that further repression of freedom in Iran is bound to result in
                            revolution. <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> quoted as
                            saying, “We are following a wrong course and very unwise one to
                            encourage Shah to maintain complete political control.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> reportedly agreed Shah has
                            “displayed a good deal of independence.”</item>

                        <item>During middle of luncheon PriMin was called to telephone by Shah who
                            had just read story and was highly indignant. He told PriMin <pb n="362"
                                xml:id="pg_362" facs="0390"/>to ask us for text of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>'s statements which had been
                            deleted. According to PriMin, <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                                >Fulbright</persName>'s allegations were offensive enough but Shah
                            wishes to know what was response of official <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> spokesman. Shah told PriMin that until <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attitude is clear his trip to
                            Washington must be considered in suspense.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Both before and after Shah's phone call, I tried my best to calm
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> down and to enlist
                            his cooperation in bringing Shah down from chandelier. I pointed out
                            that criticism leveled at Shah was relatively minor compared to that to
                            which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials themselves,
                            including President Johnson, are subjected. Expressed personal opinion
                            that deleted testimony dealt with Shah's reasoning for acquiring
                            adequate defense capability. Went on to say that best way to meet
                            criticism reported in UPI story was for Shah himself to tell his story
                            in his usual impressive manner. I asked Ambassador-designate <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> to assist also.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Naturally cancellation of Shah's Washington visit can have untold
                            adverse repercussions in our relations with this country. Hope <gloss
                                target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> can provide us soonest with gist, if
                            not text, of <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>
                            testimony and that it will be of nature to put issues <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> raised in better perspective.
                            In addition it would be helpful to have other testimony favorable to
                            Iran given by official <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> spokesmen.
                            Finally, it might be worth sending us for relay to Shah some personal
                            words of friendliness from Secretary or even President.</item>

                                xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"/>would in any way detract from our view

                            development and social reform and the leadership Iran has displayed in
                            helping to mitigate international disputes. Executive Branch spokesmen

                                <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> That letter spoke of
                            the “continuing comradeship between our two nations,” of “our desire to
                            help Iran,” of our pride in having “contributed to the gathering
                            political and economic strength of Iran under (the Shah's) wise and
                            skillful leadership.” The President stated that he wanted to meet with
                            the Shah to discuss problems of “common concern” and “to hear directly
                            from (the Shah) more about the heartening economic and social progress
                            Iran has made.” It is in this spirit that we look forward to the Shah's
                            visit. We sincerely and deeply hope that the Shah will go forward with
                            his plans.</item>

                        <item>Apparently what irked Shah most was injection into public media of
                            unchallenged suggestion by <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                                >Fulbright</persName> that Iran becoming ripe for revolution. Shah
                            was appalled that chairman of such an influential body as US Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee could believe and make public as his own
                            views those of an itinerant student who walked into his office. He had
                            assumed <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> would be fully
                            briefed by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> but if Chairman's
                            judgement to be gauged by this episode, “Heaven help the United
                            States”.</item>

                        <item>Obviously deeply wounded because he considers himself in forefront of
                            world's progressive leaders and is profoundly proud of Iran's successes
                            under his leadership, Shah contrasted Iran's progress and freedom with
                            that of other Afro-Asian countries, particularly so-called “progressive”
                            states which he presumed liberals like <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                                >Fulbright</persName> favor. He said he ready make referendum in
                            Iran tomorrow and all but smallest fraction (mostly few American or
                            British trained maladjusted Iranians) would register enthusiastic
                            approval of Iran's reforms and economic and social development. It is
                            absurd to think that Western-style democracy could be automatically
                            transplanted to countries like Iran, he said, adding that nevertheless
                            Iran is making progress in democratic procedures in accordance with its
                            cultural traditions and state of its economic development.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We went round and round. I recalled Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> during his visit here had told Shah
                            there bound to be reaction on Capitol Hill to Iran's closer relations
                            with Soviets. I emphasized freedom to dissent in US and noted that
                            present administration does not have much leverage on Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>. Assured him, as Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s message made clear,
                            prevailing U.S. opinion, certainly that of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>, appreciates good work which being done in Iran. It
                            would be shame, I said, if Iranian student who spoke to Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> would be allowed to
                            “defeat” Shah. Best counteracting course, obviously, I said, is for
                            Iran's story to be told more widely and there no better opportunity than
                            Shah's forthcoming Washington visit.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>I pointed out Secretary's reassuring message represented official
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> view. Shah asked I convey his
                            deep appreciation for Secretary's timely and welcome words. He described
                            both President Johnson and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> as great and good friends. Problem, he said, is
                            that Secretary's message is confidential. Meanwhile, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>'s charges will pre-sumably
                            get world-wide publicity. I told him I not aware that UPI story has
                            gotten much play. Shah expressed hope some means could be found to
                            counteract via public media implications <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                                >Fulbright</persName> allegations. If these allegations get
                            publicity here, he said, there would be no alternative but counter
                            publicity.</item>

                        <item>After first-half our of slow going, I found best way to get Shah into
                            normal frame of mind was to discuss other subjects, e.g., Viet Nam, <pb
                                n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0393"/>Turk visit, Hussein's visit,
                            etc. Separate telegrams re these subjects will be sent tomorrow. But
                            without fail Shah would return to bitter subject of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>'s unwelcome remarks. I urged
                            Sermon on Mount reaction or that of Lincoln that best way to destroy an
                            enemy is to make him a friend. Shah recognized this as good philosophy
                            but it clearly not an ingredient of Persian mentality.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>While Shah never could get himself to give unqualified affirmative, I
                            came away convinced that he will proceed with plans for Washington
                            visit. Tactically, I felt it better to leave with relatively good
                            feeling we had achieved at conclusion our long talk and leave
                            negotiation of further details re Shah's program for later discussion
                            between Court Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA11">Alam</persName> and
                            myself. I have strong doubts, however, that Shah will be willing to go
                            through with planned tea with <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"

                            comparatively cooperative in permitting us to expand exclusively United
                            States facilities in Iran. Also, he has exercised a moderating influence

                            is because of my concern that the viability of this entire complex may
                            be affected by the conversations that you and others will have with the
                            Shah that I am taking this means of underlining the significance of his

                        <item>This may be the last occasion that we will have to deal with the Shah
                            as a Middle East leader committed to the United States. I have been
                            impressed that, despite his détente with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> in matters of aid and trade, his cooperation with us

                            and his own posture in dealing with hostile Soviet intelligence
                            activities in Iran have remained, among Middle East leaders, almost
                            uniquely unambiguous. But he has become impatient over the years with
                            our insistence that Iran is militarily threatened only by Soviet forces
                            across the Iranian-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> border. He is
                            genuinely convinced that Soviet support of radical nationalist forces
                            led by President Nasser constitutes a threat to the more moderate
                            elements. He feels that <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0395"/>this
                            threat must be met primarily by a coalition of moderate Middle East
                            countries pursuing a new policy of self reliance. He appears determined
                            to assume the leadership in this new regional alliance but will come
                            seeking United States understanding and a level of support necessary to
                            deter the aggressive actions of those regimes supported and used by the

                            Communist China.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Shah has repeatedly stated that the ultimate answer to Communism
                            is social and economic progress, and he feels that he has demonstrated
                            this in Iran. He may, during his visit, propose a long-range development
                            program for southern Iran and raise the question of a major development
                            program for all the Gulf as the answer to Soviet and <gloss

                        <item>The Shah, like most of the leaders in the Middle East, is filled with
                            growing anxieties about both the ability and the will of the United
                            States to remain a Great Power and a reliable ally in his part of the
                            world. Determining our intentions will be the objective uppermost in his
                            mind. His appreciation of our position will, I think, become apparent in
                            the course he pursues when he returns to Iran. Other political leaders
                            in the Middle East, not to mention those in Moscow, will be acutely
                            sensitive to his reactions and consider them in contemplating their
                            separate interests and policies in the area.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>You have already agreed to one office meeting with the Shah after his 5 p.m.
                        arrival on 12 June, and you are having dinner with him that evening.
                        However, the Shah is anxious to budget a second meeting with you the next
                        day.</p>
                    <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>
                    <p>Normally, I would stand firm against a second meeting on any but a State
                        visit. However, in this case there is a great deal to talk about. Moreover,
                        the Shah is a person you can talk seriously with. We have invited him over
                        here primarily to convince him that you are deeply aware of the great
                        changes taking place in the Middle East as they concern him, and I think it
                        would be worth going along with him.</p>
                    <p>We could arrange to keep the second meeting off the schedule so it would not
                        create a formal precedent for later visitors, though it would become known.
                        I am sure the Iranians would go along with this.</p>
                    <p>The alternative is to wait and see how things go at the first talk and
                        schedule a second meeting then if you want. To carry this off, we should
                        probably be in a position to suggest to the Iranians now that we wait and
                        let you and the Shah decide. This tack seems attractive, but if you're
                        likely to agree to a second meeting, we'd probably gain by scheduling it
                        informally now.</p>

                    <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommend that you approve the
                        second $50 million slice of the $200 million military sales credit for Iran
                            <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>that you approved in May 1966.
                        They would like to get word to the Shah before he leaves on 22 May for a
                        series of State visits that will bring him here 12 June. This credit will
                        finance the second squadron of F–4's that you approved last August.</p>
                    <p>When you approved the $200 million planning figure a year ago, we were
                        concerned that this might be more than Iran's economy could safely take on.
                        We therefore insisted that each slice be subject to your review and
                        instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> that he
                        and the Iranians should thoroughly review Iran's economic situation before
                        recommending release of further installments.</p>
                    <p>One of our motives was simply to force the Iranian economists and politicians
                        themselves to look hard at their allocation of resources between defense and
                        development. We think this device has paid off. The Iranians have improved
                        their management of foreign exchange reserves, and their economic homework
                        for this year's review was much better than last year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> concludes that Iran can handle
                        this additional purchase safely. He does not believe it will cut into the
                        capital investment necessary to keep the growth rate up to at least 7%. The
                        World Bank and Ex-Im have done their own studies and independently reach the
                        same conclusion.</p>
                    <p>We do not want to be over-optimistic. Therefore, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommends that, in informing the Shah
                        of your decision, <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> reiterate our
                        continuing concern that the Shah keep military expenditures within bounds
                        and keep his military purchases from the Soviet Union to a bare minimum.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> for political reasons
                        recommends a slightly concessional 5% rate with 8-year repayment (compared
                        with the normal Ex-Im rate of 5.5% over 8 years). Treasury has gone along.
                        The only cost to us is that Defense must set aside an additional $3.7
                        million in its sales fund. This will be freed again as Iran repays, so the
                        only “real” cost is about $1–1.5 million in lost interest. In view of our
                        extensive intelligence facilities in Iran and the relationship we are trying
                        to maintain with the Shah, I think this is justified.</p>
                    <p>We are concerned, of course, about increased arms levels in the Middle East.
                        However, we recognize that the Shah has genuine worries about an eventual
                        threat from radical Arab forces in the Persian Gulf area as the British
                        presence diminishes. This will be very much on his mind when he talks with
                        you in June. While we would hate to see him go overboard, we have already
                        argued him down from much higher levels of purchases and believe we have
                        struck the best balance we can. We would rather have him buying from us
                        under some control than buying wildly elsewhere.</p>

                        the coordination of this recommendation. I recommend you approve.</p>

                                IRAN)</note> would redound strongly to Shah's disadvantage as it
                            would indicate sensitivity not becoming sovereign of a proud, strong and
                            independent nation and would damage his reputation here as it
                            undoubtedly would become known. At present <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                                >Fulbright</persName>'s remarks have received no publicity here.
                            Moreover, as you have pointed out to Shah, Iran's story merits telling
                            to key Senators and the Senators want to hear it as is evidenced by
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>'s

                            as his host. You might wish stress to Shah that this recommendation
                            comes from Shah's friends, who have considered carefully the pros and
                            cons and believe this course is in best interest of US-Iranian

                                of social reform are impressive evidence of Shah's determination to

                                concern should be conveyed to Shah: (1) steadily increasing demands

                                evidenced by projected 12.9 percent annual rate of increase in
                                military expenditures over next five years and by 6 percent in 1966
                                to 9 percent in 1972 proportion of <gloss target="#t_GNP1"

                            Shah 22nd expressed conviction Annual Review indeed a useful process for
                            all concerned. Projections which been developed, I noted, unusually
                            realistic and valuable in providing statistical indicators of Iran's
                            present and future economic progress.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Shah said Central Bank projections were very much on conservative
                            side. They did not take adequately into account revenues which bound to
                            accrue from budding projects, e.g. in petrochemical and agricultural
                            fields. Basic problem, Shah said, is not so much Iran's economic <pb
                                n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>wherewithal as it is trained
                            human resources. I concurred that Iran's absorptive capacity is limiting
                            factor to both economic development and military modernization.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>After commending Iran's current and projected growth rate, I noted
                            that perhaps Iran's greatest problem is its success. Burgeoning economic
                            development, accompanied by budgetary and foreign exchange deficits, can
                            cause inflationary pressures. Shah noted prices been relatively stable
                            and GOI intends to keep them that way, e.g. by foreign borrowing. We
                            both agreed it is important to keep watchful eye on this problem.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Noting that plan organization expenditures this year due to increase
                            by record 34 percent, I emphasized importance of economic development to
                            Iran's stability and security. At same time, noted that military budget
                            increased each of past two years by over 20 percent and while rate is
                            due to decline it will still be 12.9 percent at conclusion coming
                            five-year period. Said PriMin and we had gone into this matter
                            thoroughly and had ascertained that increased military expenditures are
                            due to such reasons as fact that Iran now must buy its spares instead of
                            obtaining them via grant aid. Nevertheless, this too is matter which
                            requires constant control. Shah said problem is to keep military budget
                            down but present developments in Mideast underscore need for Iran's
                            maintaining adequate defense capability. He recalled Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> some years ago lecturing him
                            to effect that scarcely any countries except <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and USA need have military establishments. He said he
                            had asked <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> whether
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would guarantee existence via US
                            armed forces support of every nation whose independence comes under
                            threat. Shah said same question is even more pertinent today. Shah's
                            view is that it is in Iran's and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s
                            interest that Iran have capability of deterring or coping with regional
                            threats.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Shah said factor which had impressed him in economic projections was
                            that at present Iran's debt servicing is only around half of what its
                            debt servicing capacity can be. It was noted that present figure is 8.5
                            percent of foreign exchange receipts and that foreign repayments will
                            not rise to 12 percent level before end of next five year plan.</item>

                        <item>While reiterating points of concern, i.e. rising military budget and
                            inflationary pressures, I reported our conclusion that Iran's economic
                            progress is noteworthy and our conviction that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> officials will keep it healthy. Accordingly, President
                            has approved FY68 $50,000,000 credit tranche for military purchasing in
                            US. Added that virtually all this amount will go for second F–4
                            squadron.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Shah expressed appreciation. At same time, he called attention to
                            serious and rather urgent need for five additional F–5B's. Need arises
                            from fact that because of Vietnam demands <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> not providing extent of training previously provided.
                            He said he has 20 pilots training in Pakistan <pb n="375"
                                xml:id="pg_375" facs="0403"/>through T–38 level, but additional
                            F–5B's are necessary to train new pilots in gunnery and formation
                            flying. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>
                            indicated there may be small amount of money left in FY68 tranche after
                            F–4 squadron financed but it would not finance more than one or two
                            F–5B's. Shah said if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not prepared to
                            provide additional $3 to $5 million via credit arrangements, need is
                            such that he would be prepared to pay cash for those not fundable under
                            FY67 tranche.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Looking to future, Shah said by 1972 Iran would need replacement
                            equipment. He reiterated his determination to preserve his American
                            military orientation, particularly Air Force. He discussed possibility
                            of post-Vietnam rehab F–4 aircraft or F–5 follow-on aircraft which
                            Nor-throp now considering. I noted this was for future. Shah agreed but
                            pointed out that because of three to four year time lags Iran must get
                            in line. Main question was whether <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            is willing, as he hopes, to remain Iran's chief supplier. He noted in
                            this connection that he has more trouble assuring answer to this
                            question now when he is paying for equipment than previously when <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> supplied it via grant aid. There was
                            brief discussion few other military matters but they minor in nature.
                            They being reported via General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                                >Jablonsky</persName>'s usual channels.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Shah said he would appreciate my advice whether he should discuss his
                            military needs extensively while in Washington or whether they could be
                            handled adequately either via <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1"
                                >ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> here or via Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName>. Acknowledging that Shah
                            undoubtedly would be explaining his general thesis as to Iran's need for
                            adequate defense capability, I urged Shah not to get into discussion of
                            specific requirements.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>During course of discussion, I recalled President Johnson's letter of
                            last July<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">
                                <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> and the concern
                            therein expressed re Iran's dealing with Soviets in arms. This subject,
                            I noted, is very much in minds of many key Washington officials. This
                            launched Shah into lengthy rehearsal of rationale for relatively small
                            amount of Soviet military purchasing. He said Soviet Ambassador was in
                            previous day expressing hope that current arms deliveries would be
                            fore-runners of others. Shah gave us clear indication he does not intend
                            to get into any relationship of dependence on Soviets, noting
                            specifically how easily they could undermine him by cutting off
                            supplies.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Shah outlined his familiar thesis that Soviets have leapfrogged over
                            southern tier and for all intents and purposes have established base in
                            Egypt. That accomplished, Soviets, according to Shah, are now
                            maneuvering vis-a-vis Iran and Turkey. While it would be “odd,” Shah
                            said, to rebuff “smiles and friendship” entirely, he made clear he knows
                            Soviet game is to get Persian Gulf, i.e., Russia's “historic dream.”
                            This prompted inquiry from me why he is planning to let Soviets explore
                            for oil in Kermanshah <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0404"/>and
                            Shiraz areas. Shah reiterated what he had told U.K. Ambassador
                                <persName>Wright</persName> (Tehran 4574),<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d203fn4">Dated May 18. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                PET 17 U.S.S.R.-IRAN)</note> i.e., dividing Iran into spheres of
                            influence along lines of the 1907 treaty is unthinkable. I said steel
                            mill project is already in central Iran which should disabuse those who
                            might postulate spheres of influence theory. Shah noted Isfahan in 1907
                            treaty was considered in Soviet sphere of influence. In any case, he
                            said he does not expect substantial oil deposits to be found in Shiraz
                            area. Shah categorically said he would never let Soviets work in coastal
                            or offshore areas of Gulf where they would serve as “scouts” for
                            Nasser.</item>

                            homework re economic projections which Central Bank had produced. He was
                            conversant with various economic indicators. This in itself is in our

                    <p>The following were the substantive comments made during the conversation
                        which took place between the President and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> after the latter had presented his
                        credentials.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that Iran believed that the present crisis in the Near
                        East proved the correctness of Iran's analysis of the situation in the area.
                        Iran felt that it was necessary to resist aggressive forces. Iran counted on
                        continuing United States support for its efforts to promote stability in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>The President made no substantive response at this point but in a later
                        reference to the Near East crisis in connection with his appointment later
                        the same day with Foreign Minister <persName>Eban</persName> remarked that
                        the United States was trying very hard to find a “middle way” to solve the
                        present crisis. “If this could be done“, he said, “a catastrophe could be
                        avoided”. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> said he
                        believed a “middle way” would be the best way to solve the crisis.</p>
                    <p>The President, in a separate comment, remarked that he thought the world was
                        in the midst of a period of “testing”. Efforts were being made to get away
                        with acquiring additional territory. He felt it important that this be
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> referred to the
                        economic progress being made in Iran with special reference to the rate of
                        growth which he described as being exceeded only by Japan.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was looking forward to the visit of the Shah and
                        the Empress and that he would very much welcome any views which His Majesty
                        might have on the situation in the Near East.</p>

                    <p>During your visit to Paris, I recommend that you meet with the Shah to
                        discuss the Middle East crisis and specifically to increase his

                    </p>
                    <p>The current Arab/Israel crisis has had repercussions in Iran. At the same
                        time Nasser called for the evacuation of <gloss target="#t_UNEF1"
                            >UNEF</gloss>, he also publicly requested Jordan and Saudi Arabia to
                        intervene with the Shah to stop sales of Iranian oil to Israel. (Iranian oil
                        has been supplied to Israel since 1957 and has been carried by tanker around
                        the Arabian Peninsula through the Gulf of Aqaba to Eilat.)</p>
                    <p>In response, the Iranian Government issued an official denial that Iranian
                        oil was being sold to Israel. This is technically true, since the
                        transactions are made through third parties. At the same time, the Iranians
                        became concerned about their isolated position among the Islamic nations of
                        the Middle East and about the effects of Iran's ties with Israel on Iran's
                        efforts to establish closer relations with the moderate Arab states. On May
                        31, the Iranian Government issued a statement supporting “the legitimate
                        rights of Moslem peoples” and saying that it regards “as necessary the
                        securing of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people as mentioned in
                        the U.N. resolutions.” The statement also expressed the hope for a peaceful
                        solution to the present crisis. The Iranian press has from the first
                        attacked Nasser for instigating the crisis.</p>
                    <p>Iran's concern about its relations with the moderate Arab states has no doubt
                        been increased as a result of King <persName>Hussein</persName>'s flight to
                        Cairo to effect a grand reconciliation and to sign a military agreement with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. At this writing King
                            <persName>Faisal</persName> is still in Europe, but we do not exclude
                        the possibility that he, too, may in some manner make a gesture toward
                        improving his relations with Nasser in the name of Arab solidarity against
                        the Israel threat.</p>
                    <p>In their talks with us, Iranian officials have been expressing the hope that
                        we would take a firm line to keep the Gulf of Aqaba open. The Shah
                        undoubtedly believes that we bear much of the responsibility for the crisis
                        for not having acted vigorously to oppose Nasser long since. Some Iranian
                        officials have indicated a concern that we might resume aid to Nasser in
                        order to end the crisis.</p>

                                do so. He has again proven his ability as an expert, albeit a

                                day. He has been able to create <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379"

                            <item>For the past six months to a year, Nasser had been convincing
                                himself that the U.S. was determined to destroy him and to humiliate
                                Egypt. He viewed the cessation of significant U.S. aid to Egypt in
                                the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s growing economic crisis,

                                    <persName>Hussein</persName>, and even the good relations

                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Nasser, therefore, is trying to exploit the current crisis to his
                                advantage. He has consistently sought to identify publicly the U.S.
                                with Israel. He now believes he is in a position whereby the U.S.
                                and Israel face the painful choice of either accepting his “victory”
                                (withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>, closure of the
                                Straits of Tiran) or committing “aggression” against Egypt. He
                                strongly hopes for the former. He believes, however, that if he is
                                destroyed as a result of Israel/U.S. military action, he can destroy
                                with him a good many Western interests in the area. He considers
                                this a deterrent. There is some speculation that among Nasser's
                                objectives is the resumption of U.S. aid to the <gloss

                            <item>There is good reason to believe that the Soviets may have been
                                instrumental in touching off the present crisis by floating in
                                mid-May in Damascus and Cairo a report that a massive Israel attack
                                on Syria was imminent. Since then, they have attempted to reap full
                                propaganda advantage of the theme that Israel is the aggressor and
                                has U.S. support, that the Soviet Union is the protector of the
                                Arabs and that the Soviet Union hopes war can be avoided if only the
                                U.S. will restrain Israel. The Soviets seem to have been taken by
                                surprise by Nasser's proclaimed closure of the Gulf of Aqaba and
                                have thus far confined themselves to general statements in support
                                of the Arab position that the Straits lie in Egyptian territorial

                            <item>We certainly do not approve of <persName>Hussein</persName>'s
                                early public capitulation to Nasser. <persName>Hussein</persName> as
                                a sovereign independent ruler has to decide where his best interests
                                lie. He has assured us that this gesture was solely for the purpose
                                of insurance and that his attitude toward and intention to cooperate
                                with the United States is unchanged. Whether
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> will be able to maintain this
                                position under the pressure of events cannot be predicted with

                            <item>It would be helpful if the Shah were to let the Israelis know that
                                his attitude toward them is unchanged and that his intention is to
                                maintain the present relationship with them in all its aspects as
                                circumstances warrant. The Shah could also usefully counsel the

                                opportunity for multilateral diplomacy to work. We would hope that

                                the close relationship which Iran has with both countries. This
                                relationship is based on a mutuality of interests which continues to

                            <item>The U.S. position in this crisis has been made clear by the
                                President in his statement of May 23. The United States is firmly
                                committed to the support of the political independence and
                                territorial integrity of all the nations of the area. The United
                                States strongly opposes aggression by anyone in the area, in any

                                Aqaba to be an international waterway and feels that a blockade of

                                of peace. The United States is making vigorous efforts to obtain
                                effective United Nations action to resolve this crisis.

                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>The Shah of Iran and Queen <persName>Farah</persName> will arrive in
                        Washington on 12 June for a three-day official visit. Since his last visit
                        to the US in 1964, the Shah has been evolving a new foreign policy which
                        entails less reliance on the US and closer relations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe. The Shah remains
                        basically pro-US in outlook, but believes that it is advantageous for Iran
                        to broaden its sources of military equipment, economic credits, and trade.
                        He can be expected to press for a firm US policy against his bete noire,
                        Egyptian President <persName>Nasir</persName>, and to request more favorable
                            <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0409"/>treatment for Iran in the
                        extension of US military and economic credits. A proud and sensitive man,
                        the Shah will also be expecting recognition for his role as leader of a
                        country which is stable, achieving rapid economic growth, and undertaking
                        widespread social and economic reforms.</p>

                        <item>The Shah's new independence stems from many factors, but probably the
                            most significant is his growing conviction that the immediate threat to
                            Iranian security is posed not by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> but by the ambitions of Egyptian President
                                <persName>Nasir</persName>. He believes that
                                <persName>Nasir</persName> has designs on the Persian Gulf and on
                            the oil-rich Iranian province of Khuzestan, which has a large population
                            of ethnic Arabs (see map).<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">Not
                                reproduced.</note> Iranian security officials claim to have evidence
                            that the exiled <persName>Khuzestan</persName> (Arabistan) Liberation
                            Front receives encouragement and assistance from Egyptian intelligence.
                            The Shah can certainly be expected to point to the current Middle East
                            crisis as evidence of <persName>Nasir</persName>'s insatiable
                            ambitions.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Shah is also convinced that American officials have underestimated
                            the Egyptian threat to Iran and fears that the US would not support Iran
                            if a Nasirist campaign against him were to lead to hostilities. He was
                            severely shaken by the withholding of US arms from Pakistan during the
                            Indo-Pakistani conflict of 1965 and constantly points to this as
                            evidence that Iran must have other sources of arms and economic
                            assistance. He is determined to bolster his defenses in the Persian
                            Gulf, and is doing so with arms from a variety of sources.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>In economic terms the Shah is, of course, attracted by the low
                            interest rates charged by the Soviets and Eastern Europeans and by the
                            opportunity to repay Eastern military and economic credits with goods
                            rather than with foreign exchange. Last year's US-Iranian military
                            credit negotiations were marked by bitter Iranian complaints that US
                            terms were strictly commercial and took no note of Iran's position as a
                            good friend of the West.</item>

                        <item>The real turning point in Iranian-Soviet relations came in late 1965
                            when the Soviets extended Iran a credit of $289 million for building a
                            steel mill it had long desired. Part of this credit will be used for the
                            construction of a pipeline, through which will pass the Iranian natural
                            gas which the Soviets will accept as payment for the credit. Soviet
                            economic credits to Iran now total at least $346 million. Other projects
                            include construction of the Aras dam on the Iranian-U.S.S.R. border, an
                            electric power plant in Tabriz, improvement of Iranian ports on the
                            Caspian, <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0410"/>and Soviet prospecting
                            for oil in the Iranian offshore area of the Caspian Sea.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>During the first five months of 1967 the pace of Iran's rapprochement
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> increased. Early in the
                            year, Iran and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> signed a $540
                            million five-year trade agreement. Although this agreement probably will
                            not be completely fulfilled, it still will result in a significant
                            increase in trade. In April, Soviet Deputy Premier
                                <persName>Baybakov</persName> visited Teheran and apparently offered
                            the Iranians almost every conceivable type of economic assistance. The
                            communique issued at the close of Baybakov's visit mentioned industry,
                            communications, electric power, dam construction, irrigation, mining,
                            oil explorations, and metallurgy. It also mentioned increased shipments
                            of natural gas to the U.S.S.R. and the sale of Iranian oil. The
                            communiqué was only a “declaration of intent,” however, and in
                            negotiations on specific projects the Soviets tend not to be as generous
                            as their initial offers would indicate.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The most significant development of 1967 was the announcement in
                            January of a Soviet-Iranian arms deal, involving the extension of a
                            $110-million Soviet credit toward the purchase of armored personnel
                            carriers, antiaircraft weapons, and trucks. Arrangements were also made
                            for Soviet technicians and advisers to train Iranians in the use of the
                            equipment. This agreement, together with the purchase of UK naval
                            equipment and Tiger Cat missiles, has broken the virtual monopoly which
                            the US held over the supply and training of the Iranian armed
                            forces.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Shah also informed Western officials in May that he intended to
                            allow the Soviets to prospect for oil in areas in southern and western
                            Iran. The Soviets, however, may be reluctant to undertake expensive
                            prospecting in areas which the Western consortium was willing to give
                            up. Nevertheless, the Shah's willingness to permit a Soviet presence in
                            the southern oil region is indicative of the extent to which his
                            attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has changed.
                            It is also indicative of his determination to increase Iranian oil
                            production and of his disappointment with the record of the Western oil
                            consortium.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Eastern European countries have extended over $158 million in economic
                            credits to Iran—over $100 million of the credits is from Rumania and the
                            rest is from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland. Several new
                            trade agreements have been signed, and Iran has already agreed to sell
                            oil to Rumania and Bulgaria. The Shah was in Czechoslovakia in May; the
                            Czechs had previously indicated an interest in expanding Iran's
                            munitions production capability, and this possibility was undoubtedly
                            discussed.</item>

                            which he could for the first time decrease his dependence on the

                            indications that the government may loosen political restrictions
                            somewhat. The opposition Mardom Party may be permitted to win more
                            seats, the parties may have more leeway in the selection of candidates,
                            and two government-approved candidates may be permitted to run in some
                            constituencies. Nevertheless, the Shah is certainly not prepared to
                            allow outspoken opposition, and there is still no legitimate outlet for
                            the expression of antiregime sentiment.</item>

                            complete, and the program is now concentrating on farm mechanization and
                            the development of cooperatives. The health and literacy corps are
                            considered successful, although there is little information on the
                            impact of the programs on the average Iranian. All of these programs are
                            hampered to some degree by the lack of trained personnel.</item>

                            weakened by the reform and by the Iranian-U.S.S.R. rapprochement.
                            Conservative religious leaders continue to oppose aspects of the reform
                            program—such as increased rights for women—but apparently with little

                        <item>The Iranian economy is healthy, and all indications point to a rapid
                            growth rate at least for the next year. Last year's growth rate was
                            about nine percent, prices remained remarkably stable, public and
                            private investment increased, and oil revenues continued to rise. The
                            government has already taken steps to ease pressures on the balance of
                            payments. Iranian officials continue to believe that oil production is
                            not rising fast enough, and this could lead to further confrontations
                            with the Western oil consortium. A serious Iranian-consortium crisis was
                            narrowly averted last fall when the consortium agreed to step up
                            production, to relinquish 25 percent of its concession area to the
                            Iranian Government, and to make oil available for sale by Iran to
                            Eastern Europe.</item>

                                <persName>Farah</persName>. He has absolute faith in her loyalty,
                            and she has proved to be competent, popular, and actively interested in
                            the reform program.</item>

                        <item>Despite his new independence, the Shah remains a good friend of the
                            U.S.—he is one of the few third-world leaders who publicly supports the
                            U.S. policy in Vietnam. Iran is still heavily dependent on the West for
                            investment, trade, and military equipment. The Shah constantly insists
                            that his closer relations with the East will strengthen Iran, and will
                            thus make his country a better ally of the U.S. He claims to have no
                            illusions about the ultimate aims of the U.S.S.R., and his internal
                            security forces have been bolstered to maintain surveillance of the
                            growing number of Communist technicians and advisers in Iran. Recently,
                            the Iranian press undertook a campaign—obviously with government
                            approval—to put the rapprochement in “perspective.” The newspapers have
                            taken note of continued antigovernment broadcasts from Communist
                            clandestine radios, past Soviet perfidy, and the dangers of accepting
                            the Soviet embrace too enthusiastically.</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>Nevertheless, the danger remains that the Shah will overestimate his
                            capability to control the increased Soviet presence in Iran. He has said
                            several times recently, with some overconfidence, that Soviet
                            “dependence” on Iranian natural gas will give Iran significant leverage
                            over Soviet policy in the Middle East, a doubtful analysis at best. The
                            possibility also exists that, in the event of the Shah's demise, the
                            U.S.S.R. would be in a better position to influence the course of
                            events.</item>

                        For the President and the Secretary of State from <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>. I had a long talk alone with Shah
                        at noon today, interrupted only by news despatches of Arab-Israel <pb
                            n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>fighting. I gave him <gloss
                            target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> despatch from Moscow to the effect that
                        Russian position would depend on that taken by the US, which he said was
                        most important.</p>
                    <p>The Shah listened to my explanation of our attempts to restrain Israel and
                        Arabs, possible Soviet encouragement of Damascus and Cairo belligerence, but
                        our belief Soviets did not now want military action and their surprise over
                        Nasser's closing of Gulf of Aqaba. Furthermore, the President believed
                        Shah's interest was to remain as aloof as possible without interruption oil
                        shipments and that he hoped Shah would use his influence, particularly with
                        Faisal. I said the President would be most interested in getting the Shah's
                        opinions and judgment.</p>
                    <p>He replied that perhaps we should not talk about the past, but only the
                        future. On the other hand, we must learn from past mistakes. He went over
                        the familiar ground of our assisting Nasser, not accepting the inevitability
                        of his aggressive policies. We had missed opportunity to stop Nasser over
                        other issues in the past, over Yemen, and such outrageous actions as use of
                        gas. Now things were difficult since on the issue of conflict with Israel
                        all Arabs would be united. His Ambassador had seen
                            <persName>Faisal</persName> who, although concerned over Nasser and
                        other issues, stated he would give full support to Nasser against
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>He reported that Soviet Ambassador had called on him this morning. Ambassador
                        stated that hostilities should be stopped, and in this the French might be
                        useful. Security Council action should be sought.</p>
                    <p>The Shah emphasized several times that the long range problem was how to stop
                        Nasser in future. Some other issue than Israel must be found. Although he
                        continued to consider Nasser a dangerous and aggressive dictator, interested
                        only in his aggrandizement, the Shah could not oppose a Moslem cause. He
                        would, therefore, have to give “lip service” support, specifically referring
                        to earlier <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions. The Shah suggested
                        we should give the impression we wanted to stop the fighting, but implied
                        that he hoped Nasser's forces would be humiliated. He considered our long
                        range major objective was “how Nasser could be destroyed”.</p>
                    <p>Although he looked forward keenly to seeing the President in Washington, he
                        feels he probably must return home as his people would not understand his
                        traveling in Paris and visiting the fair in Canada.</p>
                    <p>He rehearsed again, as he had done when I saw him last November, his belief
                        that Iran must be militarily strong enough to deal with Nasser and Iraq
                        without US intervention. He again expressed regret that we had not done more
                        to strengthen Iran militarily, referring particularly to our extensive aid
                        to Turkey.</p>
                    <p>I of course went over the familiar ground of Turkey's <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership, etc.</p>
                    <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0414"/>
                    <p>He seemed relieved when I offered to call on him tomorrow if there were any
                        further developments of importance, and when I told him that I felt sure we
                        would continue to consult him closely, he repeated necessity that he must
                        give lip service to Moslem solidarity, but his primary concern was how
                        Nasser's influence could be reduced and eventually destroyed. Otherwise,
                        there could be no peace in the Middle East. He indicated that currently oil
                        shipments would continue without interruption as normal commercial
                        transactions, and that he would in other ways attempt to calm situation.</p>
                    <p>Please instruct if any reason for me to see Shah again tomorrow morning.<note

                            Gaulle</persName> is heading in Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Shah expressed earnest desire to continue close exchange of views on
                        developments. He believes Nasser's claim of intervention by US and British
                        planes is to have future basis that his forces were not defeated by Israel
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>The Shah hopes the Soviets will not intervene militarily on pretext to offset
                        U.S. action. I told him that our contacts with Soviet Government led us to
                        believe Soviets would not intervene and had indicated that all should work
                        for cease-fire and return to old positions. I also said we understand Israel
                        had no territorial ambitions, only assurance of free passage to Gulf of
                        Aqaba.</p>
                    <p>Shah urged that we should now consider long range problem of Nasser. We could
                        not tolerate flare-ups every few years. He said Nasser's aggressive plans
                        must be stopped.</p>
                    <p>Shah raised question of his initiative regarding Vietnam which I will report

                            <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Theodore L. Eliot</persName>, Jr., Country
                            Director for Iran, <gloss target="#t_NEAIRN1">NEA/IRN</gloss>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> began by expressing
                        concern about demonstrations in the Arab countries against American citizens
                        and installations. The Secretary referred to malicious and false reports
                        that American planes participated in the Israeli attacks. He said that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> knows where our carriers are; Soviet
                        destroyers are in their area. But such reports incite Arab mobs.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador mentioned that there have been reports that the Kuwaitis and
                        Iraqis have stopped the flow of oil.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it is important for as many countries as possible to
                        remain detached. What is involved is the Jehad psychology on one side and
                        the apocalyptic psychology on the other. Mob pressures in the Arab countries
                        make it impossible for Arab governments to be detached. Hopefully, some of
                        them will be able to draw a distinction between what they say and what they
                        do. We are pleased that Israel has said it has no territorial ambitions.
                        Nasser is riding a tiger; it is difficult to see how he can disengage from a
                        holy war which cannot succeed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> commented that the
                        ill effects of the war are likely to last for some time. Iran, which values
                        its progress and stability, is quite concerned and hopes for a
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we want His Majesty to understand that the United States
                        was not involved in the outbreak of hostilities. We had received commitments
                        from both sides not to attack. We had no advance notice from either side. We
                        are making no judgment as to who started the fighting. Our advice to all
                        capitals concerned was to give the Security Council and diplomatic efforts a
                        chance to find an answer.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the Israelis had apparently felt that time was
                        running out for them. The Secretary replied they had been touchy as far as
                        the military problem was concerned. They had had a report of 400 Egyptian
                        tanks moving on Elath. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1"
                            >Ansary</persName> commented that <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389"
                            facs="0417"/>they were also concerned about the Egyptian Vice President
                        coming to Washington. The Secretary replied that we have had no such
                        information from the Israelis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then reviewed the history over the past 10 years of our support
                        for the integrity of the states of the area, mentioning support we had given
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Algeria,
                        Kuwait, Tunisia and Morocco. We have had a consistent and even-handed
                        interest in protecting the integrity of the states of the area. All this is
                        forgotten when the issue is Arabs against Israel.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> said that it was too
                        bad that the Yemen problem had not been solved. The Secretary, mentioning
                        the use of gas by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, said that
                        Nasser's attitude toward the Yemen was not in accordance with usual
                        standards of conduct.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked if the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> would get together on a resolution in the Security
                        Council. The Secretary said that we may get together on a resolution, but
                        that the resolution might be a complicated one which would mean different
                        things to different people and hence might be the beginning rather than the
                        end of a problem. He stressed that we could not persuade Israel to go back
                        to the status quo before June 5. The Israelis have made clear that closing
                        the Straits of Tiran was a casus belli. What is involved for the United
                        States is not only the general principle of freedom of an international
                        waterway but also the fact that in 1957 we persuaded Israel to withdraw from
                        the Sinai peninsula on the condition that there would be freedom of passage
                        through the straits. We cannot forget such a commitment.</p>

                                a cutoff of oil supplies by the oil producing Arab countries,
                                thereby shifting the confrontation on to other shoulders.</item>

                    <p>“I very much appreciate the kind letter you sent me from Paris.<note n="2"

                        convenient for you to come to Washington.”</p>

                    <p>“Meanwhile, Your Majesty, I assure you that in these troubled times I deeply

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> has informed me

                        Israel have accepted a cease-fire. I would greatly welcome your thoughts as

                                it would seem premature to send a special U.S. representative to

                                a special representative to Washington, U.S. officials would be
                                happy to meet with him if there were no publicity and he realized

                                    against others if not so effectively blunted by Israelis. Nasser
                                    remains an evil force and must someday be destroyed. Yet he had
                                    been allowed go on too long unchallenged, throwing gas bombs in
                                    Yemen and carrying out other nefarious doings. Arab arrogance
                                    and aggressiveness repugnant to Iran. Arabs made much of their
                                    long subjection to foreign rule, excuse they constantly draw on
                                    to explain their own lack of accomplishments in health,
                                    education, etc., whereas real responsibility for lack of
                                    progress lay with area countries themselves. If they had
                                    actually wanted education, they could have had it, and likewise
                                    in other fields about which they now complain. In this
                                    atmosphere Communists have been provided with fertile ground for

                                    their “arrogant” attitudes: “Mouth of General
                                        <persName>Dayan</persName> should be closed.” Israelis
                                    should be taking line that they merely trying to defend their
                                    security and rights. They should be emphasizing simple desire
                                    live in peace enjoying security. Instead Israeli spokesmen
                                    taking strong positions all over place, annexing Jerusalem,
                                    affirming their desires for this and that, proposals obviously

                                is security (requirement which Shah readily acknowledged). Hare said

                                    Pakistan. Talk turned to <persName>Tito</persName>'s role with

                                        <persName>Tito</persName>'s strident support of Nasser.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> said this
                                    explainable perhaps in terms evolving internal political
                                    patterns with growth “new” guard chafing at dominance of

                                    suggested there perhaps some connection between

                                    recent events in Greece. Shah said he did not know the Greek
                                    Junta but felt they had done job which had to be accomplished;
                                    otherwise Papandreou like Mossedegh would have thrown country

                            of Iran's military and economic agreements with the Soviet Union and its

                        assure him on my behalf that the Senatorial views expressed do not represent
                        views of executive branch. As the Shah is undoubtedly aware, entire subject
                        US military assistance and sales programs is currently being intensely
                        reviewed by Congress, and Senatorial barbs are aimed at executive branch and
                        not at Iran. You may assure him that we do not like these barbs either. More
                        important, you may assure him that these barbs have in no way diminished the
                        esteem in which we hold the Shah and that we continue to look forward with
                        great pleasure to his forthcoming visit. Our esteem for him and our desire
                        to welcome him to Washington and to seek his counsel have increased in
                        recent weeks as a result of our deep appreciation for Iran's constructive

                            to discussions which will take place. He gratified by what he considers
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s friendly attitude toward Iran
                            and even looks forward to talking with “those Senators.”</item>

                            criticisms such as those by Senators can be taken in stride. Comment: We
                            hope such equilibrium obtains after story breaks. In any case, he has
                            been favorably conditioned thanks to Dept's foresight in alerting us and

                            covered in discussions at top levels. However, Thursday morning might be
                            left open for Mideast experts briefing, final decision to be made after

                        <item>Shah indicated again that he hopes to discuss food problems. Delighted
                            that Iran has unusually good wheat crop this year, he wants to
                            concentrate with American help on increased food production in years
                            ahead as contribution to major problems facing world during rest of this
                            century. Shah noted with keen disappointment that <persName>Bill

                                <persName>Khuzestan</persName> has now been scaled down to 5,000
                            acres when Shah wishes major commercial project of one or more hundred

                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Shah also indicated he will wish to discuss importance of Iran's
                            maintaining adequate defense capability so that if troubles break out in
                            this region American boys will not be shot a la Viet Nam. He said he
                            thinks our countries owe it to each other to let each other know where
                            we stand and implied that Iran will purchase elsewhere to the extent

                        <item>In discussing August 2nd his forthcoming trip to Washington, Shah
                            stressed that he considers it a “working visit in depth.” He is pleased
                            that program provides wide range of opportunities for talks with <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> leaders.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Once again Shah stressed his interest in agriculture. He said that at
                            pace Iran is going now, even though it has almost self-sufficient supply
                            of food this year, full development of Iran's resources will take
                            another century. What is needed, he said, is large-scale commercial
                            farming of hundred thousand acres or more and only US has know-how for
                            this. He mentioned not only <persName>Khuzistan</persName>, but also
                            Jiroft area (where <persName>Kim Roosevelt</persName>'s project has
                            uncovered abundant water supplies), <persName>Sistan Basin</persName>,
                            and <persName>Gorgan</persName> where real successes been scored this
                            year with American hybrid corn.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Linked with agriculture is Shah's interest in desalination. He wishes
                            to push forward in this field pursuant to talks which Minister of
                                <persName>Water Rouhani</persName> has had with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> and other well-disposed
                            Department of Interior officials.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>One of most important purposes of Shah's visit will be to get
                            reassurance that we intend to continue our cooperation in military
                            field. Although he will probably not go into detail in his talk with the
                            President (and did not mention such details in the August 2 interview),
                            we know that his greatest interest is in the following, which he will
                            hope to discuss at least in general terms during his Washington visit:
                            (a) filling gaps caused by attrition and other insufficiencies in our
                            jointly agreed program; and (b) planning four and five years ahead in
                            Iran's defense program. Re latter, he will be interested in: (c)
                            possible re-hab F–4's; (d) possible follow-on plane(s) to F–5 (he has
                            appointment with Northrop official); (e) Sheridan tanks; (f) helicopters
                            to make his military mobile enough to counter Viet Nam-type guerrilla
                            activities which are Iran's most likely threat; and (g) communications
                            to assure command control. In this connection, I am pleased that <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is suggesting <gloss

                        <item>Shah indicates he will also wish to make known in Washington his views
                            that since Iran is most stable and trustworthy state in Mideast, Western
                            oil companies should assure that high level of present liftings be <pb

                            increased. He sees no reason why Arab producers should be allowed to
                            blackball certain markets and still retain production levels higher than
                            Iran.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Obviously of major interest will be exchange of views between Shah and
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials re Mideast situation.
                            Shah is proud that Iran is almost a model of progress and constructivism
                            in this part of world and he ready to play whatever role is feasible in
                            encouraging similar state of affairs in Arab world. He remains
                            convinced, however, that until Nasserism is checked, as in Yemen, there
                            is little hope for progress in Arab world.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Since my departure for Washington is only one week away, Shah and I
                            agreed that unless he or Washington had something special to discuss
                            before my departure we would tidy up any loose ends re his trip via
                            either Court or Foreign Ministers.</item>

                        <item>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Shah shared my view that on eve of his
                            Washington visit US-Iran relations are as warm and healthy as they have
                            ever been. There is in Embassy's view, however, a dark cloud on horizon,
                            i.e., Senatorial action already taken blocking concessionary credit and
                            sales by <persName corresp="#p_KHJ1">Henry Kuss</persName>' department
                            in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. During our last audience Shah
                            made clear he feels entitled to know where he stands re military
                            supplies from US in future. In August 2nd discussion he pointed out
                            Soviets continue to pump in arms to Iran's potential enemies and at much
                            lower prices and two and half percent interest rate. While we sure he
                            will avoid over-dependence on Soviets, we also sure that if <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is unresponsive to his future military
                            needs Shah will without question turn to French, U.K., <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and other suppliers. Embassy has
                            consistently favored some diversification in Iran's military
                            procurement, but we see present situation as somewhat of a crossroads.
                            If we abdicate role of principal supplier, it will be a severe setback
                            to present healthy relationship which we believe can be retained at
                            small cost both financially and even arms-wise. While such setback in
                            itself will not be fatal, we wonder if <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> really wishes to alienate such a staunch friend and at
                            same time surrender concomitant benefits we have here, notably our

                            been apprised of Senatorial concerns. We would like to think that via
                            personal testimony he can play a key role in assuring that Iran-US

                    <p>The Shah has suggested to us that he might attempt to establish a new
                        mechanism for arriving at a peaceful solution of the Vietnamese war. He has
                        been thinking of bringing together a group of countries, such as Iran,
                        Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Japan and Cambodia, which would have access to
                        the United States, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist
                        China and might open new doors for discussions of a possible solution. Such
                        a group would work discreetly and not make public proposals. The Shah may
                        again raise this idea in his discussions with you.</p>
                    <p>We have told the Shah that we deeply appreciate his interest and concern and
                        that we are interested in any effort by any government or group of
                        governments to help achieve a peaceful solution. We have indicated that if
                        the governments the Shah has in mind agree that such an effort would be
                        worthwhile and if the effort would be discreet, we would be openhanded and
                        frank in dealing with such a group. We have stressed that explicit approval
                        by us of such an effort would be a kiss of death.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Our military relationship with Iran is fundamental to our overall
                        relationship, and the Shah will be seeking, during his August visit, a
                        reaffirmation of our desire to continue the close military relationship we
                        have had in the past. Although he is clearly determined to move away from
                        his former complete dependence on us for military assistance, there is no
                        sign that he wishes seriously to disturb the fundamentals of his security
                        relationship with the United States. Despite recent Iranian purchases from
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, the influential position which the U.S. has achieved with
                        the Iranian military establishment will continue as long as we are able to
                        continue our military assistance, sales and related advisory programs. Since
                        the inception of our military assistance to Iran in 1954, we have programmed
                        military equipment and services totaling more than $790 million for Iran's
                        armed forces. We have also conditionally agreed to extend Iran credits up to
                        a total of $400 million for military equipment and services during <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965–70. Credit agreements for $300 million
                        have already been signed and the funds earmarked for specific purchases. Our
                        grant military assistance continues on a reduced scale. During his visit,
                        the Shah is likely to express a desire to obtain additional equipment and
                        advisory assistance and to indicate that Iran's security needs will be met
                        by purchases from other sources if the U.S. is unable to respond favorably
                        to his requests for assistance.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>U.S. military assistance policy toward Iran has evolved significantly during
                        the past few years. Prior to 1964, all U.S. military equipment and services
                        were provided Iran on a grant basis; since that time, Iran has undertaken to
                        pay for an increasingly large portion of its defense needs, and we
                        anticipate that by 1970 the U.S. grant program in Iran will concentrate on
                        training and support unless overriding political exigencies require grant
                        materiel aid.</p>
                    <p>The impetus for Iran's present military purchase policy was composed of
                        several factors: 1) the fact that U.S. grant military assistance has <pb
                            n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0431"/>been provided exclusively to meet
                        the Soviet threat and not that from other directions which the Shah believes
                        to be more imminent; 2) the Shah's conviction that the principal short-term
                        danger to his country lies in Nasserist Arab ambitions in the oil-rich
                        Persian Gulf area (see separate Background Paper);<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d220fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> 3) Iran's growing foreign
                        exchange revenues from oil which now exceed $600 million annually.</p>
                    <p>Increasingly worried over the radical Arab threat, the Shah approached us in
                        early 1964 with a proposal to make large-scale military purchases estimated
                        at more than $450 million. We were concerned that purchases of this
                        magnitude might seriously impair Iran's economic development program. We
                        eventually persuaded the Shah that a credit of $200 million over a 5-year
                        period would meet Iran's needs. A Memorandum of Understanding covering this
                        $200 million credit, and also extending the U.S. grant aid commitment
                        through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969, was signed on July 4,
                            1964.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">See <ref target="#d47">Document
                                47</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In November 1965, the Shah pressed us for additional credits. A U.S. military
                        survey team was dispatched to reassess the threat to Iran, and we agreed in
                        August 1966 to amend the earlier Memorandum of Understanding so as to make
                        available an additional $200 million for military purchases over the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967–70 period.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4"
                            >See <ref target="#d171">Document 171</ref>.</note> The new credit was
                        subject to release in four annual increments of $50 million each, with
                        approval of each increment to be made by the President after a thorough
                        review of Iran's economy to ensure that extension of each credit increment
                        would not impair the economic development of the country.</p>
                    <p>Under the Agreement as amended, Iran is buying two squadrons (32 aircraft) of
                        F–4–D interceptors to complement the six squadrons of F–5 fighters provided
                        under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, 460 M–60-Al medium tanks to
                        modernize Iran's armored division, an air control and warning system to
                        protect Iran's oil-rich southwestern region against possible aggression,
                        C–130–E transport aircraft to enhance armed forces mobility and a 60-day war
                        reserve of ammunition.</p>
                    <p>Our long-term agreement and the virtually exclusive military advisory
                        relationship provided through ARMISH–MAAG should ensure our remaining the
                        primary foreign military influence in Iran if we can continue to provide
                        advisory services and credit on an attractive basis for military sales. We
                        are not trying, however, to sustain a position as exclusive supplier of
                        military equipment. Last year, Iran ordered some $60 million worth of
                        short-range missiles and naval craft from Britain, and in February 1967 the
                        Iranian Government announced a $110 million barter agreement with the <gloss

                        armored reconnaissance vehicles, transport aircraft, helicopters, a
                        follow-on fighter to the F–5 being provided under <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> and, perhaps, rehabilitated F–4 interceptors late in the
                        planning period. The Shah has not broached the issue of additional credits.
                        In view of the continuing increase in Iran's foreign exchange earnings from
                        oil and Iran's probable equipment modernization needs, however, he may well
                        seek an extension of present credit levels into the 1970's, perhaps coupled
                        with an increase in credit availabilities in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1968–70.</p>
                    <p>The Shah has also indicated that he may request more U.S. advisors to assist
                        his Air Force as increasingly complex systems (e.g., F–4D interceptors and
                        an Air Control and Warning System along the Persian Gulf) are introduced. We
                        are not certain as to just what the Shah has in mind, but he may be thinking
                        in terms of U.S. personnel performing actual maintenance on the new
                        materiel. The U.S. Army Mission/Military Assistance Advisory Group (<gloss
                            target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1">ARMISH/MAAG</gloss>) has increased its advisory
                        effort with the Iranian Air Force and plans to devote an increasing
                        proportion of its efforts to this area as these systems are introduced. If
                        the Iranians are interested in direct support, they should be encouraged to
                        purchase it from U.S. industry or from U.S. technical advisory groups. The
                        Military Assistance Program is not intended to perform direct support for
                        foreign forces, and a personnel augmentation for this purpose would be
                        extremely difficult, if not impossible, to justify before Congress.
                        Therefore we should urge him to expedite the training of Iranians for such
                        functions and to consider selective purchasing from U.S. sources of
                        personnel services if necessary to complement Iranian efforts.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Political</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The internal Iranian political scene has not been as stable as it is today
                        since World War II. The Shah is firmly in control of the government and is
                        in the forefront of the drive to modernize the country. His programs for
                        economic development, land reform, health and education and many other
                        improvements have engaged the cooperation of most Iranians and have outdone
                        the slogans and proposals of the opposition to his rule. Economic growth is
                        creating jobs and investment opportunities and helping to build a middle
                        class with a vested interest in stability. Aside from having the wind taken
                        out of its sails by the Shah's programs, the opposition is divided and
                        impotent.</p>
                    <p>The Shah's regime is still dependent in the final analysis on the security
                        forces which he commands, and the opposition is still strictly controlled.
                        But, except for a few minor incidents, there have been no demonstrations or
                        attempts at armed insurrection against the regime since 1963. The Shah's
                        reform programs and the growing economy are enlisting the energies of
                        numerous former opposition leaders.</p>
                    <p>Parliamentary elections were held on August 4, 1967. Although there were
                        efforts to create an appearance of competition among approved pro-regime
                        candidates, the elections were firmly controlled and directed from the
                        Palace. The new parliament can be expected to be completely responsive to
                        the Shah's guidance.</p>
                    <p>The principal weakness in the Iranian political scene remains its dependence
                        on one man. But the chances for longer term stability, should the Shah
                        suddenly disappear from the scene, are increasing as more Iranians obtain a
                        stake in stability. Although the establishment of democratic institutions as
                        we know them is still a long time off in Iran, the government is relying
                        increasingly on Iran's best trained people as its administrators, and the
                        Shah seeks advice from a broad spectrum of Iranian life. The Shah has also
                        recently decided to establish better procedures for <pb n="406"
                            xml:id="pg_406" facs="0434"/>a regency should he die before his
                        6-year-old son reaches maturity. Finally, even many Iranians who oppose the
                        regime can conceive of no viable alternative.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Shah and his government are proud of Iran's economic and social progress
                        and their economic development plans for the future. The government's annual
                        growth target of 6% for <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> has been well
                        exceeded in the past two years, with relative price stability being
                        maintained in this period. The prospects for the current year again indicate
                        a growth rate of 7–8%. The rate of population growth is estimated to be 3%.
                        Annual per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> is about $230.</p>
                    <p>Oil revenues finance the greater part of the government's development
                        expenditures. The Fourth Plan, which begins in 1968, will establish
                        priorities in favor of industry and agriculture with less emphasis on
                        infrastructure to which considerable resources have already been devoted.
                        Private industrial investment is increasing steadily.</p>
                    <p>Iran's capital investment programs have thus far been carried out with only
                        moderate reliance upon foreign capital. This situation is changing rapidly,
                        however, with official foreign credits as well as foreign private investment
                        steadily increasing. Iran's credit-worthiness has continued to improve, and
                        there appears to be no question that further borrowing on conventional terms
                        will be feasible in the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>Annual oil income amounting to over $600 million accounts for approximately
                        three-fourths of Iran's total foreign exchange earnings and about one-half
                        of total government revenues. Although the current outlook indicates there
                        will be continued pressure upon the balance of payments, the long-term
                        foreign exchange prospect is favorable in the light of increasing oil
                        revenues and exports of petrochemicals and natural gas, greater import
                        substitution in manufactured goods, and the government's demonstrated
                        capacity to impose fiscal and import restraints as well as to borrow and
                        usefully absorb greater amounts of foreign capital.</p>
                    <p>Despite increasing urbanization, the importance of its oil resources and the
                        growth of new industries, Iran's economy is still essentially agrarian. The
                        agricultural sector supports two-thirds of the population and provides
                        nearly one-third of gross domestic product and <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Land reform has been the cornerstone of the Shah's “White Revolution” and
                        since 1962 the government has made substantial progress in dismantling a
                        feudal land-holding system and extending new ownership and farming rights to
                        villagers throughout the country. This has been accomplished with minimal
                        resistance and without impairing agricultural production. The final phase of
                        land reform now underway is aimed at boosting output and expanding local
                        cooperatives. Further <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0435"/>progress will
                        depend heavily upon the ability of the government to mobilize additional
                        capital, extension services and local leadership. This key reform effort has
                        been successfully complemented by an imaginative use of military conscripts
                        serving throughout rural Iran in separate literacy, health and development
                        corps. For example, four years ago only 8% of the rural population received
                        any exposure to rudimentary education. The figure is now 20% and rising.</p>

                    <p>Several hundred of the Iranian students in the United States are ardently and
                        volubly opposed to the Shah. Dissidents, working principally through the
                        Iranian Students Association, have for many years carried on an intermittent
                        campaign of protest against the Shah's regime and have succeeded during
                        previous visits by the Shah in provoking public incidents insulting to the
                        Shah. They have also enlisted American civil liberties groups and
                        “ultra-liberals” in publicizing accounts—some factual and some distorted—of
                        restraints on personal liberty in Iran. These activities have caused
                        continuous irritation in our diplomatic relations with the Shah and his
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Iranian officials know the limitations on our ability to restrain these
                        anti-Shah activities so long as the Iranian dissidents do not violate U.S.
                        laws. They also know that we have exerted extraordinary efforts to bring to
                        justice or to deport such agitators wherever there is a legal basis for
                        doing so. Fortunately, the number of irritating cases has been on the
                        decline in recent months, but we cannot be sanguine about the prospects for
                            <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0436"/>avoiding altogether some

                    </p>
                    <p>A spectacular irritant in our relations with the Shah arose out of the
                        activities of an Iranian promoter, Khaibar Gudarzian. “<persName>Khaibar
                            Khan</persName>,” as he calls himself, three years ago published a
                        sensational set of allegations of multi-million-dollar embezzlement
                        including charges against members of the Shah's family and involving <gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> activities in Iran. The allegations were
                        repudiated by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MCJL1">McClellan</persName>
                        after detailed inquiry conducted by the Senate Committee on Government
                        Operations. Gudarzian nevertheless succeeded in tying up substantial bank
                        accounts of the Shah's brother and sister for many months until a Federal
                        District Court ruled against Gudarzian last autumn. Gudarzian's appeal to
                        the U.S. Court of Appeals was rejected and his suit against the Prince and
                        Princess has apparently been dropped.</p>
                    <p>The Justice Department has continued to review the possibility of criminal
                        prosecution against Gudarzian. At the present time, however, Justice does
                        not believe that any of the possible charges can be pressed successfully due
                        to a variety of legal technicalities. The Department of Justice is
                        continuing, however, to evaluate the case and will take action if it appears
                        that an opportunity is presented.</p>
                    <p>Our immigration authorities have confirmed that Gudarzian is “out of status”
                        and they have initiated proceedings designed to effect his deportation. This
                        can be a lengthy process, taking a year or more, but the matter will be
                        pressed as rapidly as administratively feasible.</p>

                                <item>Aside from the perennial subject of demonstrations by Iranian
                                    students in U.S., etc., the 15 August meeting with the Shah was
                                    standard friendly affair and something of a rehearsal for
                                    upcoming visit to the United States. He obviously looking
                                    forward to meeting with the President for whom he expressed
                                    sympathy and understanding re heavy burden he carries as U.S.
                                    top government executive. This after stating he fully understood
                                    legislative opportunism and possible irresponsible public
                                    performance. Noted however that Export/Import Bank action turned
                                    out favorably. In regard to arms he claims to be relaxed,
                                    stating he will make his case and if U.S. Government is
                                    interested, as they should be, so much the better; if not, he
                                    will make other arrangements. No hard feelings—recriminations,
                                    etc. He hopeful that at least Air Force support will be
                                    forthcoming and that sufficient Air advisors will be available,
                                    preferably out of uniform.</item>

                                <item>In summary, we found the Shah relaxed, confident, pleased with
                                    his economic successes at home (which he should be) and looking
                                    forward to his visit. His story will be that he is offering the
                                    cooperation of the only responsible modern progressive country
                                    in the area. While he not working against <gloss
                                        target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, which he views as
                                    ineffective, but not bad, the regional cooperation for
                                    development is more the answer to regional requirements. While
                                    most friendly and bland about all of this, we nevertheless
                                    estimate that if visit with the President not productive, he
                                    will undoubtedly come away with a less friendly attitude than he
                                    now professes. What the Shah really wants from the United States
                                    Government is recognition as a responsible area leader and, of
                                    course, that undefined material something that goes with this
                                    recognition.</item>

                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>The Shah of Iran will arrive in Washington on 22 August for a brief official
                        visit. His visit was originally scheduled for 12 June but was postponed when
                        the Arab-Israeli war broke out. Although Iran publicly voiced support for
                        the Arab cause, Iran's ties with Israel were not affected and most Iranian
                        officials were privately delighted by <persName>Nasir</persName>'s
                        humiliating defeat.</p>
                    <p>The Shah has not modified his conviction that the Egyptian president poses
                        the most serious long-range threat to Iranian security, and he will continue
                        to press for favorable prices and terms on US military equipment to bolster
                        his defenses in the Persian Gulf. Staunch Soviet support for Egypt and other
                        radical Arab states appears to have resulted in a note of caution in
                        Soviet-Iranian relations, and rapprochement is likely to proceed at a
                        reduced pace.</p>

                    <p>The main purpose of your meeting is once again to reassure the Shah that you
                        regard him highly and believe the U.S. has a stake in the success of his
                        kind of reform. But as you know, he is a thoughtful man and is looking
                        forward to serious talk. He will be flattered by any confidences you can
                        share on your talks with <persName>Kosygin</persName>, your thoughts on
                        Vietnam, your interest in <persName>Ayub</persName>, your feelings about the
                        Middle East, and even your analysis of our own urban problems.</p>
                    <p>The new factor in the U.S.-Iran equation since his 1964 visit is his
                        increasing independence. After long dependence on U.S. aid and years of
                        feeling that only the U.S. could protect him against Nasser and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Shah for better than two years has
                        been feeling his way toward a more independent policy.</p>
                    <p>No one cause prompted this shift. Our cutoff of military supply to
                            <persName>Ayub</persName> during the Indo-Pak war upset him. He has
                        watched the changing temperature of U.S.-Soviet relations, which has made
                        him re-think his own relations with Moscow. Domestic pressures have forced
                        him to appear less “the American puppet,” especially as Iran becomes

                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He has strengthened his relations with
                        Pakistan and Turkey. He has supported the Yemeni Royalists and elements in
                        South Arabia working against Nasser. He has—almost alone among the Moslem
                        states—maintained a respectable relationship with Israel.</p>
                    <p>He is still feeling his way, and you may want to talk over the pitfalls in
                        going too fast with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviet
                        role in the Middle East war has probably given him second thoughts, but your
                        own experience with Kosygin might help him sort out the limits of working
                        with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The other side of this coin for him is how heavily he can count on us for
                        future arms supply. Under the current Memorandum of Understanding we are
                        committed to provide another $100 million in credit sales. <pb n="413"

                        stands, we would be able to meet that obligation if you told
                            <persName>Harold Linder</persName> to make the loan without a Defense
                        guarantee. But the Shah probably assumes that; his main interest is whether
                        we will go on supplying him beyond the term of the current understanding
                        (1970). While you can say that politically we want a continuing military
                        relationship, we'll just have to wait to see where we stand with Congress.
                        You may want to discuss your Congressional problem with him, since he will
                        be seeing quite a few members of Congress.</p>
                    <p>More broadly, he will want to know what role we intend to play in the Middle
                        East. One way to explain our position is to say, as you have in the past,
                        that we don't walk out on friends, so we're not about to disengage. But then
                        you might go on to describe the new spirit of regionalism you found on your
                        Pacific trip and your hope that something similar might emerge in the Middle
                        East. While we don't want to commission him for any special job, we do feel
                        he could play an important role in making this happen.</p>
                    <p>After stating your views, you might be interested to hear from the Shah what
                        role he thinks we can play in the area in the future. A number of our
                        moderate friends tell us frantically that we must do something to preserve
                        the anti-Communist balance in the Middle East, but when we get down to
                        specifics they have little to suggest.</p>
                    <p>Because of your own personal interest, you will undoubtedly want to hear from
                        the Shah himself about the progress of his reform program. Although <gloss

                        next year, more and more American businessmen are moving into Iran and it
                        might be interesting to ask the Shah how, without a formal aid program, he
                        thinks we can participate constructively.</p>
                    <p>You will want to read Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s

                    <p>I am puzzled by one line of your memorandum to the President of August 15 on
                        his meetings with the Shah.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">
                            <ref target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> In paragraph 4, among the
                        topics for the President to discuss with the Shah is listed: “Soviet-Iranian
                        military deals confuse our public and Congress.”</p>
                    <p>I wonder if this is a matter which the President would wish to raise since we
                        are not presently in a good position to give the Shah any encouragement on
                        more credit purchases of military equipment in the United States.</p>
                    <p>I understand the Shah has given us assurances Iran will not purchase
                        “sophisticated” military equipment from the Soviet Union. In addition, Iran
                        is paying for this equipment through natural gas sales.</p>
                    <p>It is certainly true that <persName>Symington</persName> and certain other
                        Senators have expressed disapproval of the Soviet arms deal (partly because
                        they were not informed in advance), but for my part I think the Shah has
                        developed a more relaxed relationship with the Soviet Union and should not
                        be discouraged from continuing this attitude. He is under no illusions, and
                        yet is attempting to reduce tensions with his difficult northern neighbor
                        through more normal trade and other relationships.</p>
                    <p>I would hope the President would concentrate his discussion on the other two
                        points listed, namely, Soviet objectives to break Irano-American friendship,
                        and caution not to let economic relations with the Soviets endanger Iran's
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps also caution not to spend too much on military at expense of economic
                            development.<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">This last paragraph is typed in

                        <persName>Lem Johns</persName> has just passed on to me the following
                        information which I thought would be of interest to you:</p>
                    <p>From 4 p.m. to midnight this date approximately 60 to 150 members of the
                        Iranian Students' Association will demonstrate in the northeast corner of
                        Lafayette Park. This is an anti-Iranian group and they originally requested
                        that they be permitted to wear masks to prevent recrimination against
                        relatives still residing in Iran. Legal counsel for the Park Service had no
                        reason to disallow the permit and it was granted, and no one has any
                        objections of a legal nature which would prevent their wearing masks in the
                        District.</p>
                    <p>This group originally requested to demonstrate right directly in front of the
                        White House on the sidewalk area, and this was denied for security reasons.
                        This means that this anti-Shah group will be in the vicinity of the White
                        House during the arrival ceremony and State Dinner tonight for the Shah of
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Lem</persName> also tells me that Secret Service is advising
                        against any walking between the White House and Blair House either after the
                        arrival ceremony or tonight for the State Dinner.</p>

                            the Middle East together, because the Shah has broader contacts than
                            most leaders. For instance, you understand the Shah, at his recent
                            meeting with President <persName>Ayub</persName> and the Turkish Prime

                            Stated not possible at this time estimate increase for 1968. Stressed

                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Shah concurred fully with latter point saying he would not ask
                            companies do anything else, that if West forced out and others came into
                            moderate Arab countries it would be bad for Iran. While stating that
                            nothing should be done to hurt Saudis, Shah said that potential growth
                            in Saudi oil exports should come instead from Iran. On other hand,
                            Kuwait does not require increased oil income, Libya is weak and any
                            increase in Libyan prosperity would only whet Nasser's appetite take
                            country over. Shah added he knows Iran could not replace any one Arab
                            producer except possibly Iraq. He told companies second export terminal
                            to supplement <persName>Kharg</persName> is needed and they should step
                            up exploration. He reported French had made no important finds but had
                            found promising seismic structure offshore in Gulf, which, however, may
                            prove dry. He then raised subject of trans-Turkey oil pipeline, saying
                            Iran not willing rely on Suez Canal and that while pipeline might not be
                            economically sensible it was politically necessary.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>While indicating concern about reliability of canal, companies noted
                            that increasing size of tankers and tanker fleet make pipeline
                            politically unnecessary. (Companies have informed us they will not
                            commit themselves to participate in pipeline project. One of reasons is
                            they question long-term reliability of Turkey.)</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Shah did not press oil pipeline project and turned conversation to
                            gas, including gas pipeline to Europe and hope that companies would <pb
                                n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>involve themselves in
                            petrochemicals in Iran. He indicated desire make Iranian oil fully
                            competitive and mentioned progress in reducing redundant labor in oil
                            installations in Iran.</item>

                        <item>Companies consider conversation part of useful continuing dialogue
                            which they and Shah find helpful. They found Shah's usual speeches
                            milder than often in past. In sum, they feel results of conversation
                            “not too bad,” although they remain concerned that Iranian expectations
                            will continue to exceed realities.</item>

                            readily admitted that in the current context we could have no motive for

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>There was considerable discussion of the Arab-Israeli war with
                            particular reference to Israeli tactics, the weaknesses of the Egyptian
                            armed forces, and the phenomenon of Soviet miscalculation and
                            misassessment. The Shah said that he had never dreamed the Israelis
                            could win the war as rapidly as they did. He was obviously impressed
                            when the undersigned told him that the President had been given
                            estimates from this Agency before the war began, stating, within
                            reasonable limits, exactly what happened.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>There followed some discussion of the Shah's talk with the President
                            last evening which would not be an appropriate part of this memorandum.
                            He then discussed this theory of arms purchases, his plan for the
                            Iranian air force, and his general philosophy about the military
                            position of Iran. To the extent that the recipients of this memorandum
                            are interested in these points, the undersigned would be glad to present
                            them orally.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The meeting ended with a rather lengthy dissertation by the Shah on
                            his view of Iran in the world today, what he is trying to do with his
                            people, and where he would like to end up a few years hence in terms of
                            his country's health and social well-being. Before the undersigned took
                            his leave, he gave the Shah an Agency study entitled “The Outlook for
                            Communist China”. The Shah seemed pleased to receive this piece of
                            paper, understood its sensitivity, and promised to guard it with
                            care.</item>

                    <p>The Shah said that he had met with oil company officials in New York and had
                        indicated to them that they should support countries which are stable and
                        reliable and that they merely caused trouble by giving so much to small
                        desert countries such as Kuwait. He hoped the companies would agree.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on Arab oil policies, he said it was ridiculous for any Arab to
                        believe that the West could really be hurt by an Arab oil embargo. Iranian,
                        Venezuelan and American oil are available. The West could stand an oil
                        embargo for a couple of years, but the Arab countries could not. Agreeing,
                        the Secretary commented that he has found it useful to suggest to our
                        moderate Arab friends that they make this point. The Shah said he has been
                        doing the same thing. The Secretary said the Arab countries would not only
                        hurt themselves in the short run by imposing an oil embargo, but they might
                        cause the West to turn away from Middle East oil and substitute nuclear
                        power on a crash basis.</p>
                    <p>The Shah mentioned plans for an oil pipeline across Turkey to the
                        Mediterranean, for a gas pipeline from Iran to Trieste and for an oil import
                        terminal in Yugoslavia to supply Eastern Europe. On the latter point, he
                        said that the Eastern European market for oil is of course a limited one. As
                        for gas, he said that he would much prefer to use Iranian gas to make
                        petrochemical products, especially fertilizers, for Iran and for export. He
                        had urged the oil companies to interest themselves and others in this
                        possibility. In the meantime, however, Iran was making plans to export gas,
                        and it seemed desirable to have customers in addition to the Soviet
                        Union.</p>

                    <p>The Air Force has developed what I believe is an ingenious proposal for
                        meeting the Shah's request to the President for additional pilot training
                        for his Air Force. As you know, the Shah asked for a total of 75 spaces for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68, but Major General <persName
                            corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>, the US <gloss
                            target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief in Iran, has assured us that the
                        program he has worked out with the Iranian Supreme Commander's Staff (which
                        calls for only 60 pilot spaces per year) is perfectly adequate. (Copy
                            attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 jet pilot training program for Iran
                        currently is programmed at 29 spaces, 24 grant and 5 sales. The Air Force
                        has agreed to make 15 more spaces available for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 68 (recouped from Australia and Saudi Arabia), and proposes
                        to train 16 additional Iranian pilots in its basic T–28 (propeller-driven)
                        program for 9 months and to send <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                        instructor pilots to Iran thereafter to give the 16 transition training to
                        jets in country. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>
                        thinks this arrangement would be satisfactory to Iran (the Shah learned to
                        fly jets in this manner) and believes that the 60 pilots thus trained in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 would meet the Shah's needs. 24
                        spaces would be grant aid and 36 <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>This does not solve the need for additional spaces in future years, which
                        turns on other <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> decisions now pending. I
                        recommend, however, that you reply to the White House that <gloss

                        and that the foregoing proposal be discussed with the Shah during his

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>Gene</persName>:</p>
                    <p>In compliance with your request I am furnishing you hereby an account of my
                        conversation with the Shah of Iran this morning.</p>
                    <p>The Shah received the Board of Governors of the Iranian-American Society of
                        which I am a member. As this short reception was terminating the Shah asked
                        me to stay behind as he wanted to have a word with me. He went straight to
                        the point and said that he had had reports that I had been engaged in a
                        Middle East study and that it included a recommendation for a naval force in
                        the Indian Ocean. The Shah did not indicate the source of his
                        information.</p>
                    <p>I replied that in fact I had been engaged in a long range policy study for
                        the entire area of the Middle East and that the study included a
                        recommendation that the establishment of such a force be examined as to
                        feasibility, cost, etc. I reminded the Shah of the several conversations we
                        had had in 1964 prior to the visit of the Concord Squadron (I took him to
                        the Gulf of Oman where he spent a day and night witnessing weapons displays
                        aboard <hi rend="italic">Bon Homme Richard</hi>).</p>
                    <p>The Shah said that he hoped that such a force would be established and asked
                        what part Iran could play in it. I said that the plans as to composition
                        etc. were not made; but that personally I assumed that if such a force were
                        established that one of its missions would be support for U.K., U.S. and
                        Iranian naval forces in the Persian Gulf and that again, speaking
                        personally, I presumed that Iranian ships might take part in exercises. The
                        Shah said that that was fine and that although, at the present moment, he
                        had no ships capable of forming a part of such a force that he expected to
                        in the near future and hoped that Iranian participation would be considered.
                        He asked to be kept informed as to progress and any future decisions.</p>
                    <p>I concluded this part of our conversation by reminding the Shah again that
                        the proposal was just that and that it had not been staffed out nor had any
                        decisions been made.</p>

                    <p>I met privately with the Shah of Iran on Thursday, August 24, 1967, at 1:00
                        p.m. The conversation lasted 45 minutes, with no staff present.</p>
                    <p>The Shah told me he was extremely impressed by the President's sincerity and
                        firm grasp. He believed the President when he said, “When a man gives his
                        pledge, that pledge must be kept.” He was very pleased with his two private
                        meetings with you. He was deeply touched when you personally escorted him
                        into a meeting that was going on with legislators, and was delighted when
                        Mrs. Johnson came over to sit beside him. The meetings with the President
                        were exactly what he had been looking for.</p>
                    <p>The Shah said his prime purpose was to explain to the President what he has
                        been trying to accomplish in his own country and in the Middle East, and was
                        pleased that the President understood so clearly.</p>
                    <p>He assured me of his support of your position in the Near East.</p>
                    <p>The strategic position of Iran as he understands it is that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is attacking Iran and the Middle East by
                        using Nasser to throw the United Kingdom out of the Red Sea, the South
                        Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. Nasser has seized the Yemen and has the
                        strongest clandestine apparatus present within Aden and the South Arabian
                        Federation. If Nasser and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> succeed
                        in controlling the entrances of both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, Iran
                        could be cut off.</p>
                    <p>“It is for these reasons that Nasser must be defeated. This is the primary
                        strategic threat to Iran.” The Shah does not believe the United States fully
                        appreciates this threat.</p>
                    <p>He strongly urged that the United States continue to work with the moderates
                        in the Arab world. He considers himself in Iran as the major counterweight
                        in the Far East to Syria, Algeria, and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>, and a reliable associate of the United States.</p>
                    <p>He was anxious that the United States understand his need to maintain his
                        defensive position. Therefore, he went into detail about his defensive
                        forces. He is proud that Iran is now paying for its own defense. He
                        explained that his reliance upon the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        for military equipment is on a very low level and that Iran is getting much
                        more from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than it is giving.</p>
                    <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0454"/>
                    <p>He is fully aware of the danger of Soviet infiltration as a result of this
                        influx of military equipment, and he has therefore very greatly strengthened
                        his intelligence and security system.</p>
                    <p>On the current situation in the Middle East, the Shah said he had been
                        impressed by Israel's Great Victory. He now worried about the appearance of
                        arrogance he detected in Israel's behavior.</p>
                    <p>As for the Israelis, he stressed their need to be magnanimous and not
                        arrogant. He was especially anxious that the Israelis move on the refugee
                        problem. If they do not follow such a general line, he feels that Nasser
                        will be able to unify the Arabs once again. He feels that he has a good
                        relationship with the Israelis and wants to continue to be of help on their
                        problem with the Arab states. He specifically indicated that Iran and
                        Tunisia could work together for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The Shah spoke quite frankly about <persName>Ayub Khan</persName>. He said he
                        had spoken “very firmly” to <persName>Ayub</persName> about
                            <persName>Ayub</persName>'s overdependence on Communist China.</p>
                    <p>He has told <persName>Ayub</persName> that the best friend of the Paks is the
                        United States and he warned against a Pakistani relationship with Russia, as
                        well as Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the Persian Gulf, the Shah said that as the United Kingdom
                        gradually leaves the Persian Gulf area, the only Free World partners able to
                        fill that vacuum are Iran and Saudi Arabia. He hopes that he can come ever
                        closer to the President in meeting this extremely dangerous situation.</p>
                    <p>In all these matters I was careful to listen sympathetically, but to confine
                        my remarks to generalities.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You will be pleased to know that the Shah left extremely happy. Your taking
                        him over to the East Room Wednesday made a big impression. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> asked me to thank you.</p>
                    <p>In Walt's absence, he has suggested that I send you this memo to make sure we
                        issue any instructions that need to be given.</p>
                    <p>We also want to be sure Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName> is able to handle effectively any misinterpretations
                        the Shah may have taken away.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Pilot Training</hi>. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> has arranged jet training for 60
                        Iranian pilots. He will enter 44 in regular advance jet training school here
                        in the U.S. The rest will go through basic propeller training here and
                        transition to jets under U.S. instructors in Iran. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> has so far arranged for 60, instead
                        of the 75 the Shah mentioned, because our chief of military mission in
                        Tehran understands from the Shah's Supreme Commander that this is the number
                        required this year.</p>
                    <p>I would propose offering the above program to the Iranians with the
                        understanding that Defense will go to 75 if that turns out to be the number
                        needed. Is this consistent with your promise to the Shah?</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">Yes. I only promised to meet his need <note n="2"

                    <p rend="flushleft">No. I promised 75</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Future Military Aid</hi>. We suggested saying only that
                        you want to continue our military relationship beyond current agreements but
                        can't make any promises until we know what limits Congress has set. Did you
                        go any further than this?</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">Yes. I said we'd do everything possible to meet his
                        needs/2/</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">No. I stuck to the above line</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Middle East Settlement</hi>. Did the Shah indicate his
                        intention to play any specific role in pressing <persName>Hussein</persName>
                        to come to terms with Israel?</p>

                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Oil</hi>. We expected the Shah to ask that you urge U.S.
                        oil companies to increase their oil offtake from Iran. Did you give him any
                        encouragement to expect a better response from them?</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">Yes. I said we'd talk to them</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">No. I said these are company matters</p>

                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>. The Shah is considering collecting a small
                        group of responsible countries to hasten a peaceful solution in Vietnam.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommended that you
                        simply offer to be open handed and frank in dealing with such a group. Did
                        your discussions with the Shah go beyond this?</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">Yes. I asked him to press this</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">No. I stuck to the Secretary's line</p>

                        <item>Shah's August 22–24 visit to Washington was eminently successful in
                            convincing him that U.S. regards him as true friend whose constructive
                            and progressive leadership we greatly admire and whose counsel we highly
                            value. On three public occasions President spoke of Iran's progress and
                            Shah's leadership in glowing terms. Public praise was bestowed by others
                            as well. Shah is unquestionably delighted and refreshed by his visit and
                            found his reception here surpassing his greatest <pb n="429"
                                xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>expectations. On his side, he made
                            plain his desire to lead his people into twentieth century, to maintain
                            Iran's independence, and to retain close ties with U.S. In public
                            statements he several times stated his admiration for President Johnson
                            and the inspiration he and Iranian people receive from the President's
                            devotion to American ideals which Iran shares.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Shah had two long and cordial private talks with President Johnson. He
                            also had hour-long meetings with the Vice President and with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. He had friendly meeting
                            with Senate Foreign Relations Committee in which Senators were
                            hospitable in every respect and in which he made clear he would obtain
                            arms elsewhere if U.S. unable meet Iran's needs. His meetings and dinner
                            with American businessmen gave him opportunity describe Iran's economic
                            progress and goals, and he received warm response, some proposals and
                            considerable adulation from businessmen whose firms already operating in
                            Iran.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Talks with U.S. officials involved no negotiations but were thorough
                            exchanges of views on matters of common concern in the world and on
                            domestic goals, problems and achievements of both countries. Shah raised
                            question of training for jet pilots and received assurance his needs
                            would be met. Joint press release following second meeting with
                            President included statement that two countries will cooperate in
                            studying development of Iranian water resources. In response to
                            suggestion by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Shah
                            indicated he would look into establishing fellowships for American
                            students in Iranian universities.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Press coverage of visit included especially thorough reports on
                            arrival and White House dinner. Other aspects highlighted were Shah's
                            interest in Iran-U.S. military relationship, Shah's views on Middle East
                            situation and student demonstrations.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Student demonstrations, which resulted in some scuffling with police
                            and a few arrests, involved at different times number of students
                            varying between 10 and 50 and some anti-Shah and anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> placards and leaflets. Demonstrators
                            were kept well away from Shah except on couple of occasions when they
                            managed to throw leaflets at his caravan. Shah and his party took
                            demonstrations in stride and they certainly did not mar success of visit
                            in any way despite tendency of press to give them more attention than
                            they deserved.</item>

                        guns recently purchased from the U.S.S.R. The Shah requested such advice
                        earlier this month, and the Country Team, Stricom and State have strongly
                        endorsed the move as a way to minimize the Soviet presence and influence in
                        Iran. Should additional U.S. personnel be required to discharge these new
                        responsibilities, the Iranians are prepared to underwrite the cost of their
                        services.</p>

                    <p>By constitutional amendment Iran has provided for a Regency Council to assist
                        the Crown Prince should he succeed to the throne before he is 20. Coronation
                        of the Shah and Empress <persName>Farah</persName> will take place on
                        October 26. This paper takes a brief look at the history of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_PMR1">Pahlavi</persName> Dynasty and analyzes the succession
                        arrangements as they now stand.</p>

                        <persName>Reza Shah</persName> the Great was crowned the first King of the
                        Pahlavi Dynasty in 1926 and remained on the throne for 15 years until the
                        British forced him into exile and his son <persName>Mohamed Reza</persName>
                        became Shah. The formal coronation has never taken place, although the
                        present Shah has ruled for just over 26 years. His first two marriages
                        produced no male heir, but a son was born to the Shah and Queen
                            <persName>Farah</persName> in 1960. Although succession was thus
                        assured, the Shah did not see fit to provide for a Regency Council until he
                        had stabilized the monarch's position and had found a trusted person who
                        could serve as Regent without constituting at the same time a potential
                        rival. Empress <persName>Farah</persName>'s warm personality has proved a
                        definite asset to the Shah's social modernization program, particularly in
                        regard to women's rights, and for the last year she has filled an
                        increasingly official role during various trips inside Iran. On September 7
                        a Constituent Assembly approved changes in the Iranian Constitution which
                        provide that she will serve as Regent for the Crown Prince in case he
                        assumes the throne before he is 20. The Shah will crown himself and then
                        Empress Farah in splendid ceremony on October 26, his birthday, with Crown
                        Prince <persName>Reza Cyrus</persName> Ali looking on in implicit emphasis
                        of the planned continuation of the Pahlavi Dynasty.</p>

                    <p>After greetings Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> opened by
                        saying our long-standing friendship with Iran made it possible to discuss
                        problems which arise between us in a completely frank manner (the Ambassador
                        concurred) and frankly, the Iranian requests to the U.S. Government both
                        here and in Tehran to insure greatly increased petroleum exports from Iran
                        had caused us considerable difficulty. The Department and the U.S.
                        Government had considerable sympathy for Iran's aspirations and great
                        admiration for its plans for development but this did not mean we were able
                        to translate this sympathy and admiration into pressures on the American
                        companies in the Consortium to comply with the Iranian wishes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> said that there should be
                        no confusion about the relationship between American companies operating
                        abroad and the Department of State. We give advice to companies before they
                        go into a country, if they ask for it; we especially want our views known in
                        cases where the companies ask for U.S. Government assistance. But once a
                        company is in a country it is on its own. There are certainly some
                        disadvantages to this but on balance we believe that they are far outweighed
                        by the advantages in our free system where companies act according to their
                        commercial interests rather than in following instruction from the U.S.
                        Government. The host countries can therefore look on local branches of
                        American firms as good citizens, not as tools of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>It is very important to recognize both the very limited nature of U.S.
                        influence over private firms and the reluctance, or even inability of the
                        U.S. Government to set commercial policies of these firms abroad. Venezuela
                        for example has tried for eight years to get special consideration for its
                        oil exports. While the case is not comparable to the Iranian requests <pb
                            n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0461"/>there are some similarities.
                        Venezuela is one of our best friends in the Hemisphere and we have a common
                        problem with <persName>Castro</persName> but nonetheless, we have
                        consistently refused to permit these important political factors to
                        influence our purely commercial policy toward Venezuelan oil.</p>
                    <p>If the State Department should try to influence companies to favor Iran or
                        any other country, the reaction from companies operating elsewhere and from
                        Congress would be immediate and hostile. We can tell the American companies
                        in the Consortium of the Iranian approaches to us and we can give them our
                        views on the importance of Iran, as we have done repeatedly, but in spite of
                        our warm friendship for Iran we cannot do more and Iran should not think
                        that these mild interventions will outweigh the companies' own purely
                        commercial interests.</p>
                    <p>There are many complex factors, which the companies have to consider. The
                        comparative cost of oil in Iran and elsewhere is extremely important. And
                        all of the American companies have interests in other oil producing
                        countries which must be protected. (Incidentally it seems to us that it is
                        in the interest of both Iran and the United States for such moderate Arab
                        nations in the area as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to be strengthened.)</p>
                    <p>We are very interested in the Consortium activities and note with pleasure
                        that it has shown its willingness to see that Iran gets its fair share of
                        the Middle East offtake, but given the vagaries of the oil industry, it is
                        impossible to make long-term commitments for offtake from Iran for the next
                        five years or even through 1970.</p>
                    <p>We can also understand why the companies in the Consortium are disturbed by
                        the Iranian desire to revise or even discard the 1966 offtake agreement only
                        ten months after it had been concluded to the apparent satisfaction of all
                        parties. As the Ambassador himself has noted, the continuing Iranian
                        pressure on the Consortium to use all production facilities to their
                        capacity has caused it to be reluctant to enlarge facilities until they are
                        actually needed. This does not seem in the interest of anyone, as surplus
                        capacity in Iran is necessary if Iran is to increase production rapidly
                        during any future oil crisis.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Consortium has a vast marketing network which is extremely
                        important to Iran especially during times of a surplus of world oil
                        production. We would hope that the amicable relationship between the
                        Consortium and the Government of Iran, which has proven so profitable to
                        Iran, would continue uninterrupted.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said the points were well made but he feared that the
                        companies were ignoring other important considerations. Iran believes that
                        its special position warrants special treatment; Iran has a development
                        program which increases the wealth and the stability of Iran and thereby
                        benefits the West and the Western oil companies. Iran is particularly
                        disturbed at the increase in production of certain small Arab <pb n="434"
                            xml:id="pg_434" facs="0462"/>countries who are given far more money than
                        they can use and who then give or lend this surplus capital to men like
                        Nasser. The Iranians consider it ironic that the Western oil companies are
                        willing to increase production and therefore royalties and taxes to these
                        small countries which are, quite directly, financing a man who is committed
                        to their destruction and to wiping out all Western influence in the Middle
                        East. Such a policy can only aggravate the instability of the area. Iran
                        believes that there is more than short-term economic profit to be considered
                        and the oil companies should look once again at what Iran is doing with its
                        income and compare it with actions of the small Arab countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> said U.S. has investments
                        abroad valued at about $71 billion. The world-wide investment in oil is of
                        course important but it is only a minority of the total. American companies
                        operating abroad act according to their own economic interests as they see
                        them and none serves as a tool of the U.S. Government. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName> then said that the American oil
                        companies have important investments in the small Arab countries the
                        Ambassador referred to and if any of the local rulers thought that the
                        American parent companies were shifting their emphasis from the Arab world
                        to Iran—particularly if they suspected it was at U.S. Government
                        instigation—they would certainly retaliate against the American firms.</p>
                    <p>We must also be aware of the danger that general, undiscriminating pressure
                        frequently results in a reaction quite the opposite from that which is
                        intended.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador concluded by saying that it was clear that the Consortium
                        could not make firm commitments for the next five years; Iran had not asked
                        for this but only for an agreement in principle to increase production. The
                        next development plan, starting in March of 1986, is based on a large income
                        from the exploitation of oil and Iran must have this money. The problems
                        might start even before the new development plan; the Ambassador had just
                        been informed that because the increase in oil earnings was less than
                        expected, Iran would probably have deficit of $110 million this year.</p>
                    <p>A short discussion of Iran's economic development followed.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said Iran had a 9.5 percent growth in <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss> last year and expected to have 11 percent this year—and all
                        with a price inflation of only 0.5%. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4"
                            >Solomon</persName> commented that oil had made all this possible. The
                        Ambassador agreed, said that income from oil now runs about $700 million per
                        year and provides about 70–75% of Iran's foreign exchange earnings. But this
                        does not mean that more money is not needed.</p>
                    <p>After leaving Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName>'s office,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> commented on Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAM4">Solomon</persName>'s lucid presentation of
                        the U.S. position and said it was important that it be understood in Tehran.
                        While it is possible to explain some things in letters or telegrams some of
                        the more subtle <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>points may be lost.
                        He said he thought he should return to Tehran to explain the U.S. position
                        directly to his government before the Iranian position hardens to the point
                        where retreat might be impossible.</p>

                        finally reached agreement on foreign aid legislation. Report says conferees

                        promised Shah in August that administration continues desire supply
                        equipment to Iran but definitive determination depended on Congressional

                    <p>3. Since my return, Shah has three times stated he is awaiting conclusion of
                        Congressional deliberations. He made clear his strong desire to maintain
                        American orientation his military establishment but if there is uncertainty
                        he will purchase elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>4. Having provided Iran with most of its military establishment via grant
                        aid, Shah cannot understand <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s
                        unwillingness to provide arms via credit sales now that Iran is in position
                        to pay. Acquiring arms from elsewhere increases costs and decreases
                        efficiency of Iran's military establishment. Thus Shah's incomprehension
                        tends toward resentment.</p>
                    <p>5. Realize it may be difficult to sort out where conference committee
                        agreement leaves us as far as arms sales to Iran are concerned. However, we
                        need to have as soon as possible position to take with Shah.</p>
                    <p>6. Was there any hope that by June 30, 1968 other avenues might be devised
                        which would permit credit sales to Iran on terms not too unattractive? Would
                        language of legislation permit credit sales to Iran if we determine that
                        Iran is not an underdeveloped country, a determination <pb n="436"
                            xml:id="pg_436" facs="0464"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has already made as far as imposing
                        interest equalization tax is concerned? Are there avenues other than that
                        which Congress is terminating as of June 30, 1968 which might be opened for
                        maintaining our relationship with Iran?</p>
                    <p>7. Needless to say, our first reaction here is that Congress has dealt a
                        crippling blow to our relations with Iran. Tragically, it comes at a time
                        when after Shah's Washington visit and Iran's own remarkable progress
                        relations between our two countries are at a high. Blow also comes at time
                        when it seems to us <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should be preserving
                        friendships with countries like Iran. Aside from friendship, we have at
                        stake number of facilities vital to our national security.</p>
                    <p>8. Since this is number one problem for Iran and since Shah raised it with
                        President, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> should not rule out
                        possibility of direct message from President to Shah explaining state of
                        play. Hopefully message could contain some assurance that all hope is not
                        lost for continuing mutually beneficial military cooperation between our two
                        countries.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>It is now almost three months since I had the pleasure of visiting you and
                        your country, and I am still under the very vivid impression of your
                        hospitality and your warm and friendly reception. I also have the best
                        recollection of our talks and I am happy to witness the very close bonds of
                        friendship, understanding and mutual good will which exist between our two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>As you know, Mr. President, we are planning for the next five years a
                        development program, starting in March, 1968, which will bring further <pb
                            n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>great progress in our economic
                        life. We hope to achieve an annual nine percent increase in our Gross
                        National Product, and we would be delighted to welcome any American firms or
                        private individual participation in our projects, especially in the fields
                        of petrochemicals and agriculture. I remember with pleasure having discussed
                        with you the further development of our agriculture and the great interest
                        you showed in the possibilities in this domain.</p>
                    <p>This would allow us to develop the agricultural resources of our country more
                        fully, and to provide sufficient fertilizers for the production of more food
                        and thus contribute to forestall and eliminate the danger of hunger and
                        famine, which is one of the key problems threatening the world at large
                        today.</p>
                    <p>We are also waiting for the America team to study water conservation, and the
                        desalination plan, in Iran, which constitute an essential part of our
                        development programme.</p>
                    <p>We very much expect the American Oil Companies to try to export the maximum
                        oil they can from our country, with the full knowledge that the stability of
                        Iran helps the maintenance of stability in the whole area, which, in turn,
                        guarantees their oil exports from the other countries in this region as
                        well. Your personal interest in this respect, Mr. President, would be
                        greatly appreciated by us.</p>
                    <p>As for our military needs, we see modern, and sometimes very sophisticated
                        weapons, pouring into some of our neighbouring countries, which compels us
                        to take appropriate military preparedness measures. We have revised the
                        organization of our armed forces and set ourselves a new five year plan.
                        Since 1964 we have entered into two credit agreements with your country,
                        each for two hundred million dollars, and also obtained credits for
                        approximately three hundred million dollars from other sources. A rough
                        estimate of the requirements over the next five years of military equipment
                        for carrying out the new plan for our armed forces organization is in the
                        order of 800 million dollars.</p>
                    <p>Although our Air Force, as planned for the future, is still weak in the
                        number of aircraft, we hope that by getting the best and most modern
                        equipment, and by having good and efficient pilots and maintenance, it would
                        carry out the very heavy duty imposed upon it.</p>
                    <p>I wish the day will come when all of us will only have to think of building
                        schools, hospitals, and homes for old people, and other essentials of
                        civilization. We are certainly working towards that end; but before that day
                        comes we have no other choice but to guarantee the security and independence
                        of our sacred land and nation.</p>
                    <p>Such are the needs of my country. We would like to buy our needs in your
                        country if your Government could offer the necessary credit
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0466"/>
                    <p>I would be most grateful, Mr. President, if you would provide all we need, or
                        at least tell us what we can expect, as we must, in the cases mentioned
                        above, put in our orders now.</p>
                    <p>Considering the encouraging results already obtained in all branches of our
                        economy, I lay great store in this our next five year development plan,
                        which has been carefully drawn up in order to raise further the standard of
                        living of the individual in my country.</p>
                    <p>I still recall with pleasure the kind words you uttered, in your address of
                        welcome during my recent visit to Washington, concerning the progress that
                        we, in Iran, have achieved in terms of economic prosperity. It is our firm
                        intention to strive further in this respect.</p>
                    <p>Hoping, Mr. President, that you will give these matters your considerate
                        attention, I express to you my heartfelt good wishes for your welfare and
                        happiness, and success in your noble task. I seize this opportunity to
                        convey, on behalf of the Empress and myself, our kindest regards to Mrs.
                        Johnson.</p>

                        <item>A fortnight after his coronation, the Shah was in a relaxed but sober
                            mood reflecting confidence in his domestic program, his role as a <pb
                                n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0468"/>leader in the Middle East and
                            his relations with the Great Powers—a confidence mixed with concern and
                            some anxiety about obvious elements in the Middle East situation which
                            continue to threaten his own ambitions for the area.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Although priorities in Iranian foreign policy now rest on his decision
                            to develop regional strengths that will give the Middle East nations a
                            common capability to contain and live with the threat of Soviet
                            pressures, his policy rests on the premise that his special and primary
                            relationship with the United States can be preserved a few years more.
                            Strengthened relations with Pakistan and Turkey remain the basis of his
                            regional policy; as <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> fades, other
                            military and economic arrangements in which the US and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> play no direct role are expanding. He has
                            found it necessary to give Ayub “virtually an ultimatum” to get his
                            foreign affairs in order; he sees Pakistan gradually turning more to the
                            West, placing more confidence on regional security arrangements, being
                            less dependent on the Great Powers and emphasizing Islamic rather than
                            radical Afro-Asian associations.</item>

                        <item>The Shah's relations with the Arab-Israel world remain complicated. In
                            the Cold War context his sympathies lie entirely with Israel; the defeat
                            of the radical Arabs in June dramatically served Iran's interest. <hi

                            Denial of the <persName>Persian Gulf</persName>, the Arabian Peninsula
                            and the lower end of the Red Sea Basin to the Soviet Union and the
                            radical Arabs is the strategic goal that constitutes the basis for this
                            relationship. Arms captured by the Israelis in June are now finding
                            their way via Iran into friendly Arab hands in the Yemen. The expansion
                            of the Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean, the appearance of “Red Beret
                            Russian Marines” and the military implications of the Elath sinking were
                            all on the <hi rend="italic">[1–1/2 lines of source text not

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Overtly, the Shah continues to associate Iran with the Arab, but more
                            particularly the Islamic, cause in the context of the Arab-Israel
                            conflict. He told me that during April 1967 he had advised
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> to give vigorous armed response to any
                            repetition by Israel of the 13 November 1966 raid on
                                <persName>Samu</persName> in Jordan's West Bank; this action was
                            essential, in the Shah's view, to <persName>Hussein</persName>'s
                            survival. Since the war, the Israelis have approached the Shah seeking
                            his assistance in mediation efforts with Jordan; the Shah declined
                            because he did not feel that <persName>Hussein</persName> and moderate
                            forces in Jordan could survive reaction in the Arab world to a
                            unilateral <persName>Jordan</persName> role. While the Shah has
                            reservations about <persName>Hussein</persName>'s judgement, he argues
                            that <persName>Hussein</persName>'s survival is vital to Iranian and
                            American interests.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The Shah is relaxed about the expansion of French influence in Middle
                            East oil and arms. The Shah takes a positive view of the prospect of
                            some standardization of aircraft—Mirage in the short run—in Pakistan,
                            Jordan, Saudi Arabia and possibly other Arab countries. However, <pb
                                n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0469"/>he is emphatic in his view that
                            the Turkish and Iranian Air Forces must be based on US equipment and
                            doctrine. This was one of two points raised by the Shah in comparatively
                            strong language. The other dealt with the attacks on the President
                            concerning his Vietnam policy.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>We had examined the likelihood that Moscow, sooner or later, would
                            have to take a hard look at Khrushchev's policy of providing armed
                            support for “just wars of national liberation”. In four areas of the
                            world—Southeast Asia, the Arab Near East, Africa and the Western
                            Hemisphere, the Soviets had gained no favorable decision, had suffered
                            several disasters and had seen the price of the game rising steadily. I
                            had said that I thought the time for a Soviet reappraisal of
                            Khrushchev's policy might come after President Johnson was re-elected. A
                            decision by the Soviets to write off the Vietnam War—following the
                            disaster which struck them in the Middle East in June 1967—could, I
                            said, mark the turning point in Soviet policy. In this case, President
                            Johnson would emerge in history as “one of our greatest Presidents”.
                            With some vigor the Shah interrupted and corrected my statement—“he will
                            emerge as the greatest President of the United States; the toughness and
                            courage demonstrated by him in sticking to his position when under
                            attack from all those in the US and abroad who oppose his Vietnam policy
                            is inspiring to all of us who know that he is right”.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>The Shah feels that trade with and aid from the Soviet Union is
                            entirely compatible with his basic policy of seeking to build a strong
                            Middle East bloc of nations which will have normal relations with the
                            industrially developed powers, including Russia and all of Europe. He
                            seems confident that a combination of economic and social progress in
                            Iran and an effective and sharply oriented intelligence and security
                            effort keeping track of the Soviets in Iran will limit the dangers of
                            expanding trade and relations with the Soviets to a tolerable level. In
                            this task, he desires to retain his special relationship with the United
                            States. I assured him that in intelligence matters, the United States
                            benefits as much as if not more than Iran in this close
                            cooperation.</item>

                                >Jablonsky</persName> has received confirmation that Iranians have
                            agreed to 40 million ruble extension of Soviet-Iranian arms deal.
                            Equipment purchased consists of 2200 Zil jeeps for gendarmerie, 200
                            wheeled <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s, 300 track <gloss

                            given much-publicized Congressional curtailing of US arms sales and
                            attractiveness of getting Soviet equipment “for nothing,” i.e., in
                            exchange for Iranian natural gas until now flared, haste with which
                            Iranians have moved is disturbing. As recently as October 19, Shah gave

                            than anger I intend to stress how difficult it is to understand why Iran
                            would take such inopportune action when there really no urgency for such
                            add-on military equipment from Soviets. I intend also to note
                            unfortunate damage this causes Shah's image which has reached an
                            all-time high in US pursuant to <gloss target="#t_HIM1">HIM</gloss>'s

                            not fully sovereign, etc. Furthermore, we see little chance of deal
                            being recalled and, therefore, must consider it within framework of our

                                >Harriman</persName> 22nd, Shah said he is writing letter to

                            and Iran's desire to continue military procurement from the United
                            States. He described letter as follow-up to intimate discussions held
                            with President in August.</item>

                            legislative situation is still murky. He said we hope that we may be
                            able to proceed with next $50 million tranche but what will happen after
                            next June 30 is “in the lap of the gods.”</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Shah said just as Iran is projecting five-year economic program it is
                            also planning five-year military program. Question is, therefore,
                            important whether U.S. will be in position to continue military
                            supplying during that period. He noted since 1964 he has purchased $400
                            million from U.S. (including two tranches still not negotiated) and $300
                            [million] elsewhere. Program over upcoming five-year period, he noted,
                            is being planned at expenditure rate less than past three-year span.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> stressed importance
                            of giving priority to economic development.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Once again Shah emphasized his unqualified preference to maintaining
                            relationship with US in military field. Above all, he wants to keep air
                            force American oriented.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Key question, Shah said, is procurement of tanks. He would like
                            additional M–60's and Sheridans so that his total tank force eventually
                            will reach just over one thousand. When challenged re need for so many
                            tanks, Shah said his military is emphasizing mobility, will in fact have
                            fewer divisions, and in any case his goal is merely to place Iran “in
                            balance” with its neighbors. He noted proposed tank complement is only
                            three-fourths what Turks have.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>If US unable to supply Sheridans, Shah said he will seek British
                            tanks, i.e. Vickers. He was obviously annoyed that his hopes for tank
                            factory in Iran to supply Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries has
                            fallen through. His impression is that British are to build Vickers
                            factory in Pakistan, but I expressed doubt such deal been consummated.

                            Shah answered in negative and gave as reason that Iranians have
                            deliberately avoided encouraging Soviets in this sphere. After some
                            thought, he added that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would

                                <persName>Robert</persName>'s' recent visit, Shah said affirmation

                            this reason, Iran is determined to continue to build up its own military
                            strength so that it will be “in balance” with that of other states in
                            area. It also accounts for Iran's desire to develop closer and

                            by suggesting this experience was for me dramatic example of new

                            contribution is mix of several nationalities.</item>

                        <item>Shah was obviously exhilarated by launching above-mentioned projects.
                            In characteristic mood he said Iran would go on to greater heights in
                            economic development. Noting that natural gas has 2700 possible
                            derivatives, including even aspirin tablets, Shah said petrochemical
                            field is one area where Iran can achieve large-scale success. He looks
                            particularly to Americans who have leadership in petrochemicals to be
                            helpful. He also referred to special relationship with US which he
                            wishes to maintain in desalinization field.</item>

                        <item>There followed philosophical discussion of factors which have caused
                            Iranian spectacular success, e.g. oil income and its wise use, stability
                            stemming from cultural tradition of monarchy, Iran's ability to adjust
                            to changing times and to pick up good points from various societies.
                            When subject of strong leadership was mentioned, Shah quickly described
                            this as an ingredient temporary in nature. He said he looks forward to
                            day not too far distant when Iran will also take off in

                    </list>
                    <p>The Consortium maintains that the “negotiations” with Iran ended in agreement
                        among all parties in December, 1966, i.e., there would be an 11 percent
                        increase in offtake in 1967 and 1968. Because of the Middle East crisis,
                        Iranian production in 1967 will actually be over 20 percent above 1966
                        levels. Although the Consortium emphasizes it is not obligated by the
                        agreement to give any further increase in 1968, it has just assured Iran of
                        an increase in offtake of almost 9 percent over the high 1967 levels.</p>
                    <p>The Iranians have told the Consortium that this proposal for 1968 is not
                        satisfactory. They say Iran must have $6 billion from oil from now through
                        the end of the fourth development plan in March 1973. (Current production
                        plans and steady growth of about 10 percent per year would give Iran only
                        about $4.5 billion during this period.) The obvious way to get this income
                        would be through increased production but increased payments per barrel of
                        oil or company investment in Iran might also be satisfactory to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Iranians are particularly disturbed by the Consortium over-lift
                        provisions and believe that if they were changed the total offtake from Iran
                        would increase substantially. Last year I recommended to the American
                        participants, through Mr. <persName>Henry</persName> Moses of Mobil Oil,
                        that they should agree to a liberalization of the Consortium's over-lift
                        arrangements. The Consortium did alter those arrangements. Consortium
                        companies may now over-lift up to 15 percent of their Annual Programmed
                            Quantity—<gloss target="#t_APQ1">APQ</gloss>—share at a price halfway
                        between cost and posted price. Previously any volume above the <gloss
                            target="#t_APQ1">APQ</gloss> was to be over-lifted at full posted price.
                        But it is clear from our traffic on this problem that the Iranians since
                        last year have become fully informed as to the terms of the over-lift in
                        both Iran and Saudi Arabia and they have demanded specifically that the
                        Consortium adopt a system at least as favorable as the Aramco system. Aramco
                        companies can over-lift as much as they want above the amount their
                        shareholding in Aramco would entitle them to <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452"
                            facs="0480"/>have at a price equal to cost plus one quarter the
                        difference between cost and posted price.</p>
                    <p>The companies have explained to us that the Consortium as a whole usually
                        takes only about 93 percent of the <gloss target="#t_APQ1">APQ</gloss>—the
                        agreed total offtake for the year—and that the crude short companies (Shell,
                        Mobil, <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> and the Iricon group) are thus
                        able to take 7 percent above their “rightful” share at cost—a more favorable
                        arrangement than in Aramco. It is when they exceed this amount that they pay
                        the halfway price. (N.B.: It is in this case when the comparison with Aramco
                        becomes pertinent.) The Consortium companies say they have been unable to
                        explain this adequately to the Iranians without exposing the method of
                        setting <gloss target="#t_APQ1">APQ</gloss> and other Consortium rules and
                        regulations; and this cannot be done without causing great trouble for
                        Consortium. However, the companies have consistently told us and the
                        Iranians that the Aramco system would result in lower offtake for the
                        Consortium as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The Iranians have also demanded specifically that the 6.5 percent <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> discount be eliminated. If it were, Iran
                        would get about $0.10 per barrel of oil, and if the discount were completely
                        eliminated by January 1968, Iran would get about $200 million extra in the
                        next five years. Negotiations between Aramco and the Saudi Arabian
                        Government are continuing on this subject; Iran and other <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> members will get whatever Saudi Arabia
                        succeeds in getting from Aramco.</p>
                    <p>The Consortium members say they cannot increase offtake from Iran without
                        cutting back production in the Arab world and this cannot be done without
                        provoking a reaction from the Arabs. They have not yet been willing to
                        discuss large scale investment in Iran. However, the final Consortium
                        positions have not been established. Its members are now meeting in London
                        to discuss new proposals to Iran and the Iranians have said they can wait at
                        least until January to hear them.</p>

                            Consortium arrangements with the Iranians but point out that the <gloss

                            the over-lift arrangements in Aramco and the Consortium. We could tell
                            the companies our view that this has become an important issue with the
                            Iranians and we believe the Consortium would be well-advised to consider
                            adopting something they could call a “quarter-price” for over-liftings.
                            Even if Iran profited little, a troublesome issue would have been
                            eliminated and the Iranians would no longer be able to claim they were
                            being discriminated against.</item>

                            <p>I would recommend that we urge the companies to be as generous as
                                they can in making their next offer to the Iranians. However, we
                                should avoid making any further specific recommendations at this
                                time.</p>

                                in the talks than we have; but we hope <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                                point. While we probably can never get involved in making specific
                                offtake proposals, we might have to tell the companies sometime that
                                we believe there will be serious problems in Iran if, by 1973, it
                                does not reach the same level of exports as Saudi Arabia or, as a
                                minimum, does not enjoy the same absolute annual increase as that

                    <p>In short, he ticks off his own economic plans and hopes for U.S. private
                        investment much as he outlined them to you in August. He also urges you to
                        lean on our oil companies to increase their liftings from Iran—a perennial
                        request.</p>
                    <p>The main surprise is the size of his military program—$800 million. We think
                        that must be a bargaining figure.</p>
                    <p>He wants to know what he can count on from us. All we can say is that we are
                        going ahead with the third and fourth slices ($50 million <pb n="454"

                    <p>We've consistently tried to keep the brakes on his military spending, but
                        that's increasingly hard to do with his oil revenues rising as they are.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                    <p>I have now studied carefully your important letter of November 15<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d254fn2">

                        more detailed reply which I promised in my note of November 30.<note n="3"

                            <ref target="#d250">Document 250</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>First let me say that your visit here was one of the bright spots of the year
                        for me. I warmly appreciate the privilege of talking to a leader who <pb
                            n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0483"/>shares our views and approach to
                        the problems of the world and who understands the heavy burdens which those
                        problems place upon this country.</p>
                    <p>I also appreciate the cordial reception you gave on November 22 to Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> who has reported to me
                        on his valuable talk with you. I am glad we can maintain our continuing
                        exchange of thoughts through talks like that as well as by letter.</p>
                    <p>What you tell me of your new five-year development program is indeed good
                        news. The pace of Iran's development arouses deep admiration everywhere.</p>
                    <p>I am especially heartened that economic development will continue Iran's
                        major goal. We have worked closely with you in this field. Now with the
                        closing of our aid mission in Iran we look forward to a different, but
                        equally productive, kind of economic cooperation between our two countries.
                        We hope this will include increased participation by private American firms
                        in Iran's development, as you suggest, and we will do what we can to support
                        American investment there.</p>
                    <p>I am also glad that planning is moving ahead on the water resources study on
                        which we agreed in principle when you were here. I hope this will become
                        another important aspect of our continuing economic cooperation. Our team
                        can go to Iran as soon as we receive the preliminary data your authorities
                        will provide and we can complete the Memorandum of Understanding now in
                        Tehran for study.</p>
                    <p>In view of the importance of the revenues from Iran's petroleum resources to
                        the development of your country, it is natural that you should seek the
                        maximum in exports of oil from Iran. I know that the American oil companies,
                        for their part, take their commitments to the Government of Iran seriously.
                        While the policies of the oil companies are not without some limitations
                        deriving from commercial factors, I have every reason to believe that they
                        desire to assure that Iran will receive as favorable treatment as possible.
                        I was pleased to note Iran's outstanding 20 percent increase in crude
                        production in 1967 over 1966.</p>
                    <p>An added dividend of this healthy partnership is its encouragement of
                        investment in other fields such as petrochemicals. I hope that this mutually
                        beneficial relationship between Iran and the companies will continue to
                        flourish.</p>
                    <p>I also want to continue our close relationship with Iran in the military
                        field. We are ready to begin discussions on the third $50 million credit
                        tranche under the amended 1964 Memorandum of Understanding. We intend to
                        seek at the appropriate time the necessary authority and funds from the
                        Congress for the fourth $50 million credit tranche. We cannot, of course,
                        predict Congressional reaction to our worldwide credit sales request at this
                        time.</p>
                    <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>With regard to the future, you may be sure that the United States continues
                        to regard its military relationship with Iran as mutually important. As I
                        told you when you were here, we will continue to do our best to be helpful.
                        But it is still too early for me to say definitively what we can do beyond
                        what is covered in our existing agreements.</p>
                    <p>We need, first, to know more specifically what your equipment and credit
                        needs from us will be. I have heard from Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> of his and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName>'s discussions with you and your
                        military authorities, and I suggest that those discussions continue. I hope
                        that we will be able to assist you in assessing your equipment needs and in
                        reducing their costs. We have already begun exploring your credit needs in a
                        preliminary way with Governor Samii of your Central Bank.</p>
                    <p>In the light of Congressional views, we will also have to consider carefully
                        with you the implications of the substantial military expenditures you
                        project. You are, of course, the best judge of what Iran's security
                        requires, and I know your determination that every rial diverted from
                        economic and social development to military expenditures be spent in Iran's
                        national interests. However, my deep interest in the success of Your
                        Majesty's development program prompts some concern about the contemplated
                        size of your military program as mentioned in your letter and to Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, and we will wish to
                        discuss this concern with you.</p>
                    <p>It remains, Your Majesty, a source of great satisfaction to me to note the
                        example which Iran is setting in the Middle East through its economic and
                        social progress and its constructive position in international affairs. Your
                        statesmanship in the Arab-Israeli crisis and your current efforts to
                        strengthen your ties with the moderate Arab nations, as evidenced by your
                        forthcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, provide rays of hope and encouragement in
                        a troubled area. Americans everywhere are proud to have you and your country
                        as our friends.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Johnson and I would also like to take this opportunity to send you and
                        the Empress our warm good wishes.</p>

                        <item>My audience with Shah 28th turned out to be one of most unpleasant of
                            my tour here. He was obviously smouldering over devaluation shortfall
                            issue with which he had been preoccupied earlier in day (see
                            reftel).</item>

                            epithets, Shah professed to be completely disgusted with consortium's
                            behavior. At one point in discussion, Shah said if companies wanted war
                            they could have it. This time it would not be with a Mosadeq but with a
                            united Iran behind Shah himself.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>When I noted consortium believes it has legal basis for its position
                            and perhaps arbitration might be one possibility for solving devaluation
                            problem, Shah said arbitration is totally unacceptable. As for matter
                            being legal issue, Shah said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                            take care of that once and for all by immediate passage of legislation
                            which would insure <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> undepreciable
                            payments. Comment: Since this is critical point, I later sounded out
                            Shah again and received distinct impression that as of now unilateral
                            legislation which Shah has in mind for dealing with devaluation issue
                            will be limited to insuring value of payments. Question is, of course,
                            re wisdom of having any precedent set for unilateral legislation against
                            consortium.</item>

                            British Ambassador and consortium Chief <persName>O'Brien</persName> had
                            registered disapproval of consortium's action in reducing December 15

                        <item>Shah's bitterness splashed over whole oil picture. Re <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> discount problem, Shah contended
                            companies give with one hand, i.e. agree to phase-out of discount, but
                            then take back with other, i.e. gravity allowance. He said he had
                            doubted wisdom of Amuzegar's going to .52 cents on gravity allowance
                            figure but had gone along with it. Comment: [garble] Amuzegar indicated
                            (Tehran 2633)<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">Dated December 21.
                                (Ibid.)</note> that he had only gone to .45 cents in recent Tehran
                            discussions, Shah's use of .52 cents figure, which he repeated twice,
                            may mean that Amuzegar is prepared to move to that figure in attempt to
                            reach compromise.</item>

                        <item>Shah went on to berate consortium for its continual maltreatment of
                            Iran, despite Iran's exemplary behavior in comparison with other
                            countries. My efforts to point out that Iran has in fact been treated
                            very well fell on deaf ears. Shah once again contended that consortium
                            is sitting astride Iran's vast reserves and he cannot permit such
                            restraining influences on Iran's welfare.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I pointed out problem is one of marketing. In this connection, I
                            suggested Iran may be trying to carry water on both shoulders, i.e.,
                            pushing consortium to find greater markets while at same time stealing
                            some of consortium's markets, e.g. recent IPAC deal for providing 18,000
                                <gloss target="#t_BPD1">BPD</gloss> to Philippines which previously
                            been almost exclusively market for American majors in consortium. Shah
                            argued such competition is infinitesimal compared with bonanzas greedy
                            oil companies are throwing to countries like Libya. When I pointed out
                            geographic factor which places Libya in favorable situation with Suez
                            closed, Shah said what really infuriates him is companies' lifting large
                            quantities from sheikhdoms like Kuwait and Abu Dhabi when Iran with its
                            26,000,000 people needs funds to maintain its progress and play its role
                            in Mideast security. Shah also asserted that Saudi Arabia's production
                            will soon move up to 4,000,000 barrels per day. Since geographic factor
                            a la Libya cannot be applied vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia, this further
                            demonstrates he said, how companies discriminate against
                            [garble—Libya].</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Shah once again mentioned possibility of legislation which would
                            enable <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to have oil at well-head for
                            clients which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may develop not in
                            competition with consortium. He noted Iraq had long since found
                            companies submissive to such measures. My natural response was to point
                            to Iraq's sorry plight today and how much better off Iran is. I urged
                            Shah “with every bone in my body” not to go down Iraqi road.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>When subject of Iraq first arose, Shah said derisively,
                            “congratulations.” He contended that unhappy developments in Iraq,
                            leading to influx of Soviets into Iraq's oil fields, are primarily due
                            to faulty Western policy over past ten years. Since there was little
                            likelihood of rational discussion, I did not pursue this point further
                            to ascertain what Shah had specifically in mind.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>I told Shah Washington would be appreciative his views re Soviet
                            intrusion in Iraqi oil industry. Shah said much depends on nature of
                            Soviet involvement. However, danger is real, he said, that perhaps with
                            pipeline through Syria, Soviets can get both Iraq and Syria in their
                            clutches, thus leapfrogging over Turkey and Iran. This would place them
                            in dominating position in Mideast, particularly since they already doing
                            so well in what Shah has often mentioned as triangle (it is somewhat
                            linear) of Cairo, Aden-Yemen, and Djibouti.</item>

                            international major. I noted in this connection recent <gloss

                            exported 56 percent of their production, which was 14.6 percent increase

                        <item>This led to general discussion on subject, “whither Mideast oil
                            industry?” I took occasion to express concern that increasing
                            Balkanization of this industry has real dangers for Iran, i.e. fall-off
                            in markets available to consortium and unfortunate if not catastrophic
                            repercussions to oil price structure.</item>

                        <item>Once again I reminded Shah that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s
                            relationship with consortium likely be much more productive if it
                            continues as partnership than if it is coercive. Shah readily agreed but
                            said companies seem only interested in great profits and fail to take
                            into account broader issues such as encouraging a country like Iran
                            which is moving in positive direction and which has potential for

                            added that on any other day he would feel the same way about the oil

                    <p>2704. 1. In opening discussion re arms procurement with Shah 28th, I referred
                        to President's letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">
                            <ref target="#d254">Document 254</ref>.</note> Shah expressed
                        appreciation for warmth of friendship and President's favorable disposition
                        which letter reflected.</p>
                    <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0488"/>
                    <p>2. Shah had President's letter before him and inquired re para which mentions
                        our considering with him economic implications of his proposed military
                        expenditures in light of Congressional views. I noted both Executive Branch
                        and Congress have inherent desire to see developing countries spend less on
                        military hardware and more on economic development. Fortunately, until now
                        Iran's economic progress has been heart-warming and all of us should be
                        interested in keeping it that way.</p>
                    <p>3. When I noted that $800 million projection had come as somewhat of a shock,
                        Shah reverted to his line that rate of expenditure is less than in past
                        three years. He added, however, that if an adequate program could be
                        developed for $600 million or less so much the better.</p>
                    <p>4. Noting that specifics re hardware being covered in <gloss target="#t_HIM1"
                            >HIM</gloss>'s talks with <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                            >Jablonsky</persName>, I said problem is to come up with feasible five
                        year program of procurement. Shah agreed, but said that this should
                        immediately be followed by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> determination
                        as to how much credit it can provide for such program. I pointed out that,
                        given situation in Congress, Shah cannot expect President or <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to make categoric credit commitments that
                        far ahead. As is obvious President's letter, I said, disposition of
                        Executive Branch toward maintaining close military relationship is favorable
                        and Shah would simply have to take chance that Executive Branch can secure
                        Congressional support in years ahead. It was regrettable if Shah might not
                        find it possible to have such patience.</p>
                    <p>5. Shah then came up with idea that after shopping list for next five years
                        has been determined, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could proceed with
                        placing orders, perhaps directly with American companies. If <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit did not eventuate, Iran could secure
                        financing from private American banks. I stressed importance of carefully
                        phased program and re-emphasized point <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                            >Jablonsky</persName> been making that Iran simply unable to find
                        necessary trained personnel for military equipment which Shah has been
                        talking of procuring within next five years. I acknowledged, however, that
                        once practical program been outlined, possibility of credit from private
                        banks is worth consideration. I gathered that Kuss and Samii were already
                        doing some preliminary explorations.</p>
                    <p>6. Shah once again stressed his desire to keep air force American oriented,
                        even if costs are higher, thus, he said, he would not oppose paying extra
                        percentage point or two to private banks in order to continue American
                        procurement for his air force. Shah also hoped that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> could assist by providing personnel to help maintain his
                        air force. Five year package proposal for <persName>McDonnell</persName> to
                        provide maintenance, he noted, estimates cost at $67 million. Thus <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by making military technicians available
                        could be of real help. Comment: While Shah in discussion interest rates
                        talks a bit cavalierly now, there likely to be resentment if and when
                        American commercial credit terms are in fact proposed.</p>
                    <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"/>
                    <p>7. Re tanks, Shah said he goes along with <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1"
                            >Jablonsky</persName>'s proposals for holding density to present M–60's,
                        rehabbed M–47's and eventually 250 Sheridans. Threat to Iran in
                            <persName>Gulf</persName>, he said, is more apt to require naval or air
                        force counter-action than tank action. When I said presumably his naval
                        requirements will be met by British, Shah said there were some items such as
                        ship missiles which he would like from US.</p>
                    <p>8. When Shah referred to argument that Turkey has large tank complement,
                        figures which <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> so helpfully provided in
                        State 90119<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">Dated December 27. (Department of
                            State, Central Files, POL IRAN-U.S.)</note> were given to Shah. It was
                        emphasized that this info was for his personal info only. He was obviously
                        impressed that Turks are not nearly as well off as he had thought.</p>
                    <p>9. When question arose as to possible tank production. Shah once again
                        registered resentment toward Paks. According to Shah, Paks are declining to
                        cooperate in project where British tank factory would be established in Iran
                        to produce tanks for Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran. Pakistani
                        reluctance makes whole project dubious. Shah said that Paks are showing
                        active interest in British proposal for building five-ton tanks in Pakistan.
                        Shah regards such project with great disdain. He described five-ton tanks as
                        useless “mosquitoes.”</p>

                            on private US investment, speaking as he has elsewhere about bad timing
                            of application of these controls to Iran which is only just beginning
                            major effort with US encouragement attract investment in non-oil
                            sectors. He said Iran special case due to recent termination <gloss

                            defense needs, has substantial development program, needs American
                            capital and has unbalanced trade with US favorable to US. Once again
                            saying he not asking for specific action at this time, Ansary asked for
                            special consideration of any problems which may arise.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Rostow stressed we can evaluate effects controls on investment only
                            after we learn from companies of their investment plans within program.
                            We must make clear to speculators and financial community that we mean
                            business. We will watch with greatest possible concern effects of
                            program and within program's limits will attempt facilitate investments
                            companies wish make. He said Iran's and other countries' representations
                            have been well received and convey realities which we wish take into
                            account. If program hurts Iran we will give most sympathetic
                            consideration to Iran's problems at a later point. But this does not
                            necessarily mean we will make changes in program. Rostow added best
                            procedure for taking care of problems which may arise is through
                            arrangements for special licenses if they become possible. He pointed
                            out Iran is in favored category because it can receive <gloss

                    <p>121476. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> asked to see
                        Undersecretary Rostow urgently and alone on February 26. He said he had had
                        a disturbing telephone call from the Shah asking him to come to Switzerland
                        at once for consultations. Two issues were mentioned: a rumor that Americans
                        had been seeing former Prime Minister Amini, and that we had not been
                        neutral, but pro-Saudi, in the median line dispute in the
                            <persName>Gulf</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Rostow saw Ansary again on February 27, after urgent checks. He said the
                        episode was instructive and useful. For him the moral was that the Shah
                        should feel solid confidence in the stability of American policy, despite
                        the sometimes frenetic atmosphere of rumormongering on the part of those who
                        were anxious about their careers or interested in creating difficulties
                        between the United States and Iran. Our policy was clear and simple—it was
                        one of friendship and confidence for the Shah and for Iran. We also had
                        friendly relations with Saudi Arabia and with King
                            <persName>Feisal</persName>, and we hoped that developing cooperation
                        between Iran and Saudi Arabia could become the nucleus for stability and
                        progress in the <persName>Persian Gulf</persName>. In this process,
                        naturally, patient and statesmanlike leadership on the part of the Shah was
                        indispensable.</p>
                    <p>Rostow said that according to the information we had been able to assemble
                        overnight, no American had seen Amini for two years at least, and probably
                        three years. This fact as he knew was contrary to our usual policy of
                        staying in touch with a wide range of opinion. But we were aware of
                        sensitivities between the Shah and Amini, and wished to do nothing to create
                        difficulties for the Shah. There were even rumors in Tehran that I had seen
                        Amini during my recent trip to Tehran.<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">Rostow
                            visited Tehran February 7–9 and met with the Shah. (Telegram 3258 from
                            Tehran, February 9; ibid., POL 7 U.S./Rostow)</note> As he knew, this
                        was nonsense. I had seen a former student, <persName>Parvez
                        Saney</persName>, who called on me at the Embassy when he saw that I was in
                        the city. I told the Shah about the young man, and he said he was interested
                        in hearing his ideas.</p>
                    <p>As for the median line dispute, we had taken exactly the same line in both
                        countries, stating our interest in a peaceful resolution of the conflict,
                        and urging both parties, in the same words, not to take steps that would
                        make it worse. Both Ambassadors were experienced and first-rate men, and had
                        carried out their instructions fully. There were no currents of dissent <pb

                        for the Shah on other subjects. Rostow reviewed the present state of the
                        Jarring mission, and suggested that the Shah might wish at this point to do
                        everything he could, as we and the British are doing, to support
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>, and to urge him not to go to the Security
                        Council on the Jerusalem question. Rostow asked for any suggestions the Shah
                        might have as to what could be done to improve the chances of peace in the
                        Middle East.</p>

                            Furthermore, oil to bloc countries, oil surplus area, would push out oil
                            into consortium sales area and bloc may in any case be within consortium

                            keeping us informed, and b) there is some confusion as to whether <gloss

                            consortium. Eqbal, both in October and in his recent letter, has said
                            that the 5.9 figure applied to consortium only; however Shah told
                                <persName>Bridgeman</persName> in early January, and consortium reps
                            on January 31, that figure includes all oil revenues, and
                                <persName>Fallah</persName> recently said same thing to reps in

                            not yet been honored. He wished to do business with us and he hoped that

                            even unfounded rumors of a change in government, it would be wise for US

                        and rumors. On their face, they are absurd. But what do they mean? We want
                        not simply the factual ammunition required by the situation but your full
                        evaluation of what these demarches represent, and your advice on how they
                        should be handled. Needless to add, we do not take these transparent
                        attempts to drive wedges seriously. But how serious are the suspicions and
                        fears they represent?</p>

                                <item>In casual dinner conversation with General Amini's widow some
                                    time ago possibility of seeing Amini some time was mentioned. If
                                    necessary to take up specifics of these allegations, perhaps you
                                    could say plain fact is we have had no contact with Amini. Given

                                    broader issues. Shortly after my arrival I tried to persuade
                                    Shah, apparently without success, that it is in his interest for
                                    true friends like ourselves to maintain contact with people out
                                    of power. I noted how helpful it had been in Lebanon in bringing
                                    the govt and outsiders together and in preventing explosions. I
                                    made clear to Shah all of this was done with full knowledge and
                                    confidence of President <persName>Chehab</persName>.
                                    Unfortunately traditional Persian disposition is to suspect and
                                    then eliminate, or at least quarantine, any diversity of
                                    thought. Incidentally, one reason for not pursuing this broader
                                    question more recently was our assumption, until present flurry,
                                    that political opposition was insignificant.</item>

                            August's visit to US, coronation panoply, and current economic boom; d)
                            Shah's almost messianic desire to transform Iran into a country as
                            modern as any European during days of power remaining to him; e)
                            sycophantism which tends to inure Shah from reality; f) escalation of
                            inflammation by Foreign Ministry and, in case Amini, perhaps by Prime
                            Minister; g) tendency of <persName>Persian</persName> monarchs to “show
                            their teeth” and success of that tactic in recent devaluation issue with
                            consortium; h) Shah's desire to be world and Mideast leader; i)
                            eagerness of all Iranians from Shah down to prove their “national
                            independence” which here means from the US; j) cover Russian tactics of
                            putting Iranians increasingly on defensive (particularly as prelude to

                            of <persName>Gulf</persName>'s future were gun-boat diplomacy in median
                            line and “showing of teeth” by cancelling Saudi visit. While news of
                            these sallies was carefully managed, many Iranians have reservations,
                            including even some Cabinet ministers. Except from official organs and
                            agents, plaudits to which Shah accustomed not been forthcoming. Although
                            unexpressed, thinking Iranians are questioning government by whim, e.g.
                            one day papers printed letters from heads of Parliament and Senate
                            forswearing pilgrimage and three days later PriMin <persName

                            batch of pilgrims. Inevitably there is some concern about too close an
                            embrace with Soviets. Sharp increase in government budget, especially
                            military, is causing some grumbling as tax collection becomes more
                            strong armed. Meanwhile, presumably for apolitical reasons, strikes are
                            occuring in Iranian universities; they have been disturbingly
                            well-coordinated. This adds to worries of Shah and <gloss

                        <item>Key to US-Iran relationship is, of course, arms supplies. Shah vividly
                            recalls American embargo on arms to Pakistan during latter country's
                            1965 hostilities with India. He must be painfully weighing whether
                            reorientation his arms procurement is practical possibility and if not
                            how he can fashion <persName>Gulf</persName> policy without alienating
                            Americans. Neither option is easy. Beyond military field, Shah realizes
                            cooperation with US commercially and otherwise is sine qua non if Iran
                            is not to become another Finland.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Meanwhile, Shah is in jam with consortium, which provides more than 50
                            percent of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s income, this year
                            around $800 million. Public bravado re intolerability of consortium
                            irresponsiveness necessitates either new consortium concessions, which
                            unlikely, or face-saving exit for Shah. Either way Shah will wish <gloss

                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>How foregoing analysis reduces to Shah's suspicions of American
                            collusion with Amini only <persName>Byzantine</persName>, or perhaps
                                <persName>Persian</persName>, mind can fathom. Certainly, one
                            explanation is that best defense is good offense. Shah's remonstrances
                            through <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> are in other words
                            tactical, i.e. rationalization to US and to himself for actions he has
                            recently taken, and for actions he may take in near future; also a
                            pressure tactic on US vis-à-vis his problems such as arms, consortium

                        <item>Perhaps silver lining is that Shah is coming to grips with reality. He
                            is generating his own turbulence, which is preferable to our doing it.
                            Situation is, of course, very delicate and our job is to deter Shah from

                            production. Should also point out that while Iraq is now increasing
                            production their demagogic tactics, e.g. unilateral legislation and

                            Shah's deeper concerns may be more difficult. Big challenge is to

                        would naturally like to drop in for a short chat with you.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d266fn2">In telegram 3437 from Tehran, February 21, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> had reported that the Shah had
                            decided to accept the invitation to receive an honorary degree at the
                            Harvard commencement, and that Court Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_AA11">Alam</persName> had expressed the belief that the
                            Shah would also want to meet with the President. (Department of State,

                            <persName>Persian Gulf</persName> now a certainty, he will want to stay
                        in close touch with you, and we have an interest in his cooperation with his
                        Arab neighbors to prevent an undue increase in Soviet or Arab radical
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommends that you
                        invite the Shah to an office meeting and a small working lunch either June
                        12 (Wednesday) or 14 (Friday) so he can stop in on his way to or from
                        Cambridge. We realize you just had him for a more formal visit last August
                        and would not have recommended another meeting so soon. But since he's
                        coming on a private invitation for a laudable purpose, it's hard not to pay
                        him some attention.</p>
                    <p>An additional reason for the meeting is that, as you know, we maintain our
                        relationship with the Shah via periodic contact of this sort—more frequent
                        than is normal in other cases. Right now he is having another periodic case
                        of annoyance and nervousness over some serious problems and decisions he
                        faces.</p>
                    <p>In short, he's at another point of needing reassurance that he can count on
                        us. He isn't getting what he wants from the oil companies; the British are
                        vacating the <persName>Gulf</persName> leaving him face to face in a dispute
                        with Saudi Arabia over tremendous oil reserves under the <persName>Persian
                            Gulf</persName>; his military sales agreement with us is pending;
                            <persName>Kosygin</persName> is coming in April, and the Communist
                        clandestine radio is raking him over and appealing to his opposition; he's
                        not doing too well with the Arabs, and he may be feeling generally isolated
                        at the moment.</p>
                    <p>Your schedule would permit an office chat and small lunch on either June 12
                        or 14.<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">Approved for June 12.</note>

                    <p>126616. 1. Rostow called in <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName>
                        March 7 and made following points:</p>
                    <p>2. In the nature of the relationship of confidence and trust between our two
                        countries and the respect and admiration we feel for the Shah, it is
                        gratifying and right that we clear away any doubts, misunderstandings or
                        suspicions that may arise between us. It is natural, given the complexity of
                        some of the problems we face together, that such misunderstandings can arise
                        from time to time. We appreciate the spirit that led Shah to ask the
                        Ambassador to raise with us the problems we discussed at our last
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>3. We have rechecked the points raised. We are glad to assure the Shah that
                        so far as we can find out from all sources there is no substance to any of
                        the rumors that have been given us. No one at the Embassy has been in
                        contact with Amini, nor has any American connected with other official
                        groups. It is true that the possibility of a social meeting with Amini was
                        mentioned at a dinner party some time ago, but it was not followed up. From
                        the point of view of our normal diplomatic policy, as the Ambassador knows,
                        we would see such meetings as normal. The problem of contacts has been fully
                        and amicably discussed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName> with the Shah. If you have more concrete evidence, we
                        should be glad to consider it. But it is hard to check on vague and general
                        rumors.</p>
                    <p>4. Any contacts Embassy officers or other officials have had with students,
                        through Student Center at university or otherwise, have been most casual and
                        normal. The idea of Americans being involved in any way in student movements
                        or demonstrations is fantastic, and has no foundation.</p>
                    <p>5. With regard to the cancellation of the Shah's visit to King
                            <persName>Feisal</persName>, our views were thoroughly and frankly
                        discussed with the Shah. While we were somewhat disappointed, we understood
                        his decision, and there was no criticism of it. We did not discuss our views
                        in public, or outside a very tight circle in the government.</p>
                    <p>6. On broader issues, Rostow said he had been unable to detect any rebels
                        against the President's policy. In every agency, and at every level, there
                        was a unanimity remarkable in the American government, and not very typical
                        of the American mind—a unanimity of enthusiasm for what <pb n="478"
                            xml:id="pg_478" facs="0506"/>Iran is accomplishing, and of confidence in
                        the Shah's leadership, at home and abroad—in the <persName>Persian
                            Gulf</persName>, in the Middle East, and in world affairs.</p>
                    <p>7. On oil questions, we have indeed been neutral. The Saudis think we favor
                        Iran. Our efforts with the Consortium have been addressed to facilitating
                        clearer understanding and good will on both sides. The Consortium has made
                        major concessions to Iran in past two years, and their performance over the
                        last 15 years has been spectacular, and has helped make possible the Shah's
                        program of economic and social development. So far as Iraq is concerned,
                        their behavior over the years has reduced both investment and their share in
                        production.</p>
                    <p>8. With regard to the arms supply problem, Rostow said he had checked on the
                        status of plans. Draft military agreement had not been sent to Embassy some
                        time ago. Nothing more than an uncleared sketch had been received. But a
                        directive has now been issued to have the entire matter prepared for action
                        very quickly. Ways and means of financing the transaction are being studied.
                        We have every reason to expect an answer within a short period. We must of
                        course bear in mind the history of Congressional interest in arms sales
                        generally.</p>
                    <p>9. About the <persName>Gulf</persName>, we stand ready to examine problems of
                        cooperation and stabilization in that vital area with <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, here and in Tehran. We realize the
                        sensitivity and importance of the issues involved, and will do our best to
                        facilitate their solution. The problems of the <persName>Gulf</persName> are
                        of critical importance. The latest Soviet statement on the subject is
                        serious. It asserts that our interest in the safety of the region is
                        directed against the security of the southern borders of the Soviet Union.
                        It endorses national liberation movements in the area, and attacks
                        “imperialist and neocolonialist regimes.” And it offers Soviet protection to
                        the governments of the area in order to safeguard them against imperialist
                        encroachments. Rostow said there was no need to stress the implications of
                        this bold public statement, as published in Pravda on March 4.</p>
                    <p>10. Our government is unanimous in its admiration of and respect for our
                        Ambassador. He has been doing an extraordinary job. Ansary warmly and
                        enthusiastically agreed and said he knew Shah had great confidence in
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>. Rostow said we were
                        glad to be assured by the Ambassador that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> enjoys the confidence of the Shah. We
                        believe that confidence is fully merited. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> presents the Iranian viewpoint to us
                        with great force and understanding. We are glad there is no misunderstanding
                        between us on this point. Rumors of this kind would normally be cleared up
                        in frank talks with the Ambassador in Tehran, and we are sure this practice
                        will continue to be the rule when the Shah returns to his capital. Ansary
                        agreed with Rostow that undoubtedly reason why these issues were raised in
                        Washington rather than Tehran at this time was their sensitivity. In view of
                            <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0507"/>probable sources of reports, it
                        would have been difficult for Shah to handle problem by cable to Tehran.</p>

                            was directed at British. He refuses accept their non-responsibility for
                            creation of <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>. He has reached
                            conclusion that Bahrein's inclusion in <gloss target="#t_FAA1"
                                >FAA</gloss>, plus implication that British will deliver Tunb
                            Islands and Abu Musa to sheikhdoms, is intolerable. Shah said he waiting
                            to hear from British following Zahedi's talks. He considers Brenchley as
                            chief HMG culprit with <persName>George Brown</persName> not far behind.
                            If British, who are allegedlly allies, persist in present course, Shah
                            said, Iran will not sit at same table with them, e.g. <gloss

                                suggested formula for dissolving Iran's claim to Bahrein, i.e.,
                                plebiscite, but that would not be possible now given present
                                excitement on Bahrein question. If issue could be put in ice-box for
                                two years, plebiscite might be possible then. I noted Sheikh of

                            <p>3 <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi>. Oil Consortium. Shah seemed
                                relatively relaxed re consortium. He has impression consortium will
                                meet his demands for 1968 or gap will be so narrowed that it
                                acceptable. Problem is oil income for remaining four years of fourth
                                plan. Shah concentrated particularly on inter-participants
                                agreement, proudly reporting that through various sources he has
                                received secret info re attitudes of various companies. He repeated
                                what we had heard from consortium reps, that previously internal
                                regulations “absolutely impossible” but now they merely
                                “impossible.” He believes obstructive underlifting companies are
                                concerned that overlifters might steal some of their markets. Shah
                                believes underlifters can be mollified by setting limit, e.g., 15
                                percent as to how much overlifting oil hungry companies, e.g.,
                                Iricon, will be allowed to take if and when restrictions can be
                                loosened further. I pointed out what one rep had told me that
                                obviously oil hungry companies will say revised regulations are
                                still prohibitive so long as they think further liberalization is
                                possible. Also went to considerable lengths to suggest offers by
                                East Bloc and <gloss target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> have ulterior
                                motives, i.e. shaking the normal oil industry in Mideast for their
                                own political and economic benefit. Cited phony Hungarian report
                                against Mobil, and fact that as soon as Shah got special price to
                                barter oil to Romania and other East Bloc countries Romanians raced
                                to Saudi Arabia, Libya, Egypt and other oil producing companies
                                offering barter deals for oil—with none of them, including deals
                                with Iran, resulting as yet in moving one drop of oil to East Bloc.
                                Re Mobil, Shah said Iran can not object to consortium companies
                                trying to sell additional oil including in East Bloc but it does
                                object if an <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> price is
                                undercut. Shah said in Washington Zahedi will make point that
                                Iranian liftings only 130 million tons per year while Arab states
                                moving around 600 million, but West would be well advised to work
                                toward better balance in view of uncertainty of Arab behavior.</p>

                            broadcasts, Soviet diplomatic demarche etc., Shah said it is “clear as

                            Mideast oil. Soviet system has failed in competition with West, Shah
                            said, and world war is out of question for them, so they trying to
                            dominate Mideast and its oil as means for destroying West European
                            industry and thereby systems of government. Shah said he has ordered
                            Zahedi to have Iranian diplomats in Western Europe emphasize this

                        <item>U.S. Collusion. Began conversation by expressing gratification that
                            small irritants which had been mentioned by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> to Under Secretary Rostow been
                            cleared away and mutual confidence fully restored, including with this
                            Embassy. Shah still thinks we side with Saudi Arabia but only because of
                            his partisan evaluation of events leading up to cancellation of Saudi
                            visit. As I was leaving he mentioned Amini and I reviewed details, also
                            my conviction that our being in touch with outsiders is to his
                            advantage. Cited how well this worked when I was in Lebanon, also how
                            helpful it was (and he agreed) when I took on Iranian students across
                            from Blair House last August. He then professed there no objection to
                            our seeing even Amini “every night” (but of course he does not mean it).
                            Shah (as <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> had done before)
                            said what caused concern was coincidence of events, e.g. student unrest,
                            Amini's increased activity, etc., which resembled developments in 1961
                            prior to Amini's coming to power. His view now is that student unrest
                            was definitely Communist inspired and other disturbing events also had
                            nothing to do with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Conversation
                            ended most amicably with Shah jokingly agreeing I not persona non

                                    Iran's helpfulness in keeping its oil available during last
                                    June's crisis. He asked whether it wise for oil companies depend
                                    so heavily on Arab oil and on Aden refinery. Iran thought that
                                    alliance and friendship with US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                        >UK</gloss>, actions in June crisis, and constructive
                                    attitude on many international problems would have resulted in
                                    different response. Iran doesn't wish put oil companies in
                                    corner and threaten them and is open to suggestions. Consortium
                                    has been told what Iran's requirements are and has been asked
                                    raise offtake and/or provide cost oil for Iran to market and/or
                                    invest in Iran. If Consortium unable respond, it must think of

                        <item>In response Secretary said he hesitated give off-the-cuff response to
                            such serious and far-reaching problems. He mentioned number of world
                            problems, including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, Korea,
                            stirrings in Eastern Europe, economic situation in Free World. He noted
                            that following June war Soviets felt sense of panic and loss of
                            prestige. Stresses in Communist world and judgments they make concerning
                            Free World produce situation pregnant with possibilities of crisis.
                            Secretary said hard for us think about problems <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZA5">Zahedi</persName> raised except in framework world
                            situation. We would be disturbed if Iran and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> at odds. Would be serious if Iranian actions would
                            create inflammation in Arab world against Iran causing Arabs to look to
                            Soviets for assistance. He expressed understanding how serious these
                            problems are for Iran but stated they also grave in terms total world
                            situation. It would be easy, he said, for US to counsel patience, but
                            instead we ask Iran examine all consequences and alternatives in current
                            dangerous world situations where clarity and wisdom in high demand.
                            Secretary reviewed our strenuous efforts dissuade British from early
                            withdrawal from <persName>Gulf</persName>. He mentioned knowledge some
                            Iranians feel we not neutral in Iranian-Saudi problems and assured
                            Zahedi this not so and that in fact we believe good Iranian-Saudi
                            relations prerequisite to peace in <persName>Gulf</persName> and that
                            they have identity of interest in preventing expansion Soviet influence
                            in area. He said we deeply concerned about any match being applied to
                            gunpowder anywhere. Shah one of best informed men in world and also wise
                            man. <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0512"/>Hopefully Iran would look
                            at its problems in widest context. Secretary concluded by saying he
                            could not speak from Mount Olympus and hoped discussions these subjects
                            would continue through Ambassadors.</item>

                        <item>On oil, Secretary said we cannot dictate to companies. We hope both
                            parties will continue to promote their mutually beneficial relations. We
                            will keep in touch with companies. Rostow mentioned our strong interest
                            in mutually satisfactory solution and asked if Iranians had discussed

                    <p>There has been student unrest. It started because of difficulties with
                        university administrators and the political content has been low.</p>
                    <p>There was a teacher's strike, but as far as anyone knows, pay was the only
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>The Iranian government is worried about former Prime Minister Amini's
                        activities, but we are unaware that he has done anything, and there is no
                        indication that he is involved with the mullahs.</p>
                    <p>Many of the mullahs have always been anti-Shah, but there doesn't appear to
                        be any unusual activity.</p>

                    <p>The Iranians are having trouble with the oil consortium, but no one has
                        discovered any tie between the oil companies and either Amini or the
                        mullahs.</p>
                    <p>The odds are that <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName>—and probably
                        the Shah—have, in typical Iranian fashion, combined a few unrelated events,
                        some rumors and their own unfounded suspicions into a conspiracy. They had
                        suspected the U.S. Government was involved, and, despite what <persName

                        Meyer, our protestations of innocence are unlikely to have convinced them
                        completely. But <persName>Armin</persName>'s latest audience with the Shah
                        suggests that we've quieted suspicions for the moment.</p>
                    <p>The best explanation of all this Iranian edginess is
                            <persName>Armin</persName> Meyer's guess as to why the Shah called his
                        ambassador to meet him in Switzerland and then had the ambassador bring back
                        a bag full of crazy charges against <persName>Armin</persName>. If you
                        haven't seen this, it's worth your time as background eventually for the

                        <item>Some concern was voiced in <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> meeting
                            particularly as to implications of any kind of “commitment” for 5-year
                            period following 1968. Possible that <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>
                            may decide some further study required, e.g., on <pb n="486"

                            of this magnitude. In that event, possible that final <gloss

                            be delayed for some time which we can now not precisely estimate. Could
                            be as much as several weeks. Given that contingency, I would appreciate
                            your personal views on desirability your presenting Shah in near future
                            firm <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> offer regarding $100 million

                    </list>
                    <p>On mulling over our discussion of the military threat to Iran, I should like
                        to come back to one major point. You said several times you could not find
                        anybody around the room who challenged the military justification for the
                        package. I wish now that I had, because I feel that a basic challenge was
                        implicit in everything that was said. For instance: <list>
                            <item>—Stuart <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> led off by
                                saying quite accurately that what we are coping with here is the
                                Shah's assessment of what he needs. This political reality is our
                                central problem.</item>
                            <item>—<persName>Harry Schwartz</persName>, when you asked him to
                                discuss the specific questions of Iranian absorptive capacity and
                                the like, said quite frankly that he could not provide this kind of
                                justification for the package. As I understood <pb n="487"
                                    xml:id="pg_487" facs="0515"/>him, he said that the package is
                                the sum of a lot of elements—the Shah's assessments of his needs,
                                our assessment of what he can afford, our estimate of what we can
                                afford, our estimate of what Congress will stand for, etc. But
                                nowhere did I hear him say anything about the kinds of wars he might
                                have to fight with the Arabs—<persName>Harry</persName> excluded the
                                Soviet threat—and the specific kinds of equipment he'd need to fight
                                those wars.</item>
                            <item>—<persName>Jim Critchfield</persName>'s eloquent description of
                                the threat was largely a description of the world as the Shah sees
                                it emerging. This is valid, and we have to cope with it. But there
                                was no intelligence estimate, such as we are striving for on the
                                    Israeli-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> front, that the
                                Iranians could defeat the Iraqis in five days, that the balance
                                between Syria-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Iraq and Iran
                                would tip in the radicals' favor by January 1970 or any of the other
                                measurable dangers one might conceive if one tried to war-game the
                                threat against Iran precisely.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>In short, while there was some side-talk about naval needs, no one at the
                        meeting challenged the military element of the package. Someone said that
                        the Shah's main objective is to be so strong as to deter attack, but we
                        didn't take the next logical step to admit that there really isn't a pure
                        military justification.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">A handwritten notation
                            next to this sentence reads: “none.”</note> While no one challenged,
                        nobody really justified either. What we have done is started with the Shah's
                        first bargaining shot of $800 million and squeezed the most obvious
                        bargaining components out of that package. Now we have reached a hard
                        collection of items that the Shah says he needs.</p>
                    <p>Like you, I don't question for a moment the political rationale for the
                        program, but I think we ought to be quite candid with ourselves in admitting
                        that the political rationale is also pretty much the military rationale.
                        Unquestionably, the Shah needs some modernization, and I'm sure General
                            <persName corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName> must have some
                        military rationale, but it hasn't surfaced in the <gloss target="#t_IRG1"
                            >IRG</gloss>. You'll recall that no one argued against your 5–7 year
                        idea on military grounds at all. All of the arguments were related to
                        “reliability“, bargaining, Congress, etc.</p>
                    <p>I'm not sure that it is possible to be more precise on the military side,
                        although I think there may be some virtue in trying. The economic problems
                        which <persName>Maury Williams</persName> mentioned are much more measurable
                        and do warrant a real review. But if in the course of the next two weeks, no
                        one in the Pentagon can give us a military picture comparable to the
                        economic one, I think we ought to reduce the military aspects of this
                        problem to the political question of how far we can safely bargain the Shah
                        down.</p>

                        <item>Given unhappy addition of Persian Gulf to many frustrations which are
                            confronting our country these days, I am not surprised that some concern
                            being voiced by our <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> colleagues re
                            proceeding with military credit sales program of Iran. Frankly, these
                            concerns are shared here at Embassy. However, after weighing all
                            factors, we continue convinced we have no choice but to proceed with
                            program promptly, if we are to retain healthy friendship with Iran and
                            if we are to maintain effective influence not only on Shah's armament
                            but on key role which he will inevitably play in Gulf.</item>

                            frictions which so quickly erupted. No doubt we shall witness more, but
                            despite stridency which has characterized some of Shah's initial
                            sallies, I definitely sense restraining effect which our influence has

                        <item>A few straws in the wind. Shah is actively interested in rescheduling
                            Saudi visit and Foreign Ministry is going out of its way to keep us
                            posted. Reasonably effective Kuwait-Iran dialogue continues. Shah has
                            reiterated instructions to IPAC to desist from drilling F–7. Admiral
                                <persName>Rasai</persName> has told General <persName

                            years our record has not been without success. During past two years we
                            dissuaded Shah from: two additional squadrons of F–5's, all <pb n="489"
                                xml:id="pg_489" facs="0517"/>Hawk missiles (he wanted three
                            battalions), costly Vulcan anti-aircraft, etc. More recently we have
                            reduced his estimate of additional needs for next five years from $800
                            to $500 million; we have cut tank program from 1,500 to under 1,000
                            including holding on to OLM M–47's; we have again talked him out of
                            land-based surface-to-surface missile system; we have reduced his desire
                            for self-propelled Howitzers from 222 to 50; etc. In general, we have
                            succeeded in shaping his program to scope below armament levels of his
                            neighbors, notably his potential enemies who are being heavily supplied
                            by Soviets (Arabs have <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s, bombers,

                        <item>Three weeks ago Shah suspected that US-Iranian military relationship,
                            which he so much values, was on verge of rupture. His concern was
                            prompted by reports that this Embassy was interdicting draft five-year
                            agreement. Thanks to masterful endeavors of Under Secretary Rostow,
                            Shah's irrational reaction was mollified. Both General <persName
                                corresp="#p_JMGHJ1">Jablonsky</persName> and I have found Shah on
                            his return to be relatively relaxed, confident in faithfulness of his
                            American friends. Make no mistake about it, however, Shah expects early
                            positive decision.</item>

                        <item>If as <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> implies we are now to
                            suggest, no matter how indirectly, that new hitch has developed in trust
                            which Shah has placed in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                            consequences are apt to be quite seismic. While Shah may have undue
                            preoccupation with things military, he is probably most serious and
                            realistic leader in all Middle East. As he sees it, vacuum which will be
                            created in Gulf with departure of British cannot remain so. He prefers
                            full collaboration with Saudis and other riparian regimes, but
                            realistically assessing their capability as minimal and their longevity
                            as questionable, he will assuredly prepare Iran for its role, hopefully
                            in harmony with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> but if necessary
                            alone. Thought of Russian-backed Arab radicals in Gulf is intolerable to

                        <item>Shah is only too conscious of leverage which his purchasing US arms
                            provides US. Most electrifying moment during my three years here was
                            when at height of Indo-Pakistani hostilities Shah learned firmly from me
                            that no Iranian arms could go to Pakistan, which was already suffering
                            from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> arms embargo. Pakistan's plight
                            made indelible impression on Shah. Fact that he is still prepared to do
                            most of his arms business with US, knowing the restrictions to which he
                            becomes committed, is in itself testimony to his wanting to play game
                            our way.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>During past weeks, I have carefully not threatened Shah. To do so
                            could easily precipitate irrational reactions. At same time, I have
                            assured through several intermediaries—e.g., Alam, Hoveyda, Samii,
                            Afshar—that Shah is cognizant of fact that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> will not fuel hostilities between Iran and its
                            trans-Gulf Arab neighbors. I am sure Shah has this message and that this
                            is responsible for restraints noted in para 3 (as well as his
                            crotchetiness while he was in Switzerland). Meanwhile, same message <pb

                                >Hoveyda</persName> I led off with point that basic assumption for
                            our discussion must be that “stability” presently characterizing this
                            country and Gulf region would continue.</item>

                        <item>In our view, it is far better to preserve our conditioning influence
                            in foregoing positive way than by negative threats, strings and
                            hesitancies which can only offend Iranian sensitivities and defeat our
                            purposes. Shah can easily be driven to other suppliers, and wide
                            diversification of his arms sources is costly, e.g., increased expense
                            caused by influx of Soviet arms. Buying helter-skelter (we favor some
                            diversification to Western sources) multiplies wastefully the drain on
                            Iran's economic resources.</item>

                            precipitated his kicking over traces by making first arms purchases from
                            Soviets. <persName>Kosygin</persName> is coming and undoubtedly will be
                            making syrupy new offers. As long as Shah remains optimistic re American
                            cooperation, we doubt Soviet offers will receive markedly affirmative
                            response.</item>

                            given critical nature of latter problem for us I wonder re wisdom of
                            rejecting $100,000,000 per year income which is certain to go elsewhere,

                    </list>
                    <p>The Shah's personal rule of Iran is probably more secure now than at any time
                        since he succeeded to the throne in 1940, and a primary reason for this is
                        his conscious avowal of nationalistic policies during the last six years.
                        This paper examines the policies followed during that period and estimates
                        the degree of success achieved by the Shah in his search for support for his
                        program of “positive nationalism.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In 1962 the Shah formulated a six point reform program which has been
                        broadened since then to twelve points, some of them very extensive <pb
                            n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0520"/>in scope. These reforms define the
                        Shah's concept of “positive nationalism” and are intended to gain the
                        support of Iranians for the Shah's regime while cutting the ground from
                        under any opposition groups which might seek support openly or
                        clandestinely. The reforms are also intended to give the Shah the image of a
                        modernizer in foreign countries. Although the reform program is by no means
                        complete, it has already accomplished some of the goals the Shah set for
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In Iran's dealings with the Western oil Consortium, the Shah has cultivated
                        the image of a nationalist hero fighting against foreign exploitation and
                        has striven to succeed the late Mosadeq in that role. Since about 1962 Iran
                        has gradually moved to downplay its ties with the West and to establish an
                        independent foreign policy. The Shah has visited seven Communist countries
                        in the last three years. This period has enabled the Shah to stress the
                        benefits to Iran of his “positive nationalism“, and the coronation of
                        October 1967 symbolized and highlighted his accomplishments. The coronation
                        also demonstrated the Shah's resolve to provide for continuation of the
                        Pahlavi dynasty and played up the cultural heritage of Iran. The Shah's
                        determination to provide a strong defense in the Persian Gulf to back up
                        Iran's involvement in the area has been publicized as a national mission,
                        and there is a danger that a serious oil dispute in the Gulf or a clash
                        between Arab and Iranian residents of Bahrein (which Iran claims and which
                        is to be a member of the prospective Federation of Arab Amirates) could
                        prompt the Shah to involve Iranian forces to protect Iran's national
                        honor.</p>
                    <p>Despite growing prosperity and dwindling opposition activity the Shah has not
                        permitted Iranians to involve themselves in free political activity on an
                        organized basis. The New Iran Party, established in 1963, soon lost its
                        pretension of representative political activity and became simply a creature
                        of the government in power. Opposition parties have been persecuted and in
                        turn weakened by internal dissension over what reaction they should have
                        made to the persecution. The Shah seems to have made a conscious decision to
                        emphasize the pursuit of higher standards of living in order to keep Iranian
                        minds off any movement to secure participation in the political process. If
                        the current campaign against former Prime Minister Amini is any indication,
                        political criticism may be subject to attack in the future as a threat to
                        Iran's material prosperity. Perhaps the Shah will allow limited political
                        participation when he feels he has gained broad support of the people.</p>
                    <p>The Shah has been able to remove from his regime the stigma of being
                        subservient to the West, and the opposition no longer has a monopoly on
                        nationalism. There is little doubt that the Shah's position has been
                        strengthened. The greatest weaknesses of his regime are probably the
                        continued rift between it and most intellectuals, and the fact that the
                        government is highly personal, with the Shah in the central role. Removal of
                            <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0521"/>the Shah from political life
                        would probably cause a major crisis and might seriously affect Iran's
                        stability.</p>

                    <p>138990. 1. In a meeting with top executives of Esso, Mobil, Standard Oil of
                        California, Texaco, Gulf and Iricon (morning March 28) Undersec Rostow said
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wished to have candid exchange of
                        views with them about Iranian oil negotiations in their full political
                        context. We did not wish to cross the delicate line between political and
                        commercial considerations nor did we wish to take responsibility for the
                        negotiations. But there was a deep national interest in a mutually
                        satisfactory outcome for the negotiations at this time. The Consortium came
                        into being with special anti-trust and other privileges by reason of such
                        political considerations. He wished to discuss directly with the responsible
                        leadership of the companies the political factors we saw impinging on the
                        negotiating process.</p>
                    <p>So far as the Persian Gulf was concerned, we faced a national security
                        problem in view of the British withdrawal, and the risk of penetration of
                        weak Gulf States by movements of radical Arab nationalism, as well as by
                        more direct Soviet interventions. In that perspective, Iran was the keystone
                        of American plans. We wished to have equal friendship with Iran and with
                        Saudi Arabia, and close cooperation between them. At this point, Iran was
                        clearly the stronger partner, progressive and developing. But Saudi
                        cooperation with Iran was indispensable from every point of view, political,
                        psychological and geographic, if stability in the Persian Gulf was to be
                        assured. Rostow reviewed recent history and present prospects of efforts to
                        bring Shah and <persName>Feisal</persName> together, and stressed importance
                        of an oil settlement compatible with the necessities of that process.</p>
                    <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0522"/>
                    <p>But Persian Gulf problem was intimately linked to Middle East crisis as a
                        whole. After reporting on problems of M.E. since Nov. 22 S.C. Resolution,
                        Rostow said we regarded the situation as increasingly grave. <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was blocking progress on the Jarring
                        Mission. And Syria—perhaps <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as well—was
                        training and sending out terrorists on a very dangerous scale. Jordan had a
                        Vietcong on its territory, as Laos does, and could no longer control it. In
                        the absence of peace negotiations, Israeli reprisals were inevitable,
                        despite our urgent efforts to prevent them. As a result, there was a serious
                        possibility of renewed general hostilities in the Middle East, with
                        incalculable potentialities. We were working on a crisis footing to head off
                        hostilities, but we could not be sure of the outcome.</p>
                    <p>2. Rostow referred to Shah's statements that he cooperated with West at his
                        great risk during crisis last June. If he felt this cooperation not
                        recognized through favorable treatment by Consortium, there was possibility
                        he would not cooperate with West in new crisis. Rostow also said withdrawal
                        of British from area made it necessary for Iran to cooperate with Arabs in
                        Gulf and in a new round of hostilities he might not be willing risk their
                        wrath by breaking Arab blockade again. As companies knew, even temporary
                        boycott of Middle East oil, if it included Iranian production, would be
                        catastrophic.</p>
                    <p>3. Iran, he said, has written $5.9 billion into its development plan and Shah
                        would not change it. We know companies cannot give Iran all it wants for its
                        plan but we also believe that if there is some increase in earlier estimates
                        there will be chance of averting confrontation and new crisis in Iran this
                        year.</p>
                    <p>4. Rostow asked without prejudice about possibility of investment
                        commitments, raising <gloss target="#t_APQ1">APQ</gloss>, altering over-lift
                        arrangements to permit crude-hungry companies to take more oil, on equitable
                        terms, increasing refinery throughput, and making special allowances for
                        British Petroleum if it decided to reduce Abu Dhabi production in favor of
                        Iran. Desirability of equality of treatment between Iran and Saudi Arabia
                        was stressed, and generally accepted. Companies said they are examining all
                        these possibilities and said all offered some room for adjustment but they
                        gave no definite assurances on any.</p>
                    <p>5. They pointed to certainty more favorable treatment Iran would result
                        immediate demands from Arab and other producing countries which they could
                        not meet. In reference this as well as to willingness French other “oil
                        hungry” companies to take more cost oil, they said such oil could only be
                        sold at expense current marketing since demand was being fully met. Rostow
                        said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> recognized all alternatives were
                        impossible, but we would weigh the political value of a settlement with Iran
                        very highly.</p>
                    <p>6. Companies asked <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attempt convince Iran
                        that Consortium trying help it meet development goals. Rostow said we had
                        done this repeatedly <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0523"/>and would do
                        so again, if companies assured us they would make genuine effort to reach
                        satisfactory agreement. This assurance was given. To be effective, companies
                        would probably have to improve their estimates and do everything
                        economically feasible to help Iran. Companies said they knew any approach
                        would have to be on this basis.</p>
                    <p>7. At end of meeting question was asked whether <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> seriously thought risk of confrontation, and of rash and
                        destructive action by Shah, was high. Rostow answered affirmatively, and
                        said our concern over this risk was the subject matter of meeting, and the
                        reason it was called.</p>
                    <p>8. Company position throughout meeting was neither hostile or negative and we
                        believe they will endeavour seriously to devise new offer before April 20.
                        Clearly any new offer will be below Iranian demands but we hope enough will
                        be offered to avert crisis this year.</p>

                            McCloy received impression Shah more interested in mid-Gulf islands than
                            Bahrein. Shah claimed islands are Persian and for British to turn them
                            over to amirs would be “affront.” Stressing <persName>Faisal</persName>
                            is his friend, Shah gave impression his irritations directed more at

                            commitments with devastating effect worldwide. Shah urged there be no

                            reminded Shah Iran is big progressive country and Shah a respected
                            leader who could afford to be big in dealing with his neighbors. Shah
                            contended political concessions are difficult if he is to retain respect

                        <hi rend="italic">Political Factors</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_IRG1"
                            >IRG</gloss> agreed that our arms supply relationship has a vital
                        importance in our overall ties with Iran, and that—given the Shah's great
                        concern over Iran's security problems—our response to the Shah's current
                        request for arms sales in the years immediately ahead will have a decisive
                        influence on the pattern of our overall relationship with Iran for the next
                        several years. The benefits of our relationship with Iran run the gamut from
                        valuable collaboration with our own military and intelligence endeavors
                        based in Iran, to the intangibles of friendly cooperation of an ally on the
                        international scene. Although the Shah has desired to evince a greater
                        degree of “independence” in his foreign policy and has taken steps to
                        improve Iran's relationship with the U.S.S.R., Iran remains a loyal
                        supporter of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, retains a realistic
                        awareness of long-range Soviet intentions, and has made it clear it wishes
                        to keep its close ties with the United States. It was noted that our
                        relationship with Iran assumes added importance in light of the increased
                        Soviet threat in the Middle East and the continuing instability in the Arab
                        world. The Shah is concerned over the implications of strong Soviet support
                        for the radical Arab states, with whom he sees Iran potentially in conflict.
                        It was noted that the forthcoming British withdrawal east of Suez will
                        enhance Iran's importance in future developments in the Persian Gulf area,
                        in which the United States has key strategic and economic interests.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Military Factors</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> member cited various recent developments which have
                        affected the Shah's view of Iranian security problems and which have
                        impelled him to modernize and strengthen Iran's security forces. These
                        developments include the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s supply of
                        the radical Arab states with modern weapons; the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>'s announced withdrawal from the Persian Gulf by 1971;
                        increased Soviet naval activity in the Mediterranean, and the assumption
                        that the Soviets will seek to extend their influence as broadly as possible
                        east of Suez; the pressure on existing US military forces in connection with
                        the situation in Southeast Asia and the Shah's probable concern as to our
                        ability and willingness to provide rapid support to Iran in the event of an
                        external aggression.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> member noted that Iran must orient a
                        large portion of its military defense against the potential Soviet threat,
                        although no Soviet military action against Iran is foreseen in the years
                        immediately ahead. The Shah's major external security concern is for the
                        threat posed by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and other radical
                        Arab nationalists to the oil-rich Khuzistan area. <pb n="498"
                            xml:id="pg_498" facs="0526"/>The Shah is anxious to procure sufficient
                        air defense aircraft, antiaircraft and naval equipment to counter a
                        potential <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>/Iraqi air and naval threat to southeast Iran and the
                        Persian Gulf. His reorganization of the Iranian Ground Forces, with greater
                        emphasis on armor and mobility, stems from the size of his country and the
                        diversity of the current threat in general—in particular the tank threat
                        posed by a potentially hostile Iraq.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> agreed that it was impossible to
                        relate any projected level of arms supply precisely to any given threat or
                        combination of threats. It is uncertain, for example, to what extent radical
                        Arab forces constitute a real military threat; what combination of radical
                        Arab forces might threaten Iran; and just what military capability Iran
                        would require, at a given time, to counter such a threat. These questions
                        involve both quantitative and qualitative issues. Recognizing these
                        uncertainties, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> member concluded
                        nevertheless that Iran needs solid US support, in the form of modern arms
                        and equipment and appropriate military training and advice, in order
                        effectively to deter or defend against potential military action by radical
                        Arab forces.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> member noted that the currently
                        proposed program for modernizing and building up Iran's military
                        establishment over the next half-decade has been developed in close
                        consultation by the Chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group and
                        Iranian authorities. Iran's ability to absorb the equipment in question was
                        implicit in the development of the program. In summary, the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> member stated, the program made sense from
                        a military viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Economic Factors</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_IRG1"
                            >IRG</gloss> devoted considerable attention to the question of Iran's
                        economic situation and its ability to finance a major program of military
                        reinforcement. It noted Iran's impressive record of an 8–9% annual economic
                        growth in real terms in the last three years in a climate of price
                        stability. Rising oil revenues have permitted a steady increase in
                        expenditure for economic development as well as for defense. It noted that
                        Iran's new Five Year Development Plan, which went into operation on March
                        21, 1968, aims at increasing <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> at an
                        average annual rate of 9.3%. This Plan foresees a rise in the proportion of
                        fixed public and private investment to <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>
                        from 21% in 1967 to 25.3% over the 5-year period.</p>
                    <p>The members <hi rend="italic">agreed</hi>, however, that many uncertainties
                        and intangibles make it impossible to predict with assurance the precise
                        course of Iran's economy over the next several years. A major uncertainty is
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s projection of oil revenues, which
                        depends on the outcome of discussions now under way with the Oil Consortium.
                        It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> projection of a
                        17% average annual increase is too high, but that there would nevertheless
                        be an appreciable rise in Iran's oil revenue, perhaps at a 12% annual rate.
                        Doubts were also expressed as to whether <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499"
                            facs="0527"/>Iran's non-petroleum exports will rise as fast as projected
                        by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, and whether the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could hold down its defense expenditures as
                        planned. The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> member expressed particular
                        concern that a shortfall of oil revenue could force a cutback in proposed
                        development expenditure by Iran's Plan Organization; such a cutback could
                        have internal political repercussions as well as economic implications,
                        since it could reduce government investment for the next few years below the
                        rate estimated for 1966 and 1967.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic">agreed</hi> that, although there was cause for optimism as
                        a result of Iran's past record and that, although there was no cause for
                        concern as to the $100 million military sales program proposed for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>68, it is most important that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> arms program not interfere unnecessarily
                        with Iran's economic development and progress. The actual course of Iran's
                        economic expansion will have to be kept under careful review, particularly
                        regarding Iran's ability to finance an arms buildup such as it proposes. The
                        balance between economic progress and defense outlay will continue to be a
                        prime factor in our consideration of Iran's specific request for arms each
                        year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Congressional Factors</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_IRG1"
                            >IRG</gloss> noted recent Congressional concern over arms races and over
                        possible excessive expenditure on defense by foreign countries with which we
                        have an aid or supply relationship. It also took note of the fact that our
                        ability to supply arms on credit to a country such as Iran after the end of
                        this fiscal year will depend upon passage of new military sales legislation
                        now before the Congress, and also on the availability of appropriated funds
                        to support annual credit sales programs. It was agreed that these factors
                        tended to militate against our seeking to enter into any more or less firm
                        “commitment,” however hedged, involving precise credit sales levels for
                        several years beyond the current fiscal year. The Chairman noted that any
                        type of multi-year proposal would probably have to be discussed with
                        Congressional leaders.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> member raised a question as to the
                        need for a Presidential determination in the event of an increase in the
                        military credit sales program for Iran in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1968, above the illustrative $50 million presented to the Congress last
                        year, under the final proviso in the military assistance item of the Foreign
                        Assistance and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1968. There is a
                        difference of view among legal experts in State, Defense, and <gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> on this question. It was agreed that this
                        issue should be clarified, but that it was not substantively critical to the
                        larger question before the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> inasmuch as
                        any recommendation on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 credit
                        sales tranche would require Presidential approval.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Annual Review</hi>. The members attached crucial
                        importance to the annual review of political, military, and economic factors
                        to be considered prior to a decision on each annual tranche of military
                        sales to Iran. It will be necessary, for example, to have in mind the
                        development of relations <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0528"/>between
                        Iran and Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf entities; the development
                        of the threat from the radical Arab states; the economic situation in Iran,
                        and particularly the effect of defense outlay on Iran's economic development
                        program; and our own military requirements, financial situation and credit
                        availabilities. The Chairman emphasized that the annual review will be a key
                        part of any multi-year arrangement with Iran. The precise level and
                        composition of each annual sales program would be decided upon the basis of
                        the annual review.</p>
                    <p>Conclusions and Recommendation. The <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>
                        considered a proposal for a six-year (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1968–<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973), $600 million military
                        credit sales proposal for Iran, as well as various alternatives, in the
                        light of the above factors. It was agreed that we have an overriding
                        political interest in offering to the Shah an arms supply proposal that
                        would be adequate to bolster the Shah's confidence in our desire to retain
                        our intimate military relationship with Iran; to keep him from feeling that
                        he had no choice but to turn to the Soviets for sophisticated arms; and to
                        support continuance of our present close and constructive overall ties with
                        Iran. It was agreed that some form of multi-year understanding is essential
                        for this purpose. It was also agreed that it would be desirable, if
                        possible, to conclude such an arrangement with Iran before the Shah's
                        expected visit to Washington on June 12, 1968.</p>

                        Summary: Prompted by his concerns re Persian Gulf security in future,
                        Washington delays, and his profound shock at President's decision not to
                        seek re-election, the Shah is anxious for a yes or no from <gloss

                            needs in next five-year period. Shah reiterated he wished to retain US
                            orientation as far as Iranian military is concerned. He is buying arms,
                            not seeking grant assistance. He has committed himself not to acquire
                            sophisticated weapons elsewhere, but he must know whether he can rely on

                            re-election. He considers President true personal friend in whom he has
                            utmost confidence. He cannot envision any successor so well disposed to
                            maintenance of Iranian-US relations, including in field of military
                            cooperation. On contrary, he despairs that successor President may
                            curtail arms cooperation which is core of current US-Iranian
                            relationship.</item>

                        <item>It is because of this uncertainty, coupled with fact that Shah has
                            already been waiting for some six months for answer to his question,
                            that Shah will insist on reasonably clear statement of US intentions
                            over next five year period. Without it, he is fully capable of taking
                            undesirable steps. It was my hope (Tehran 3869) that we could convince
                            our <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> colleagues of importance of
                            favorable decision, at same time assuring them that no one knows better
                            than Shah that we have adequate loop-holes to curtail our military
                            cooperation any time Shah misbehaves or we run into Congressional

                    <p>The United States Executive Branch declares its intention each year to seek
                        Congressional authority and appropriations for such credit sales as both
                        governments would agree were indicated to move toward accomplishment of the
                        program mentioned above. On the part of the United States the amount of
                        authority and funds sought, and the amount of sales made for cash, would be
                        subject to the results of a yearly review, with the Government of Iran,
                        including reviews of Iran's economic development and military programs, as
                        well as an assessment of the effect of military purchases on the Iranian
                        balance of payments and budgetary situation. The actual amount of credit
                        made available to Iran in each year will of course depend on the amount of
                        credit authorization and appropriations approved by the Congress and on
                        other U.S. requirements worldwide. If the amount of credit authorization and
                        appropriations approved by the Congress proves in future years to be
                        insufficient for the mutually agreed needs of Iran, the Executive Branch
                        declares its intention to do what it can to help Iran obtain credits from
                        non-Governmental banking sources.</p>

                    <p>Since last summer, the Shah has been pressing us for a new commitment on
                        credit sales in the 1970's. The comprehensive program he has developed in
                        conjunction with his U.S. advisers is a logical follow-on to our grant aid
                        program, and we believe it essential, in order to protect our important
                        interests in Iran and to assist the maintenance of stability in the Middle
                        East, that we be forthcoming in response to his requests for military
                        credits to support it. Our arms supply relationship is of decisive
                        importance to our overall ties with Iran. These ties bring us important
                        benefits, including collaboration on military and intelligence operations,
                        and the intangibles of friendly cooperation with an ally on the
                        international scene. Moreover, the importance of our ties with Iran has
                        increased as a result of the announced British withdrawal from the Persian
                        Gulf, the growing Soviet threat in the Middle East, the continuing
                        instability of the Arab world, and real doubts about long term continuance
                        of U.S. facilities at Peshawar.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, I cannot recommend that the United States undertake at this
                        time a firm commitment for the full $500 million additional credit program
                            (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969–73). Uncertainties about
                        Congressional authorization of future arms credits and the level of
                        appropriations, about the effect of future defense spending on the Iranian
                        economy and about the development of Iranian-Arab relations make it prudent
                        to base the program after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 on the
                        outcome of thorough annual political, military and economic reviews.</p>
                    <p>Some form of multi-year understanding for future years is, however, essential
                        to meet our objectives in Iran, and we believe that recommendation 2 (above)
                        should achieve this purpose while at the same time maintaining a requisite
                        degree of flexibility. We are fully aware that, by <pb n="507"
                            xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>adopting this cautious policy, we run the
                        very real risk that the Shah may consider the proposed arrangement too
                        indefinite and therefore insufficient. This could trigger another round of
                        bargaining or, alternatively, might cause him to turn to other arms sources,
                        including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern European
                        countries. Should the Shah react in this manner, we believe your June 12
                        luncheon with him could be critical, and we would, if it proves necessary,
                        propose additional course of action for your consideration prior to that
                        date.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing recommendation has been submitted by the Interdepartmental
                        Regional Group for the Near East and South Asian Affairs under Assistant

                            memorandum from Rostow to the President that reads: “You should know

                            Iranian arms package. There was considerable delay in the bureaucracy in
                            developing an agreed position. Meanwhile, the Shah is becoming restless,
                            having had reason to expect a response earlier. You will recall that he
                            mentioned the matter to <persName>John McCloy</persName>, underlining
                            that he was, after all, willing to pay for these arms and that our

                    </list>
                    <p>Shortly after his visit last August, the Shah wrote you<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d281fn2">
                            <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> that he intended to
                        embark on a new five-year $800 million program for further <pb n="508"
                            xml:id="pg_508" facs="0536"/>modernizing his armed forces. He is now
                        down to $600 million for six years, and this will be uppermost in his mind
                        when he sees you June 12.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that the Shah will go ahead with some such program. The
                        issues are how to keep it from slowing his economic development and how to
                        keep him from turning to other suppliers.</p>
                    <p>No one has serious reservations about going ahead with the proposed $75–100
                        million program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68. <persName>Nick
                            Katzenbach</persName> recommends you approve this subject to
                        satisfactory Congressional consultations. He would start at $75 million and
                        hold the additional $25 million for you to throw in when the Shah comes.</p>
                    <p>The real issue is how we assure the Shah that we will participate in this
                        program without actually committing ourselves. He says he has to know what
                        he can count on. We can't say for sure, and we have good reason for not
                        wanting to jump in all at once even if we could: <list>
                            <item>—We don't know what military sales authority Congress will approve
                                or how much it will appropriate. We don't want to tie up funds until
                                we see how much we have to divide worldwide.</item>
                            <item>—We're wary about Iran's committing so much to military
                                expenditures so far ahead. We'd like to go year by year.</item>
                            <item>—When the British withdraw from the Persian Gulf, Iran and Saudi
                                Arabia face a number of difficult issues there. We want to be
                                careful about how we build up a new sub-regional super-power.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Offsetting these reservations is our need to maintain a close relationship.
                        Now that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has phased out, our military
                        program is the major concrete manifestation of that relationship. We look to
                        the Shah to maintain a pro-western Iran and depend on him for even expanding
                        our sensitive intelligence collection activities.</p>
                    <p>The Shah believes he must be strong enough militarily to deter any
                        attack—overt or subversive—by the Arab radicals. He is worried, as he told
                            <persName>John McCloy</persName>, about Soviet gains in the area. He
                        knows the British are pulling out. He fears even more that our policy since
                        last June indicates diminished US interest in the Mid-East. Therefore, he
                        wants to modernize his forces but, perhaps even more important, he wants
                        some reassurance of our continuing concrete interest in his security. It's
                        quite possible that we may not be able to satisfy him.</p>
                    <p>To tread the narrow line between general assurance and specific commitment
                        for the next five years, State and Defense have devised the finely worded
                        paragraph under recommendation #2 in <persName>Nick Katzenbach</persName>'s
                        attached memo.<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">Reference is to <ref
                                target="#d280">Document 280</ref>.</note> Essentially, it says we'll
                        do what we can to help with his five-year program but we just can't commit
                        ourselves that far ahead. We'd declare Executive Branch intention to push
                        ahead year-by-<pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>year toward
                        accomplishment of the Shah's program. You will want to read the fine
                        print.</p>
                    <p>The real problem is not the approval of this well-hedged formula. The problem
                        will be whether you feel you can make this stick with the Shah when you see
                        him on June 12. You will have the tough job of trying to persuade him of the
                        continuity of the US-Iranian relationship without knowing either what the
                        Congress will do or who your successor will be. Your line will have to be
                        that (a) anyone who sits in your seat will be impressed with the necessity
                        of a strong continuing US-Iran relationship and (b) we hope he will bear
                        with us through this transitional period.</p>
                    <p>In the face of this difficulty, I recommend you approve this approach as a
                        start. Regrettably, there seems little chance of devising a more flexible
                        position for you, at least until Congress acts.</p>

                                        years and that we engage to cooperate with him in his

                                    <p>The United States Executive Branch declares its intention
                                        each year to seek Congressional authority and appropriations
                                        for such credit sales as both governments would agree were
                                        indicated to move toward accomplishment of the program
                                        mentioned above. On the part of the United States the amount
                                        of authority and funds sought, and the amount of sales made
                                        for cash, would be subject to the results of a yearly
                                        review, with the Government of Iran, including reviews of
                                        Iran's economic development and military programs, as well
                                        as an assessment of the effect of military purchases on the
                                        Iranian balance of payments and budgetary situation. The
                                        actual amount and terms of credit made available to Iran in
                                        each year will of course depend on the amount of credit
                                        authorization and appropriations approved by the Congress,
                                        on prevailing credit market factors, and on other U.S.
                                        requirements world-wide. If the amount of credit
                                        authorization and appropriations approved by the Congress
                                        proves in future years to be insufficient for the mutually
                                        agreed needs of Iran, the Executive Branch declares its
                                        intention to do what it can to help Iran obtain credits from
                                        non-Governmental banking sources.</p>

                            stability in the area. We further hope that with this arrangement made,
                            Iran can devote the fullest possible resources to economic development
                            and social reform.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>You should tell the Shah that as in former years we have carefully
                            reviewed the economic data provided by the Central Bank and congratulate
                            Iran on its continuing economic progress. Although we have concluded
                            that Iran's economy is making good progress and warrants a large credit
                            increment this year, there are a few points of concern. For example, we
                            note that security expenditures have grown very rapidly over the last
                            few years and we hope it will be possible for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to keep the increase closer to the
                            growth in the economy and, in any event, no higher than that projected
                            in the Central Bank figures (11.6 percent increase per year) in future
                            years. We are also concerned that increasing payments for arms purchases
                            may reduce total public investment and thus reduce the rate of economic
                            growth. We believe economic improvement and social betterment are best

                    </list>
                    <p>One problem you might like to begin thinking about again as we prepare for
                        the Shah's visit (June 12) is the situation in the Persian Gulf. It's bound
                        to come up.</p>
                    <p>As you know, both the Shah and <persName>Faisal</persName> understand that
                        they must cooperate to prevent outside interference in the Persian—or
                        “Arab”—Gulf. The two rulers have much in common—especially a dislike for
                        Nasser—and, aside from dividing valuable underwater oil concessions which
                        could be worked out, no specific bilateral problems in the Gulf.</p>
                    <p>There is a basic conflict, however, between the Iranian assumption that Iran
                        has the mission of controlling the Gulf, and the Saudi assumption that Saudi
                        Arabia is responsible for everything on the Arabian peninsula. This has led
                        to Saudi support for the Arab sheikhdoms on the Gulf and the sheikhs do have
                        conflicting claims with Iran.</p>
                    <p>The nine British protectorates in the Gulf recently formed a Federation of
                        Arab Amirates. So far the organization has not found workable machinery, but
                        the nine rulers keep holding meetings in an effort to create a viable
                        confederation. Apparently they are going to get King
                            <persName>Faisal</persName>'s blessing. The trouble is that the Shah
                        claims part of their territory.</p>
                    <p>Iran has a longstanding claim to Bahrain, one of the nine Amirates. The
                        Saudis have tried to play down Bahraini participation, and the Shah says he
                        won't push his claim if he isn't challenged directly on it. But as the amirs
                        organize, the challenge becomes clearer. The news of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>'s latest meetings has led the Shah to
                        consider the cancellation of a proposed November visit to Saudi Arabia. (You
                        will remember that the Shah “postponed” his visit last January after a
                        Saudi-Bahraini communique spoke of the “Arab character” of the Gulf.)</p>
                    <p>The other territorial disagreement hasn't yet become a major problem, but
                        could be as serious. Iran claims some islands in Hormuz Strait (the Tunbs
                        and Abu Musa) which leads from the Gulf to the Arabian Sea. As long as the
                        British held the Islands, the Shah was content to let the claim lie dormant.
                        He is now afraid that if the Arabs get the islands, it will only be a matter
                        of time before Nasser establishes a naval base there <pb n="514"
                            xml:id="pg_514" facs="0542"/>and blockades Iran. His fears may be
                        groundless, but for him this is a real danger.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully, the Shah and <persName>Faisal</persName> will let their common
                        interest overcome minor territorial disputes, but it won't be easy. Our
                        policy is to stay out of the middle but to keep reminding both of them that
                        the best way to keep Nasser and the Russians out is to work together. State
                        has been back and forth over this problem and decided that our main effort
                        should be gradually to expand our representation in the Gulf to make our
                        views heard but generally not to think in terms of major US programs.</p>

                        <item>Dinner for the Shah</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You asked whether we could have a big dinner for the Shah to which he might
                        bring his wife, instead of the small working luncheon we had planned for him
                        on June 12.</p>
                    <p>Both your schedule and the Shah's would permit our having a large dinner on
                        June 11. Everyone here and at State feels that, from the foreign policy
                        viewpoint, this would be a good thing to do. The only reason we had not
                        suggested it before was that the Shah had been here on an official visit
                        just last August and, since he is coming this time on a private visit to
                        receive an honorary degree, we did not want to impose on you for another
                        dinner. However, if you would like to have him, we would all be
                        delighted.</p>
                    <p>We cannot be sure that his wife could come. She has decided not to accompany
                        him on this trip. However, she will just have been to Ethiopia with him,
                        will come as far as Europe with him and then will go on to Morocco with him
                        after his visit here. The Shah has never told us exactly <pb n="515"
                            xml:id="pg_515" facs="0543"/>why she did not wish to come here, but we
                        believe that her unpleasant experiences with demonstrating students in
                        Berlin on a previous trip may have made her wary of coming here, where
                        Iranian students usually demonstrate against the Shah when he comes. She
                        might reconsider and come just for the White House part of the trip, but we
                        cannot guarantee this.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to invite the Shah to dinner on June 11 in hopes that the
                        Empress can come too, we would propose the attached message<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d286fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> from you suggesting
                        this change in plans and making a special point of your wish to entertain
                        the Empress before you leave the White House.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to wrap this all up in one day, we could reschedule the office
                        visit to 5:30 P.M. on June 11. If not, we would leave it scheduled for 12:30
                        P.M. on June 12.</p>
                    <p>Once we have your preference and the Shah's acceptance, we will work out the
                        announcement with George Christian.</p>

                        subject of our installations at Peshawar and the Pakistani request that we
                        leave there by July 1969. Implied in any such question will be whether we
                        are thinking of increasing our facilities in Iran as a result of the loss of
                        Peshawar.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with a decision you made in the spring of 1966, we have been
                        taking steps, on a contingency basis, to make possible the transfer of some
                        of the Peshawar operations to Iran. We have not yet decided, however, when
                        any such transfers should be made or the extent to which it would be
                        politically feasible to make such transfers, in the light of our relations
                        with Iran and our desire to retain our existing facilities in Iran.</p>

                    <p>You might tell the Shah, if he raises the matter, that we are still studying
                        the situation caused by Pakistan's request that we leave Peshawar and have
                        not yet reached any firm conclusion. You might assure him that if it turns
                        out that we would desire to increase our operations in Iran, we would of
                        course discuss the matter with him beforehand, any such increases <pb

                                million sale in a $600 million six-year program. We stated our
                                intention to go ahead year by year, but we had to say we can't
                                commit ourselves ahead until Congress gives us new authority. The
                                one thing you can do is to start off the conversation by telling him
                                that we can go all the way to 100 million this year. (We had told
                                him “$75–100 million” pending final review of funding
                                possibilities.)</item>

                                British pull-out by 1971 leaves Iran, Saudi Arabia and the little
                                Arab principalities face-to-face with a series of conflicting claims
                                over territory and oil rights. We want the leaders on the ground to
                                get together rather than looking to us to arrange a settlement. The
                                Shah understands our position, but knowing you are watching will
                                underline it. He apparently had a good airport talk with
                                    <persName>Faisal</persName> on his way here, and we hope he'll

                        that he plans to raise two military supply topics at their 1230 meeting
                        today: (1) additional U.S. advisors/maintenance personnel to help Iran's
                        armed forces assimilate advanced equipment being purchased from the U.S. and
                        (2) the Peace Ruby air control and warning system which is to be constructed
                        along the Persian Gulf. The Shah may also discuss his desire to buy fast <pb

                                <hi rend="italic">U.S. Advisors</hi>. The Shah wants to take
                                delivery on two more squadrons of F–4 interceptors as quickly as
                                possible. ARMISH/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has developed
                                a training plan which should permit the Iranian Air Force to operate
                                and maintain these aircraft by 1971. The Shah wants these aircraft
                                earlier, has investigated contract maintenance (by
                                    <persName>McDonnell</persName>) but finds it extremely expensive
                                ($10–12 million per year).</p>
                            <p>The Shah therefore concludes that we could save him this $10–12
                                million per year by adding about 200 U.S. airmen to our advisory
                                mission to maintain the new aircraft. We are seeking to discourage
                                this corruption of the role of the advisory mission (and the
                                concomitant acceleration of Iran's procurement program), citing
                                Vietnam requirements and our general cutbacks in U.S. personnel
                                overseas. This point is adequately covered in the President's
                                talking paper.</p>

                                limited air control and warning system, built by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US, was purchased by Iran in
                                1966 to extend radar coverage and communication along Iran's Persian
                                Gulf coast. Since that time, the delivery schedule has slipped
                                nearly two years (1970 to 1972) owing to unforeseen path testing
                                difficulties and unrealistic production leadtime estimates, and
                                costs have increased sharply ($21.3 to $37.8 million) as a result of
                                faulty initial estimates, system changes and equipment price
                                increases.</p>
                            <p>Iran has indicated that it plans to shift the program from a
                                government-to-government arrangement to a direct contact with a US
                                manufacturer. This would eliminate the time required for competitive
                                bidding and restore the original schedule, but it would cost Iran a
                                bit more than the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> contract. We
                                have no objection to this shift and have made certain changes in our
                                joint credit arrangements to permit Iran to go this route if it
                                desires.</p>

                            to the PG–84 by the US Navy, that the West German Tartar program is
                            still in the development stage, and that we are not yet convinced that
                            missile boats represent Iran's best defense against the Iraqi
                                <persName>Komar</persName> threat (aircraft may well prove the most

                    </list>
                    <p>The Shah said that it is necessary for Iran's defense forces in the Persian
                        Gulf area to be ready by the time the British leave the Gulf. He expressed
                        particular concern about Iran's having the capacity to deal with the missile
                        boats that Iraq is receiving and to be able to counter the psychological
                        boost given the Soviet Union through their fleet visits. He could not
                        foresee Iran's having in the near future sufficient naval forces to cope
                        with these problems because Iran has insufficient trained manpower. He
                        looked instead to a combination of naval craft, aircraft and land-based
                        missiles to take care of his country's needs in the Gulf.</p>
                    <p>The Shah referred specifically to his need to obtain technicians from the US
                        to assist Iran in maintaining the F–4's which will soon be received from the
                        United States. He also referred to the need to carry through with the
                        aircraft control and warning project in south Iran and also the national
                        communications project.</p>
                    <p>The Shah stressed that he must be able to plan militarily several years in
                        advance and therefore needs assurance from us that we will be able to meet
                        his needs over such a period. Responding to the Secretary's comment that we
                        are now in our annual hassle with the Congress on our military assistance
                        and sales programs, the Shah said that he had two suggestions. One is for
                        the Defense Department to include Iran's requirements in its orders of
                        equipment for American forces. This would tend to keep the prices for Iran
                        down. Alternatively, the Defense Department might be able to persuade
                        American arms manufacturers to give Iran special favorable prices. In either
                        case, favorable prices would serve to offset the cost to Iran of financing
                        it might have to obtain from commercial banks.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary indicated that after our nominating conventions, it might be
                        useful for the Executive Branch to discuss this subject with the candidates
                        of both parties. He said that he believed the present leading candidates
                        favor our program of military cooperation with Iran, and the Shah said that
                        he also believes this to be the case.</p>

                            useful in terms drawing attention to Iran's burgeoning economy and
                            investment opportunities, although Shah made special point that foreign
                            firms investing in Iran can have no better than 50–50
                            arrangement.</item>

                            remarks at dinner and private discussions reflected warm and close
                            friendship of the two men and their countries. Shah also met with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and with
                                <persName>Dillon Ripley</persName> of Smithsonian Institution in

                        <item>Principal substantive subjects on Shah's mind in Washington talks were
                            (a) need to bolster Iran's defense capabilities in light forthcoming
                            British departure from Persian Gulf and (b) desire of Iran to sell
                            additional oil to US on barter basis. Talks also reviewed general world
                            situation including Soviet policies in Eastern Europe, Korea and
                            Vietnam, and current situation in Near East. As in previous visits of
                            Shah to Washington, exchanges on world affairs were full and frank, with
                            basic similarity of views on both sides.</item>

                        <item>In light private nature of visit, press coverage has not been as great
                            as during last August's official visit. Press has speculated primarily
                            on military discussions.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> came in just to wind up a
                        general discussion of economic development in Iran which he and Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> had begun at the dinner for the Shah.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> began by placing Iran at that point on the
                        development ladder where the “take off” is just about finished and the
                        nation is beginning to diffuse its resources and technology into a broad
                        range of new industries. He likened Iran somewhat to Mexico, noting that
                        Iran was still just a little bit behind. Looking to the future, he felt that
                        Iran's greatest increase in revenue would come not from pressing for
                        marginal increases in oil earnings, but would come from the widespread
                        expansion of processing industries. The important principle will be for Iran
                        to reap the profits of value added to its raw materials rather than to let
                        these profits go to processors outside Iran.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> asked what he thought Iran
                        should do in mining its metal ores. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said he
                        could not be sure without studying the resources and markets in detail, but
                        in general he felt that Iran might look at the example of Sweden. He felt it
                        would make sense for Iran to move gradually from selling raw ore into
                        various stages of processing. He urged that Iran, in developing new
                        processing industries in all fields, not be afraid of foreign capital to
                        start with but to be sure in its initial agreements with foreign investors
                        to provide for the gradual transfer of management and control to Iranian
                        hands. He felt this would undercut much domestic opposition to the suspected
                        “new-imperialism” of foreign capital and would avoid embarrassing political
                        problems for both sides later.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>, as he had promised Tuesday night, gave Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> a collection of memoranda
                        and articles on the need for high protein additives to improve nutritional
                        levels (copies provided to <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>). Entirely
                        apart from the human obligation to do our best by each child that is born,
                        he said it makes sense purely from the hard-headed planner's point of view
                        to insure that a developing country will have the best minds it can develop,
                        and we have now learned that adequate diet is an essential part <pb n="531"
                            xml:id="pg_531" facs="0559"/>of producing those minds. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> expressed his gratitude and asked
                        whether we would be able to send someone out to help develop a project in
                        this field, once his government had decided what it needed. Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> would certainly be prepared to
                        discuss this when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> was
                        ready.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> also stressed the possible importance of
                        educational television. He said that a country like Iran must learn to
                        develop talent within the country and not to rely entirely on education
                        abroad. Where there is a shortage of teachers, educational television can
                        bring the best teachers to even the remotest areas. He recommended that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> talk with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> or <persName

                        <item>(S) During the recent talks with the President, the Shah of Iran
                            raised the question of the best military way of dominating the entrance
                            to the Persian Gulf. The Shah also expressed his concern about the
                            Russian Fleet and the Persian Gulf and asked whether the United States
                            could fix missiles owned and controlled by Iran on the islands in the
                            Strait of Hormuz to dominate it.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>(S) By his concern, the Shah identified the major threat to the
                            Persian Gulf as the Soviet Navy. However, this threat is not considered
                            immediate and therefore all elements of the problem should be thoroughly
                            examined before changing the proposed sales program, which was recently
                            developed in response to previous requests by the Shah.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>(S) Considering the range, nature of the target, usual temperature and
                            environmental factors, it would seem that the <persName>Nike
                                Hercules</persName> is the only missile in the United States
                            inventory that would approach the Shah's requirements. One or two
                            batteries (nine launchers each) located on the mainland or on Larak or
                            Qeshm Islands, could deliver 500 pounds of high explosive to any point
                            in the strait with an estimated 200 yard circular error probable (<gloss
                                target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>). A guided missile system would have
                            the advantage that such a system could probably be established without
                            the undue irritation that would be caused by measures such as mining.
                            Disadvantages of the system would be the high cost (probably at least $4
                            million per battery), the need for another variety of specialized
                            personnel, and the susceptibility to enemy destruction. Production lines
                            of this missile are presently shut down. In addition, experience in use
                            of the <persName>Nike Hercules</persName> in the surface-to-surface role
                            is considered inadequate to justify expenditure of funds to employ this

                            These are also considered more practical, when available, than an island

                            recommended that an attempt be made to dissuade the Shah from procuring

                    <p>Your Imperial Majesty:</p>
                    <p>Since your departure from Washington, my staff has looked carefully into the
                        pricing of F–4 aircraft.<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2">A June 20 memorandum

                            about aircraft prices paid by the U.S. Air Force versus those paid by

                                >Warnke</persName> wrote that Iran had paid no more, and in one case
                            paid less, than the costs that the U.S. armed services would have
                            incurred in purchasing the same number of aircraft of the same
                            configuration at the same time. (Ibid.)</note> As a result, I can assure
                        you that Iran has paid no more than the costs our armed services would incur
                        in purchasing the same number of aircraft at the same time. I do not expect
                        this situation to change in the future.</p>
                    <p>I have asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHJ1">Henry Kuss</persName> of my
                        staff to discuss this matter in some detail with Governor <persName

                        which he may have on either past or future procurement.</p>
                    <p>It was indeed a pleasure to see you again. The occasion gave me an
                        opportunity to re-acquaint myself with the great advances Iran has made in
                        recent years under your wise leadership.</p>

                                make clear what he still needs to decide. Once there is a definite
                                plan, we will see how we can help, but the issue is just not

                        if student problems did not exist. However, for the moment at least,
                        potential student demagogy is having trouble tilting against Iran's economic
                        boom and Shah's “independent nationalism” policies. So student problems will
                        probably remain low key, although in long run student unrest could erupt,
                        particularly if Shah's present highly successful policies should begin to
                        falter.</p>

                        <item>In Iran, student unrest is largely function of political status quo.
                            Politically, Shah and his regime have never been more firmly in saddle.
                            As result of “white revolution” and “independent nationalism” policies,
                            wind has been taken out of sails of opposition, i.e., remnants of Tudeh
                            and National Front parties can no longer effectively accuse regime of
                            being feudalist or U.S. puppet, meanwhile, economic boom, premised on
                            $800 million oil revenues, leaves oppositionists, past or potential,
                            with few flags to wave.</item>

                        <item>This is not to say that younger generation in Iran is less restive
                            than youth elsewhere. Rebellious adolescent instincts exist. They are
                            encouraged by epidemic of student unrest elsewhere in world, including
                            even in Communist Bloc. They should never be judged as less than
                            incipient. It must be remembered that massive student uprisings against
                            Shah's regime did occur here in early 1950's, cleverly manipulated by
                            demagogic leader, Mosadeq. As recently as 1963, major uprising occurred
                            at Tehran University, which was quelled by rather ruthless police
                            action.</item>

                        <item>Present day Iran affords some special opportunities for student
                            unhappiness. Despite economic boom, there is almost legendary lack of
                                <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0566"/>identification. Decisions
                            are made by Shah or not much lower than cabinet-technocrat level. There
                            is thus little feeling of participation in decision-making, least of all
                            among student groups. This frustration is, however, for the moment
                            considerably offset by prospects of personal economic gain and by vague
                            awareness (and pride) that compared with other countries in Mideast Iran
                            is somewhat a model of economic development and social progress.
                            Dissatisfaction which exists tends to be less focussed on Shah and has
                            become more of an amorphous discontent with political structure.
                            Specific issues for stirring up dissidence are, however, quite
                            unpromising. In short, instead of passionate student hostility there is
                            student apathy, which is less but still worrisome.</item>

                        <item>In Iran, Shah monarchy has 2500-year tradition. It may one day give
                            way to liberal democracy, but it is institution which still is
                            effective, particularly as so cagily manipulated by present Shah.
                            Mosadeq sought to tilt with this institution and Shah as its
                            personification with 20th century weapons, but, as so often happens in
                            emerging societies, Mosadeq employed totalitarian tools as much or more
                            than regime against which he tilting. Still today there is some
                            lingering pro-Mosadeq sentiment. For example, there seems to be goodly
                            number of secondary school teachers who mostly due to limited
                            qualifications have never risen to prominence and who still tend to
                            carry Mosadeq torch. Their teaching has some influence on university
                            enrollment (which knew not Mosadeq), with sort of greener pastures
                            overtones. But this sentiment, as all other oppositionism, bucks
                            national self-congratulation induced by Iran's present manifest
                            prosperity and progress.</item>

                        <item>Some controversy inevitably develops over manner in which <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> copes with student manifestations.
                            Thanks largely to university leadership, peaceful student marches have
                            been condoned, but any activism is quickly suppressed by police (and
                                <gloss target="#t_SAVAK1">SAVAK</gloss>) action. This, of course,
                            reaps student resentment. In case of Pahlavi University unrest several
                            students were locked up and accused under highly questionable pretexts
                            of being <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> agents. In future,
                            ruthless police methods could contribute to student explosion. However,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> leadership is convinced that
                            strong police action is in keeping with exercise of authority as
                            historically practiced in Iran. Its belief in efficacy such measures has
                            only been strengthened by dramatic reports of recent student riots in
                            US/other countries where in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> eyes
                            administration has been too lax.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Fact that Shah has always been good America friend, and in particular
                            prevailed over Mosadeq with American blessing, tends to associate Shah's
                            regime, despite its flirtations with Soviets, with US. Since he is
                            riding high, US is for present in relatively good position, although
                            among student groups there is inevitably unhappiness over Shah's
                            military expenditures, as well as U.S. role in Viet Nam. Nonetheless,
                            there have been no demonstrations in Iran re Viet Nam, even by students.
                                <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0567"/>Therefore, under present
                            circumstances chances of student revolt being centered on
                            anti-Americanism are not bright.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Student problem was reported in greater detail in A–576, along with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> activities connected therewith. Of course, student
                            situation could explode at moment's notice. However, our best guess is
                            that student troubles in Iran will at least for present remain at
                            relatively low key. Student grievances are apt for the present to center
                            on university policies. In long run, however, political frustrations
                            could mount up, particularly if Shah's dream of transforming Iran into
                            political entity with Western European standards of living does not
                            materialize.</item>

                        <item>Shah stressed vital importance of Persian Gulf to Iran. It simply not
                            possible to permit vacuum which will occur by British withdrawal to be
                            filled by irresponsible forces. To assure Iran's interest and,
                            therefore, Gulf security Iran must play role consonant with its size and
                            capability. Most effective means for doing so would be potential control
                            of Strait of Hormuz. Knowledge that Iran has such capability would in
                            Shah's view serve as most effective deterrent. We emphasized Iran must
                            be prepared by end of 1971, date of British withdrawal.</item>

                            peninsula). Shah discussed merits of land-based missiles at mouth of
                            Gulf. He felt they would have maximum optical impact of deterrent
                            nature. If land-based missiles (he has impression Tartar missiles have
                            40 mile radius) unfeasible, missile-carrying boats would be alternate.
                            He mentioned possibility of Bagrielle missiles and expressed belief
                            their Israeli origin could be successfully camouflaged by saying they

                            attention to fact that air force is potent weapon indeed in handling
                            threat from enemy navy. Nothing could give greater optical impact than
                            Phantoms screaming across horizon. Shah was concerned that air force
                            could not do job at night or during inclement weather. But readily
                            agreed that air force would be primary instrument inside Gulf.</item>

                                >USAF</gloss> technicians as soon as some could be spared from Viet

                        <item>Shah affirmed Iran must avoid duplications in country-wide
                            communications systems. He reiterated, however, that air defense
                            communications must be independent, mentioning again the ease with which
                            potential enemy can knock out microwave pylon. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHJ1">Kuss</persName> pointed out no nation has
                            completely separate military communications and noted that if pylon
                            knocked out alternative routings would be possible. Shah eventually
                            concurred that <gloss target="#t_PTT1">PTT</gloss> should be backbone of
                            basic military system and even that separate air defense communications
                            be installed in order of priority, utilizing at least temporarily such
                                <gloss target="#t_PTT1">PTT</gloss> links as are already available.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHJ1">Kuss</persName> stressed saving in money
                            is secondary to economic utilization of Iran's limited supply of
                            technicians. He also noted that TOPO communications centers just as
                            vulnerable as microwave centers. <persName>Re Peace Ruby</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHJ1">Kuss</persName> agreed <gloss

                            within three months. Shah at least tentatively decided to save time by
                            negotiating with sole source rather than resorting to competitive
                            bidding.</item>

                            for 75 slots provided as result his discussions with President year ago.
                            He expressed unhappiness with training of 25 pilots in Pakistan, on
                            grounds program is inferior, trainees being supplied with <gloss

                            asking Iran for training equipment and instructors. Shah stated he
                            prepared to postpone expensive present plans for developing pilot
                            training in Iran if there is assurance that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> will continue to train pilots to meet Iran's needs.

                            reasonable and would take up with Chief Air Force and other US

                        <item>After extensive discussion of tank situation, Shah tended to agree to
                            slippage, if necessary, of Sheridan tank procurement, provided few such
                            tanks could be made available for advance training. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHJ1">Kuss</persName> noted how
                                <persName>Shileleigh</persName> also would be drain on technician
                            supply. Shah stressed Sheridans needed for tank destroyer mission. He
                            agreed to Gen. <persName>Twitchell</persName> reviewing situation to
                            insure best equipment for this mission. Re M–47, he has decided
                            Swingfires too expensive ($140,000) and tends toward use of 105 mm gun
                            with perhaps some of M–47's retaining 90 mm gun. Re engines for
                            retrofit, Shah tends toward Continental because it is identical with
                            engine in M–60, but will await results of test runs made in Italy.

                    <p>When he visited with you on June 11 and 12, the Shah made six specific
                        requests for various types of American assistance, largely in the military
                        field (see Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s memorandum, enclosed).<note

                        and the suggested letter to the Shah incorporates the principal conclusions
                        of these reviews. As you further instructed, memoranda, one on each request,
                        have been prepared and are enclosed:<note n="5" xml:id="d305fn5">Attached

                        be at this time, will serve to convince the Shah of our desire to <pb

                    <p>Some of the questions raised by the Shah are complex and I also enclose, for

                        not been able to do everything the Shah has asked us to do. Therefore, the
                        letter is straightforward in saying what we can and cannot do. Following is
                        the reasoning behind each of our answers, arranged in the same order as they
                        are mentioned in your letter:</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">1. What assurance can we give the Shah so he can plan on
                            obtaining arms on good financial terms from the US for his five-year
                            program</hi>?</p>
                    <p>It is still not possible for us to give the Shah any categorical assurance
                        that he can depend on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> credit in the
                        future since we do not know what authority Congress will give us to sell
                        arms on credit. We believe the best offer to make right now is for you to
                        promise the Shah to speak to your successor about your relationship with him
                        and the importance of our continuing cooperation. We have already given him
                        a general assurance that the Executive Branch will urge Congress to fund a
                        continued program, but your personal offer to intervene with your successor
                        might be a sufficiently attractive new element to make him feel that we are
                        doing everything possible.</p>

                    <p>We are prepared to send fifty supervisory-level personnel for a one-year
                        period to begin with if the Iranian Government will pay for them. We had
                        already planned to send three <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> mobile
                        training teams for a shorter period to help Iran handle its first F–4's this
                        fall, but we could send a mission for longer. However, with limited military
                        aid funds and our balance of payments problem, it would be hard to justify
                        to Congress our paying for these extra people over a period longer than that
                        required for familiarization with the new equipment.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> does not like the Shah's proposal to
                        station land-based missiles at the entrance to the Gulf because they are too
                        expensive, too uncertain, and too vulnerable to attack. <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would rather see the Shah rely on a
                        combination of his Air Force and some good missile gun boats. We would give
                        the Shah this preliminary <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> reaction and
                        offer to study the question further with him if he wishes.</p>

                    <p>Both of these projects still require decisions by the Shah's Government. We
                        have already turned over several preliminary engineering studies. We do have
                        proposals for helping the Shah decide exactly what he wants and for speeding
                        completion. But your best response to his question, rather than get into
                        these details, is to offer full discussion of these alternatives by our
                        Ambassador and military chief in Iran.</p>

                    <p>We would keep the door open for Iran's possible participation in this plane's
                        development. But since it is still in the design stages and is <pb n="545"
                            xml:id="pg_545" facs="0573"/>not planned for production before 1975, we
                        would suggest that the Shah move cautiously before committing much
                        money.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">6. Can the U.S. buy more oil from Iran</hi>?</p>
                    <p>This is the toughest. The best we can tell the Shah is that the Defense
                        Department would buy more refined products at competitive prices if such
                        products are available. This would not amount to too much because we already
                        have a long-term contract with <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">ARAMCO</gloss> to
                        buy Saudi products through the refinery on Bahrain. What the Shah really
                        wants is for us to increase purchases of crude oil from the National Iranian
                        Oil Company. Theoretically, we could do this by giving Iran a special import
                        quota or by bartering Iranian oil for US exports. The main problem with both
                        methods is that we would have to change our whole import quota system and
                        would thereby open ourselves to requests for similar treatment from our
                        other oil-producing friends, upset Venezuela and stir up a domestic hornet's
                        nest. He will be disappointed, but we suspect he will be prepared for this
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>I believe the Agencies have given these questions a fair look. The answers
                        are not entirely what the Shah might hope for. But they are reasonably
                        responsive and he should recognize this. The attached letter is for your

                    <p>1. The President has approved and you are hereby instructed to transmit the
                        following message to the Shah:</p>
                    <p>“Your Imperial Majesty: I must say once again what a great pleasure it was to
                        see you in Washington last month and to have the opportunity to share
                        thoughts with you and to seek your counsel on matters of mutual concern. My
                        admiration for your country's progress under your leadership continues to
                        grow.”</p>
                    <p>“During our conversation, you mentioned a number of specific matters on which
                        you indicated a desire for further consultations. We have reviewed these
                        matters in detail, and I am now in a position to give you additional
                        thoughts on all of them. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName> will also be prepared to discuss them further with
                        you.”</p>
                    <p>“I fully understand your concern and need for long-term military procurement
                        plans. Although our past undertakings to cooperate with Iran in the military
                        field have, like our present one, been conditioned on Congressional action,
                        they have come to fruition. It is my desire that we continue this
                        cooperation in the future and my hope that the Executive Branch, in accord
                        with the Congress, will continue the agreed programs of military cooperation
                        with Iran. I will discuss this subject with my successor and inform him of
                        the importance I attach to continuing close cooperation with Iran in all
                        fields.”</p>
                    <p>“In connection with your request for additional technical advisers for Iran's
                        F–4 aircraft, I am pleased to inform you that we will be able to provide, on
                        a reimbursable basis and initially for a one-year period, up to 50
                        additional United States Air Force personnel if they can be of substantial
                        assistance to advise and assist in providing maintenance management for
                        these aircraft. I suggest that the details of this arrangement be worked out
                        between your military people and the Chief of our Military Assistance
                        Advisory Group in Iran.”</p>
                    <p>“You mentioned your concern about defense arrangements in the Persian Gulf.
                        Our military people have made a preliminary investigation which reveals a
                        number of problems and indicates that a land-based missile defense of the
                        Strait of Hormuz would probably not be feasible. If <pb n="547"
                            xml:id="pg_547" facs="0575"/>you desire I shall be pleased to direct
                        that a detailed study be prepared for you on this subject, including
                        possible alternatives which might assist your future planning.”</p>
                    <p>“Your concern to have the most efficient radar and communications system, at
                        the lowest cost, for your southern defense, is of course a matter on which
                        our military people have been working together for some months. I have asked
                        the Department of Defense to consider urgently how we can assist Iran's
                        needs in this connection. Our Ambassador and the Chief of our Military
                        Assistance Advisory Group in Iran will be prepared to pursue this matter
                        with your people, and we will be as helpful as we can to you in exploring
                        possible alternatives.”</p>
                    <p>“I am currently having an evaluation made of the plans for the new aircraft
                        being developed by the Northrop Corporation that you mentioned to me. I
                        understand that it is now planned that this aircraft will be ready after
                        1975. The work on it is still in an early stage, but if it develops that a
                        consortium is to be formed and the aircraft lives up to design
                        specifications, Iran might give further consideration to participation in
                        this project. At that time perhaps our military planners could consult with
                        you as to what alternatives would be available for the further modernization
                        of the Iranian Air Force.”</p>
                    <p>“We have also looked into the possibilities for expanding the purchase of
                        Iranian oil by American companies or the American government, possibly on a
                        barter basis. I regret that there seems to be very little that can be done
                        in this regard outside of normal, existing trade channels. To give special
                        quotas to Iran for the import of petroleum into the United States or to
                        enter into special arrangements for the exchange of Iranian oil for American
                        goods would raise grave problems for our worldwide oil policy. On the other
                        hand, the Department of Defense regularly purchases refined oil products for
                        our forces in East Asia on the basis of competitive bidding, from a number
                        of sources, and if Iranian companies can supply the required quantities at
                        competitive prices we would be pleased to purchase them.”</p>
                    <p>“Finally, I appreciate your willingness to consider shifting a portion of
                        Iran's dollar reserves into long-term United States assets which will assist
                        our balance of payments, and I look forward to hearing further from you
                        about this at your convenience.”</p>
                    <p>“I take deep satisfaction, Your Majesty, in the warm relations between our
                        countries and look forward to doing what I can to strengthen these relations
                        still further in the future. You and the people of Iran can continue to
                        depend on the sympathy and support of the people of the United States as you
                        strive to build the kind of prosperous and secure Iran that you want.”</p>

                                pleased to have more detailed study conducted if Shah desires one.
                                Such a study would consider not only question of land-based missiles
                                but also of cost and effectiveness of alternative air and naval

                                characteristics of land-based missiles for defense of Strait of

                                would not be a deterrent since they would be susceptible to enemy

                        <item>Shah pointed out how he had hoped to do $800 million worth business in
                            US over next five years, and he mentioned capital goods, arms, and
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> securities. In passing he
                            expressed amazement at <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy which
                            restricts cheap oil from Mideast while consuming US's precious and

                            exported. Without closing door to this possibility, I recalled recent

                            to learn that via consortium substantial quantities of Iran oil are

                                >USAF</gloss> technicians available, initially for one year. Noting
                            our Balpa difficulties, I pointed out technicians would be on fully
                            reimbursable basis to which he agreed. Also stressed they would be

                                >ARMISH/MAAG</gloss> framework. He thought this best utilization of
                            technicians. It was left that General <persName>Twitchell</persName>

                            proceed with full study of Hormuz defense weaponry and expressed hope
                            results would be available expeditiously. If land-based missiles are
                            out, he hinted he might purchase certain hardware from Israelis (with
                            whom, he disclosed, he recently signed secret general credit agreement).
                            When I referred to Gabrielle missiles, Shah merely noted that there is
                            some doubt as to their range.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>

                            morning to determine best integration of communications systems in Iran.
                            Shah said it already decided that Peace <persName>Ruby</persName> with
                            its communications would go to Philco as sole source. He also disclosed
                            he has decided (whether it is irrevocable, I do not know) to purchase
                            mobile TOPO units from Northrop for $8,000,000. He noted they are almost
                            immediately available and eventually when land-based stations are
                            completed mobile units would be valuable reserve. I urged we see what
                            emerges from current deliberations.</item>

                        <item>Northrop P–530. Shah had already heard that Europeans are banding
                            together to produce their own fighter for mid-seventies and this would
                            probably rule out P–530 project. He was interested that <gloss

                            to stay in touch re this subject in coming months. If P–530's
                            unavailable, Shah is considering possibility that rehabbed F–4–C's might
                            eventually replace current F–5 squadrons.</item>

                        <item>Long-term Commitment. Although obviously disappointed Shah did not
                            make issue of five-year commitment. If military credit is unavailable
                            via <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> sources in coming years, he
                            said, he would seek to purchase directly from American companies even
                            using cash if necessary. I explained <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            record vis-a-vis Iran in field of military collaboration is impressive.
                            Also emphasized that given Congressional and other problems in
                            Washington these days <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, with
                            concurrence of all Washington quarters, is again treating Iran very well
                            indeed. I added that this unique treatment reflects confidence which
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has in Shah's constructive,
                            non-demagogic, and peaceful policies.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>I thank you most sincerely for your detailed letter of 24th July,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d309fn2">See <ref target="#d307">Document 307</ref>.</note> in
                        which you have stated your opinions and enlarged upon various topics that I
                        had the pleasure of discussing with you during my recent visit to
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>Once again, I would like you to know how glad I was to have had the benefit
                        of a frank and valuable exchange of views with you on matters affecting the
                        interests of our two countries.</p>
                    <p>I too, am highly gratified to observe the amicable relations and the good
                        understanding that exist between Iran and the United States of America,
                        which I trust will continue to be further consolidated to our mutual
                        advantage in the years that lie ahead.</p>
                    <p>As you, Mr. President, are no doubt aware we have already drawn up our
                        military defense plans which, as you will agree, are absolutely vital and of
                        paramount importance to the maintenance and the safeguarding of the
                        interests of an independent sovereign state. You will also concur with me
                        that we cannot rely on one-year military programmes, but must envisage
                        effective long-range plans for our defence. It is my hope that your
                        Government will be able to continue to meet our requirements as before. I
                        look forward to receiving, as soon as is convenient, the results of the
                        detailed technical evaluation which your experts are carrying out on the
                        project for the defence of the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
                    <p>I had also hoped that by selling Iranian oil on the American market on a
                        barter basis, this would have facilitated our purchase of American <pb
                            n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0581"/>goods, while at the same time
                        enabling us to invest part of our capital in the United States. But, to my
                        regret, this does not, owing to certain difficulties that you have indicated
                        in your communication, seem feasible at the present time.</p>
                    <p>The matter concerning the shifting of a portion of my country's dollar
                        reserves into long-term United States assets is under careful study and
                        serious consideration at the moment, and I shall be pleased to apprise you
                        of the outcome in due course.</p>
                    <p>I wish to express my gratitude for your thoughtful offer of up to 50
                        additional United States Air Force personnel as advisors for Iran's F–4
                        aircraft on a reimbursable basis. This, I am convinced will be of great
                        assistance to us.</p>
                    <p>In conveying my deep appreciation of the kind and friendly sentiments that
                        you, Mr. President, have expressed on your personal behalf and on that of
                        the People of the United States of America in regard to my country and
                        myself, I send you my cordial and heartfelt good wishes for your continued
                        success in the great task that lies on your shoulders of leading your Nation
                        towards an ever brighter and more prosperous future.</p>

                        that it might be inadvisable in terms of our relations with the Shah and our

                        planned. The main issue to be resolved is the political advisability of
                        proceeding with the plan. In addition there are some questions about how
                        much intelligence effort in Iran is needed to substitute for Peshawar. Mr.

                        Shah himself is aware there may be some adverse public reaction in West to
                        his Moscow visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">On September 5 Ambassador

                        However, he believes visit ultimately will benefit Iran and free world

                        <item>Shah and I 17th discussed at length his forthcoming U.S.S.R. visit. He
                            said developments in Czechoslovakia had caused him to consider in depth
                            pros and cons of proceeding with trip as scheduled. He had concluded
                            life must go on. He noted <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> announced
                            continued support for <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and had
                            indicated contacts with Soviets would continue. It clear Soviet actions
                            in Czechoslovakia not going to be reversed by outside powers and
                            canceling his visit would certainly not do it. Meanwhile, he hoped his
                            speaking frankly to “those damned people” might do a little good.</item>

                        <item>Providing him with President's speeches re U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations and
                            following other suggestions from Dept, I urged Shah to convey to Soviets
                            his own views re detente and bridge-building, re Czech invasion, re Viet
                            Nam, re Arab-Israel situation, etc. He promised to report to us his
                            impressions re all these subjects, as well as re state of play inside
                            Kremlin leadership.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Re Arab-Israel situation, Shah said he had been encouraged by his
                            talks with King <persName>Hussein</persName> but this was offset by
                            report that Arab FornMins had decided on military rather than political
                            action. Nasser's speech had conciliatory note but current Arab arms and
                            propaganda build-up very disturbing. Shah reiterated his view that
                            Israeli demand for direct negotiations unwise. He also recalled
                                <persName>Kosygin</persName>'s telling him that Arab arms supplies
                            had been replenished after June disaster. Shah said he now questions
                            assumption that Soviets will or can control irrational Arab action, i.e.
                            early resumption of hostilities with Israel.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Shah said he also haunted by another remark by
                                <persName>Kosygin</persName> i.e., Western powers are organizing for
                            world war. Shah realizes this is nonsense but fears Soviets as is
                            typical may be projecting their own intentions. Shah noted reports that
                            Soviets have virtually closed ballistic <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556"
                                facs="0584"/>missile gap and that they may feel desperate in their
                            efforts to hold Commie Bloc together. If <persName>Kosygin</persName>
                            reiterates suggestion that West, particularly Germans, are bent on war,
                            Shah said only response he can think of is that there is no imaginable
                            reason why West should invite mass destruction. I ventured suggestion
                            that when <persName>Kosygin</persName> made that remark he undoubtedly
                            preoccupied how Kremlin was going to bring Czechs in line and might have
                            been concerned that military move by Soviets would precipitate world
                            conflict; thus accusing West was smokescreen. Shah agreed this might be
                            explanation.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Noting how Sovs will seek maximum exploitation his visit to restore
                            their image, I urged Shah to avoid Commie lingo which characterized
                                <persName>Kosygin</persName> visit communiqué, e.g., “atmosphere of
                            friendship,” “together with other peace-loving countries,” similarity of
                            views re European security, belief of signatories in “non-interference,”
                            etc. Shah showed clear desire to avoid playing this Soviet game to
                            extent possible. Re European security, he did, however, reiterate his
                            belief in nuclear-free zones, e.g., Central Europe (he believes we also
                            do not wish Germans to have nuclear weapons), as well as for Mideast
                            countries (“those crazy Arabs”).</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In discussing value of neighborly relations (within limits) with
                            Soviets, Shah noted such relations forestall Soviet clamor against
                            Iran's building up military strength in interest of Persian Gulf
                            security. This opened opportunity to suggest that it is not necessary to
                            punch US in nose when target is <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            e.g. Hoveyda's statements and DPA quotations of Shah that Americans will
                            not be permitted to replace British colonialism in Iran and in Gulf
                            area. Shah agreed it preferable to refer to other powers in
                            general.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Opportunity was also afforded to point out that real Soviet aim, as is
                            so clear from Soviet broadcasts, is ouster of U.S. presence and driving
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> back into isolationism. Shah
                            agreed, saying Soviets would then have free hand. He added that his own
                            regime is equally target of clandestine broadcasts but agreed with my
                            view that Soviets are “cultivating the land” for day when Shah's firm
                            hand is no longer at tiller.</item>

                        <item>In course of two-hour discussion 18th, Shah made clear that just as
                            Iran is launching $10 billion fourth five-year plan in economic field
                            Iran is also projecting five-year military program at only fraction
                            economic plan's cost. Naturally, he said, he wishes to maintain American
                            orientation of his military establishment but if present Congressional
                            discussions restrict credit sales to Iran he intends to purchase
                            elsewhere. He hopes at least, he said, to keep Iran Air Force
                            American-oriented.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Without any taint of blackmail, Shah reported Soviets are almost daily
                            manifesting eagerness to expand arms sales program begun year ago, with
                            repayment in natural gas. Shah frankly acknowledged Soviet purpose is to
                            wean Iran away from Americans. My impression is that Shah is well aware
                            not only of Soviet purposes but of inferiority of Soviet
                            equipment.</item>

                        <item>Shah noted French also are eagerly making sales pitches. Their
                            aircraft are high quality, he said, but their other wares are exorbitant
                            (probably referring to helicopters and tanks).</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Shah expressed his conviction that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>

                            He also reiterated his long-held view that Iran must take care of itself
                            and that Iran itself is in better position to ascertain its military
                            requirements than outsiders. He noted that five-year military plan is
                            being worked out with <gloss target="#t_ARMISHMAAG1"

                            understand American hesitation to sell arms to credit worthy country
                            like Iran which has almost entirely American-oriented military

                        <item>Shah expressed great concern over influx of Soviet arms to Arab

                        <item>I did my best to urge Shah to keep military expenditures to minimum,
                            noting wastefulness of Arab military build-up and lesson taught by

                            Conference Committee re military credit sales. Shah said he willing to

                            feasible we should not be surprised if he places orders

                        <item>State and Defense have reviewed problems posed by (a) order deadline
                            of December 1968 for 10 C–130 aircraft desired by Iran and (b) Iranian
                            desire have third and fourth squadrons of F–4's delivered by end

                        <item>Under existing policy, we see no choice except to include C–130
                            aircraft in sixth (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968) tranche. We
                            cannot permit <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> order these aircraft
                            in expectation credit funds will be forthcoming because decision on
                            credit comes only after annual review. Cash purchase of this magnitude
                            also must await annual review or special authorization. Including
                            C–130's in sixth tranche can be accomplished by reducing number of
                            Sheridans to 16 at $10 million. We reluctant postpone purchase of M–60
                            tanks because this would undoubtedly lose present favorable

                            possible funding programs suggest themselves: (a) ordering all 32

                            would absorb all of planned credit in seventh (<gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        <item>Our present policy, however, precludes our adopting either of these
                            suggestions. Under present policy, we cannot commit ourselves to more
                            than one year's financing each year following annual review. Funding of
                            F–4's per para 3 above implies commitment to future year funding because
                            first increment would fund only part of equipment needed for a squadron
                            and implies obligation continue funding in future. In addition,
                            suggestion (a) would preempt entire seventh tranche and postpone funding
                            of other items, such as NIMCOMS, Sheridans, Persian Gulf defense items
                            as recommended by <persName>Richmond</persName> report and other items
                            which have high priority for Iranians. Suggestion (b) would require
                            postponing items from sixth tranche in addition to Sheridans or decision
                            sell C–130's for cash; the latter being unacceptable under current
                            policy as mentioned in para 2 above.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Another possibility would be raising planning ceiling for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 program above $100 million. This
                            would require policy change, including Congressional consultations, and
                            might in any case not be possible given present limitations on credit
                            availabilities.</item>

                        <item>In absence compelling political justification we are reluctant
                            undertake steps to alter present policy. We note in this connection
                            recent sharp decline in Iranian foreign exchange reserves. We question
                            desirability change in policy so soon after Shah's <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trip. In any case, policy
                            reconsideration could not be undertaken without reviewing political
                            factors and completing economic study, which would have to take into
                            account forthcoming <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> reports.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Another alternative is of course to postpone delivery fourth squadron.
                            Under this alternative, third squadron could be funded in seventh
                            tranche and fourth in eighth tranche, and additional funds would be
                            available in both tranches for other high priority items even if ceiling
                            remained at $100 million each year. Principal difficulty with this
                            alternative, in addition postponement delivery of fourth squadron until
                            1972, would be fact fourth squadron could cost an additional $4–$10
                            million.</item>

                            increase in $100 million ceiling, or substantial cash purchases in

                            preceding seventh (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969) tranche. When
                            does Embassy believe economic data will be available? (c) Impact on
                            Iran's force structure and political-economic factors involved in
                            postponement delivery fourth F–4 squadron to 1972. (d) Substitution of
                            C–130's for Sheridans (except 16) in sixth tranche.</item>

                        reasons for continuing to plan on the basis of $100 million in annual U.S.
                        military credits to Iran. However, the economic study points out several
                        problem areas for the future and recommends that these be kept under review.
                        Our recommendation is, therefore, that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1970 budget estimate for military credit sales to Iran should be set at $100
                        million, up to half of which might be from commercial credit funds as
                        indicated in the attached report of the financial study group. The final
                        figure would be subject to the results of the annual military, economic and

                        Iran will be in the United States on an official visit beginning Tuesday,
                        December 3, 1968. He has expressed a desire to call on President-elect
                            Nixon.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">A handwritten notation on the source
                            text reads: “Nixon will NOT see. <persName>RHoudek</persName>.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister met Mr. <persName>Nixon</persName> in Tehran on April 22,
                        1967 when they were both guests at a dinner at the home of the Iranian
                        Foreign Minister. During that visit, Mr. <persName>Nixon</persName> also had
                        lunch with the Shah.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> strongly recommends that the
                        President-elect receive the Prime Minister. Our interests in Iran would be
                        well served by such an indication that the new Administration will want to
                        maintain our close ties with Iran. These interests include our ability to
                        influence an increasingly powerful Iran to play a constructive role in the
                        Middle East and Persian Gulf and our ability to retain certain strategic
                        intelligence facilities whose importance is increasing as our facilities in
                        Pakistan are being closed down. Should the President-elect not see the Prime
                        Minister the Shah is likely to be concerned that the new Administration may
                        not want to continue our present intimate relationship with Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister will be in New York on December 4, in Washington December
                        5 and 6, in Florida December 7 and 8 and in Los Angeles December 9–11 and
                        would be available for a meeting with the President-elect on any of those
                        dates.</p>

                            Shah wanted to know why Iran could not get M–60 replacements for its own
                            older models. Secretary said he did not think M–60s were involved but he

                            First, was that US buy Iranian oil for Vietnam and sequester proceeds
                            which could be used for Iranian arms purchase in this country. Second,
                            was that US should buy Iranian oil for stockpiling. Secretary said he
                            would ask his colleagues consider latter suggestion which he had not
                            heard of before.</item>

                            without much success for what was behind this suggestion but got
                            impression Shah feels that undue American support for Saudi Arabia would
                            create problems of prestige in the Middle East for Iran. Net impression
                            Secretary received was that Shah rather hoping that US will pick Iran as
                            its “chosen instrument” in the Middle East.</item>

                        meet with him during his US visit next month. President-elect hopes that
                        PriMin will understand that during next few weeks he must devote his full
                        time and attention to preparing for his administration. He has therefore
                        decided that he will not be able to receive any foreign visitors in this
                        period. You may tell PriMin that President-elect remembers with pleasure his
                        talks with the PriMin in Tehran in April 1967, that he has warm admiration
                        for the PriMin and for his role in Iran's great progress in recent years,
                        that he looks forward to strengthening the already close ties between our
                        two countries and that he very much regrets not being able to meet with the
                        PriMin in December.</p>

                    <p>7433. Subject: Military Sales to Iran. Summary. Shah's complaint about
                        projected delay in delivery of Sheridan tanks has been seized as opportunity
                        for trying to divert him from virtual obsession with date of Dec. 31, 1971.
                        That is date when British will have withdrawn from Persian Gulf. In effect
                        Shah is trying to compress 5-year military purchasing into intervening three
                        years. Specifically, case was made for deferring <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565"
                            facs="0593"/>delivery schedule of fourth F–4 squadron. Shah was
                        non-committal except to attach hope to oil barter deals with GM and other
                        American companies.</p>

                        <item>After noting 16 Sheridans included in sixth tranche, Shah 23rd
                            expressed concern that additional Sheridans not projected for delivery
                            until 1972 or later. Suggesting General <persName>Twitchell</persName>
                            more familiar with technical aspects such as two-year lead time, I said
                            Shah's question, however, raises broader issue of future program
                            projection.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Describing as understandable his keen interest in end of 1971 target
                            date (when British will have withdrawn from Gulf), I said in effect he
                            is trying to compress five-year military program into three years. This
                            in turn is incompatible with our projected $100 million annual credit
                            availability. Shah agreed this is problem, adding if choices have to be
                            made his air force and navy needs must come first.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I said I wondered whether precise date of December 31, 1971, is all
                            that critical. Iran's military strength is obviously capable of handling
                            any currently envisaged threat in Gulf area. Moreover, if threat arises
                            it will probably be as result of ferment of several years after British
                            leave.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Thus I questioned whether having both third and fourth F–4 squadrons
                            on hand by end of 1971 is really necessary. Shah himself had observed at
                            Lavan Island that Iran's international prestige has soared as result of
                            news that Iran has Phantoms. As <persName corresp="#p_KHJ1"
                                >Kuss</persName> had said, their chief value is deterrence through
                            “eye impact”. It seemed to me that essentially this objective can be
                            served as well by three squadrons as by four by the end of 1971.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>I told Shah I not questioning military value of four squadrons but
                            merely whether their delivery might not be spaced out so as to give us
                            elbow room to include in future tranches, if they are approved, other
                            items which are important to five-year program. Meanwhile, we would be
                            keeping options open for such things as possibly acquiring rehab F–4's
                            after Viet Nam conflict ceases.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Shah's response tended to center on his confidence that oil barter
                            deal with US companies may come to fruition. He obviously places great
                            hope in Jim Zand's proposals for exchanges with General
                                <persName>Motors</persName>, adding that one of attractive aspects
                            is GM will give sizeable discounts on hardware it sells. In short, he
                            has vaguely in mind getting Sheridans via barter deals which he contends
                            would be incremental to normal Iranian imports from US.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>In addition to financial bind, I told Shah there is always problem of
                            human resources. He readily agreed, commenting this is point with which
                            he cannot argue. I pointed out still to arrive are 155 M–60 tanks whose
                            payment included in sixth tranche. According to General
                                <persName>Twitchell</persName>, I said, absorption capability of
                            ground forces for tank is already over-<pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566"
                                facs="0594"/>strained. Shah indicated agreement but did not
                            necessarily agree to translate this into lengthy delay in receipt of
                            Sheridans.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>In concluding general argument for easing up pressure to crowd as much
                            hardware as possible in before end of 1971, I told Shah he should take
                            long-view. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has treated him well in
                            past and all indicators are good for future. <gloss target="#t_FMS1"
                                >FMS</gloss> legislation has been passed. Thanks to deliberations re
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>, our Congressional friends, as
                            reflected in several personal letters I have received, are now more
                            fully conscious of Shah's fine leadership as well as Iran's needs.
                            Furthermore, his good friend, from whom only previous day he had
                            received warm telegram, will be in White House. In a sense, I said, when
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> made tough decision to let Iran
                            buy Phantoms (first foreign release except for Britain), it was
                            political decision. We betting on Shah to continue to exercise, as Nixon
                            said in his telegram, “constructive statesmanship
                            internationally”.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: While all the points were made,
                            discussion was not as neat and articulate as reported above, for Shah
                            kept interrupting and going off on tangents. Therefore, it was a
                            no-decision affair. But in my view ground has been prepared and perhaps
                            seed planted. I pointed out that with sixth tranche out of way we now
                            have time to ponder these things while undertaking next annual review
                            and determining seventh tranche next June. Shah corrected me to say F–4
                            order must be placed by May.</item>

                            British forces are scheduled to leave the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>You might respond that within the bounds set by Congressional authority
                            and appropriations, you expect our military cooperation with Iran will
                            continue. On specific problems, you might say that they are being
                            communicated to us through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                                >Meyer</persName> and that you expect they will be considered during
                            our joint annual review of our military credit sales program this coming
                            spring. You might say that while we understand Iran's concern for the
                            security of the Gulf, Iran's military strength is capable of handling
                            any currently envisaged threat in that area. Any acceleration of
                            presently planned Iranian military procurement or compression of the
                            planned program into less than five years would not only have economic
                            and financial implications but would also not seem to be warranted by
                            the military situation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister may ask assistance for Iran to sell additional oil to
                            the United States under barter arrangements, to sell additional oil
                            products for our Far Eastern Defense forces or even to sell oil directly
                            to a U.S. stockpile.</p>
                        <p>You might respond that sales of oil to the United States are governed by
                            our oil import policy under which import quotas are given to domestic
                            refiners and not to foreign countries. Increased participation in the
                            American market for Iranian oil can best be obtained by Iran's ensuring,
                            in collaboration with the producing companies, that Iranian oil is
                            economically attractive to those American refiners who have import
                            allocations. Likewise, the Department of Defense purchases oil products
                            on the basis of competitive bidding, and if Iranian companies can supply
                            the required quantities at competitive prices, the Department of Defense
                            would be pleased to purchase them. There are no plans at the present
                            time for either civilian or military stockpiling of petroleum or
                            petroleum products in the United States.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President welcomed the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister extended
                        the Shah's greetings. The Shah had asked him to express his hope that the
                        President and Mrs. Johnson would have an opportunity to visit Iran again
                        soon. The Prime Minister went on to express appreciation that the “American
                        Government under your leadership” had always extended the support Iran
                        needed. He felt Iran is on the right track and “things seem bright.” “What
                        we need is peace in the world; we have stability at home.” There are no
                        problems between Iran and the U.S. We have been good friends. The U.S. has
                        supported Iran's development, and the time has come to broaden economic
                        relations between the two countries. He hoped that more US firms would come
                        to work in Iran. “Development is not only government-to-government business
                        but concerns the peoples of our countries as well. Iran has all the
                        facilities for investment of capital and feels that if private firms make
                        money, Iran makes money.”</p>
                    <p>The President said that is a very enlightened viewpoint. As a result, he felt
                        development will come more rapidly. He said he did not know any country—and
                        he has been in dozens—where the leadership has been wiser or more effective.
                        “Some people talk about development. Some people do it.” The Prime Minister
                        said that if Iran continues at its present speed, it will double <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> in seven years. Iran is even reaching the
                        point where it could begin to think about assisting its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>The President said that Iran could be a constructive force for peace. The
                        Prime Minister said that the state of the world compels Iran to responsible
                        leadership. Irresponsible leadership could lead to war. Iran must provide
                        its people the insurance that military strength gives. Iran has to modernize
                        its forces. The Iranian taxpayer expects this kind of security. But equally
                        important, the defense of an area should be the burden of the people of the
                        area. Iran has no interest in attacking anyone. <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570"
                            facs="0598"/>Iran understands that the British have to leave the Persian
                        Gulf. “I don't say we appreciate it, but we understand it. Now it is up to
                        the people of the Persian Gulf, and their understanding and cooperation can
                        provide stability there.” One of the problems is that some of the regimes on
                        the other side of the Gulf are unstable. He mentioned principally Iraq but
                        also Syria and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He said “we have to
                        look for peace and count on it. We have to build the monument of peace.”
                        This is the policy the Shah has followed.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister continued, saying that relations between Iran and the U.S.
                        have developed nicely. Never in my four years as Prime Minister has there
                        been any serious problem with the U.S. We have been real friends—not only in
                        days of happiness but in difficult days. He is happy that Iran does not need
                        any more grant aid but he is thankful for continuing US support with Iran's
                        military development and for the presence of the US military mission in
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister hoped that the seventh tranche in the military sales
                        program could be signed as soon as possible. That includes two squadrons of
                        Phantoms. The area is more and more filled with armament and one never knows
                        whose hand is on the trigger. The Prime Minister said we usually have an
                        economic review before signing new military sales agreements. “I have many
                        people with me and they will be happy to sit down in the Pentagon and have
                        this review.” He specifically mentioned Iran's need for more technicians “on
                        levels 7 and 9.” Iran is preparing its own manpower and needs this help. The
                        Prime Minister recalled that the Shah had raised the question of oil during
                        his last visit. Arrangements are progressing and Iran knows that a new oil
                        import quota for it is out of the question but hopes that maybe something
                        can be worked out within the existing quota.</p>
                    <p>He mentioned that South Africa was stock-piling oil in its old empty coal
                        mines. He would like to raise this possibility with the US Government in
                        hopes that the US might buy from Iran for this purpose. Iran would also like
                        to sell more JP–4 fuel for the US Navy and is ready to make certain
                        concessions on price.</p>
                    <p>The President said that our people will be “happy and willing to explore” all
                        these matters while the Prime Minister is here.</p>
                    <p>The President said further that, while he will be in Government only a short
                        time longer and could not speak for the next administration, he believed
                        that U.S. interests are such that a close relationship between the U.S. and
                        Iran will continue. He understood that President-elect Nixon had already
                        sent a message to the Shah saying this. “We want to do all we can to
                        help.”</p>
                    <p>The President further said that we planned to continue our role in Iran's
                        military development as far as Congress will permit. The President <pb
                            n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0599"/>said he had always been concerned
                        that Iran's military expenses not become so great as to undercut economic
                        development.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said, “There I can assure you that they are balanced.” The
                        Prime Minister said Iran understands the importance of keeping these things
                        in balance. Disarmament is the ultimate key to these problems and Iran would
                        be happy to disarm tomorrow if that were possible. The President said that
                        we were trying to work along these lines with the Soviet Union. The Prime
                        Minister said that the cost of one plane could build three hospitals. But,
                        he asked rhetorically, “What is the use of the hospitals if you do not have
                        the planes to protect them?”</p>
                    <p>The President said that we cannot change our oil import policy but we would
                        certainly consider the purchase of Iranian products wherever their prices
                        are competitive. We favor whatever barter arrangements Iran can work out
                        with the private U.S. companies and hope that Iran can increase its
                        opportunities that way. The President said that there may be a time when the
                        U.S. will not be in the same position it is now on oil and we may have to do
                        what South Africa is doing. We are fortunate to have friends like Iran.
                        [Comment: The implication was friends who have oil if we need it some
                            day.]<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">All brackets are in the source
                            text.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President said that in the years left to him he hoped he could return to
                        Iran. He remembered the warm welcome he had received there and expressed the
                        deep affection he felt for the Iranian people. He expected to be busy in the
                        next couple of years with his library but he expected that he and Mrs.
                        Johnson would have time to travel. He hoped that the Prime Minister would
                        tell His Majesty the Shah that the President recalls the “gorgeous”
                        reception the Johnsons had received on their last visit to Tehran and he is
                        looking forward to seeing Iran again and to going out in the countryside and
                        seeing how Iran's land reform program has gone.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he hoped the President would keep his promise and
                        “come and see us.” The people of Iran have “the greatest regard for your
                        courage.” He spoke of how the people in Iran had watched the March 31 speech
                        on television and felt “a great deal of tension” [<hi rend="italic"
                            >comment</hi>: presumably over the thought that the President would
                        leave office]. He spoke of the President's great responsibilities for the
                        peace of the world and how greatly Iranians had appreciated his handling of
                        those responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had made every effort not to expand the war in
                        Southeast Asia by involving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or
                        Communist China. At the same time, he could not stand by and let aggression
                        go unopposed. The only US objective is to see the people of the area
                        determine their own future. <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0600"/>The US
                        will come home as soon as that is possible. We don't want to change
                        governments or destroy North Vietnam or kill another person.</p>
                    <p>The President said people from all over the US would be coming to the dinner
                        for the Prime Minister tonight. This was the next to last official visit
                        during his Administration and it turns out that the last two—Iran and
                        Kuwait—are with neighbors and good friends.</p>
                    <p>The conversation turned again to the Iranian economy. The President asked
                        about Iran's agricultural and land development. The Prime Minister said the
                        Shah is never satisfied with Iran's achievements. The President referred to
                        his remarks at the arrival ceremony and said that the key to development is
                        the human process he had described there—the distribution of the land and
                        education and, above all, giving the father the hope that his son's life can
                        be just a little bit richer than his own. Once you get human beings involved
                        this way, you have something very exciting going.</p>
                    <p>The President promised to review his conversation with the Prime Minister
                        with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> later in the day and would
                        encourage them to be as helpful as possible.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister returned to the question of peace and stability in his
                        part of the world. He mentioned a disturbing report that the Iraqis are
                        trying to develop a capacity to wage germ warfare. The Soviets had refused
                        help, but the Iraqis are approaching Bulgaria now. The thought of germ
                        warfare in the hands of such an unstable government made him shudder.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what the population of Iran is now, and the Prime
                        Minister replied, “close to 26 million” with a 2.7% growth rate. He said his
                        government had launched a highly successful family planning program without
                        fanfare—“we have done it without talking about it, without fuss.” The
                        problem is not that they don't want more Iranians, he said, but they want
                        better balance in the population since 48% of the population is now ages
                        0–14.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about fertilizer use. The Prime Minister said Iran is
                        building new plants, one with Allied Chemical. Iran in a recent six-month
                        program had demonstrated the capacity to increase its rice crop from 2–1/2
                        tons per hectare to 4–1/2 tons. When the Prime Minister mentioned Allied
                        Chemical, the President checked and said that Mr. <persName>John
                            Connor</persName> of Allied would be at the dinner tonight. The
                        President described a new liquid feed Allied had developed that the
                        President had tried on his Ranch.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister, picking up the President's description of the liquid
                        feed, said Iran is now trying to develop protein products from oil. He cited
                        the problem of land erosion that arises when animals are allowed to
                        overgraze on the grasslands and agreed with the President that it is
                        important to find other means of feeding until the grass is established. The
                            <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0601"/>President commented that
                        fertilizing these lands to get grass started is expensive, but the results
                        justify the expense. He gave an example of his experience in starting grass
                        on some of his own eroded land in Texas.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that it had been called to his attention in
                        connection with the recent monetary crisis that Iran had not yet ratified
                        the Special Drawing Rights Amendment to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                            >IMF</gloss>. The President pointed out that the amendment would not go
                        into effect until 67 countries with 80% of the votes had ratified it. The US
                        had been among the first to ratify. He very much hoped Iran would ratify in
                        the near future. The Prime Minister took a piece of paper out of his pocket,
                        made a note and said he would look into it.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said further that the recent monetary crisis had been
                        distressing. He told the President that President
                            <persName>DeGaulle</persName>, whom the Prime Minister had just seen in
                        Paris on the way to Washington, had been grateful for the President's
                        message at the height of the franc crisis. The Prime Minister had asked
                        President <persName>DeGaulle</persName> what he thought the results of his
                        monetary reform program would be, and <persName>DeGaulle</persName> had
                        declined to predict. The President explained how he had come to send the
                        message to <persName>DeGaulle</persName>, saying that it was a word of
                        encouragement at a difficult time for <persName>DeGaulle</persName> and not
                        a recommendation or endorsement of his program. Once
                            <persName>DeGaulle</persName> had crossed the bridge of decision, the
                        President felt our role was to help him succeed rather than to make life
                        difficult for him.</p>
                    <p>The President then invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                            Rostow</persName> to bring in Dr. <persName>Henry Kissinger</persName>
                        to meet the Prime Minister. The President informed Dr.
                            <persName>Kissinger</persName> that he had told the Prime Minister that
                        he felt close relations would continue to exist between the US and Iran in
                        the new administration. The President cited President-elect Nixon's message
                        to the Shah saying this. Dr. <persName>Kissinger</persName> said that he had
                        “spoken to Mr. <persName>Nixon</persName> about Iran yesterday” and he could
                        reiterate Mr. <persName>Nixon</persName>'s earlier words to the Shah today
                        in behalf of the President-elect. The President told the Prime Minister that
                        Dr. <persName>Kissinger</persName> had served both Republican and Democratic
                        Presidents faithfully and well and that the US is fortunate and proud to
                        have men of his stature who lend their great abilities to the Government
                        regardless of partisan positions. The President then told the Prime Minister
                        that he would be talking further with him this evening and would be glad to
                        take up any further issues that might emerge in the course of the Prime
                        Minister's discussion here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: The discussion flowed easily. The Prime
                        Minister was relaxed, informal, responsive and friendly. The President spoke
                        with warmth and good feeling about his past and present relations with the
                        Shah and other Iranian leaders. They had no trouble keeping the conversation
                            <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0602"/>moving, and one could only
                        judge the meeting thoroughly satisfactory on both sides.</p>

                    <p>The Prime Minister asked the new Managing Director of the Plan Organization,
                        former Central Bank Governor <persName>Mehdi Samii</persName>, to join the
                        discussion and to raise certain matters connected with our military sales
                        program for Iran. He explained that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1"
                            >Samii</persName> would, in his new job, continue to be responsible for
                        military credit negotiations with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> said that Iran needs to
                        place orders for the additional two squadrons of F–4 aircraft it desires in
                        order to have these squadrons delivered by the end of 1971 when the British
                        forces leave the Persian Gulf. A problem arises, however, because the
                        planning ceiling of $100 million for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1969 (seventh) credit tranche will not be sufficient to cover the <pb
                            n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0603"/>F–4's and other requirements. He
                        asked if there could be some flexibility, for example exceeding in this year
                        the planning ceiling. As an alternative, he mentioned the possibility of
                        spreading out the credit requirements. (Comment: Here he was clearly
                        referring to what we would term “incremental funding.“) In addition to the
                        F–4's, he mentioned the need to fund 100 additional Sheridan tanks, 200
                        recoilless guns and communications equipment in the seventh tranche.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> also said that we have
                        informed Iran that after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 it must
                        purchase all the ammunition previously supplied on a grant basis despite the
                        fact that the 1966 amendment to our 1964 Memorandum of Understanding
                        extended our grant program an additional two years. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1"
                            >Eliot</persName> stated that the 1966 amendment of the 1964
                        Understanding extended the credit but not the grant program beyond <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he recognizes that it is necessary to think ahead but
                        that our Congressional requirements make it necessary for us to plan on an
                        annual basis. He said that if Iran wishes to increase the size of a tranche,
                        we would have to ascertain whether the understanding between us would be
                        firm over a number of years, so that we wouldn't find ourselves being asked
                        to increase later tranches and hence being asked to increase the total
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> said that if we can reach an
                        agreement on a total program, there would be no need to increase the size of
                        later tranches.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that some of this may be easier for us in later years
                        after the end of the war in Vietnam. He stressed that there is one serious
                        aspect of the matter that must be kept in mind. Although we of course do not
                        wish to infringe on the sovereignty of Iran, our ability to obtain the
                        resources we need for this program depends on our examining the relationship
                        between Iran's military and development expenditures. The Secretary said he
                        understood the Government of Iran would be supplying us with some
                        figures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> expressed the hope that we
                        could advance the timing of our review of the economic factors. Hopefully,
                        reports now being prepared by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and
                        the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> could serve as a basis. The Central
                        Bank of Iran would also supply some data. All this information should become
                        available in December.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> said that the
                        economic review has usually taken place in the spring. He said that there
                        are two important problems to be considered. One is whether incremental
                        funding is possible. The other is whether the fourth squadron of F–4's is
                        really needed by the end of 1971. He asked whether delivery of the fourth
                        squadron could be put off a year. This would assist solution not only of
                        financial but also of manpower problems.</p>
                    <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0604"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it would be useful if the economic figures could be
                        made available as soon as possible so that he could brief his successor. He
                        doubted it would be possible to have formal negotiations within the next few
                        weeks but said he would like to discuss the matter with his successor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> said that the annual
                        economic review has become a normal thing. The reports due from the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                            >IMF</gloss> in December and January will cover the economic situation
                        pretty thoroughly. In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"
                            >Meyer</persName>'s remarks, he said that he did not believe that
                        delivery of the fourth squadron of F–4's could be postponed because once the
                        British leave the Persian Gulf, Iran had to be ready for anything. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> interjected that there
                        was nothing four squadrons could do that three couldn't do at that time. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMM1">Samii</persName> reiterated that the fourth
                        squadron was not just for “window dressing.” The Prime Minister added that
                        Iran must be able to have teeth available.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Ansary</persName> then mentioned that
                        the Iranian Air Force also has a requirement for additional technicians at
                        higher levels and asked if they could be made available. He said that the
                        requirement is for more than the 50 the <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                            >USAF</gloss> has already made available and perhaps goes as high as

                        F–4's.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we will look into this matter. He said that it
                        presented no great problem in principle but posed a practical problem. He
                        concluded this part of the discussion by saying that our military people on
                        both sides might wish to review the military contingencies to see how many
                        squadrons of F–4's are really needed.</p>

                    <p>The Prime Minister asked Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> to join the meeting
                        for a discussion of oil matters. He said that Iran has no problems in the
                        current year with the Oil Consortium but that it hopes for one billion
                        dollars in oil revenues next year. (<hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>:
                        presumably the Iranian year beginning March 21, 1969.) The member companies
                        of the Consortium are considering this request, but have not yet responded.
                        Last year, he said, the Shah told the companies that if they could not meet
                        Iran's requirements, Iran would find its own markets. He decried what he
                        described as the companies' policy of supporting such states as Abu Dhabi
                        and Kuwait that either have no useful way to employ their oil revenues or
                        use them to support radical Arabs.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that Iran is now looking at the American
                        market. One way to sell oil to the United States would be through the
                        present American quota system, using the proceeds to purchase American
                        goods. Iran might possibly buy into an American firm having an import quota.
                        In any case, the Prime Minister said, two aspects of this situation deserved
                        special mention. One is the fact that the United States needs additional oil
                        reserves. Iran has entered into a contract with another country (comment:
                        South Africa; see below) desirous of stockpiling oil and has asked a private
                        firm for a study on a similar possible contract with the United States. Iran
                        would give this study to the United States Government for its consideration.
                        Iran could use the proceeds from such sales to the United States to buy
                        American products. The second aspect of the matter was possible sales of
                        petroleum products to the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0606"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> said that sales to the Department of Defense
                        pose a problem because <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> purchases on the
                        basis of public tender. The Secretary asked if Dr.
                            <persName>Fallah</persName> meant that Iran could not meet the price
                        competition. Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> said that the National Iranian
                        Oil Company (<gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss>) would act as the
                        Consortium's agent. The Prime Minister said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> would find a market for the Consortium.
                        The <gloss target="#t_NIOC1">NIOC</gloss> would make no money as an agent,
                        but Iran would profit through the taxes the Consortium would pay on higher
                        production. Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> said that Iran desires a
                        three-year contract with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, but the latter
                        won't go beyond six months. This and not price is the problem. The Prime
                        Minister said that Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> would be talking with
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> officials. The Secretary said that
                        we can be sympathetic provided that the price is right, but we do not want
                        to subsidize the seller.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> said that on the other aspect of the Iranian
                        plan to sell oil to the United States, Iran believes that it is in the US
                        interest to buy inexpensive Iranian oil. The Secretary asked how such
                        purchases would be financed. He said that he couldn't imagine the Congress
                        financing an oil stockpile. Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName> said that at
                        some time in the future, the United States, like South Africa, might finance
                        a stockpile. Iran could provide credit for that part of the sale whose
                        proceeds would go to Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that from the standpoint of national resources policy
                        there was some logic in the Iranian proposal. But to translate the proposal
                        into financial and political terms would be difficult. He asked if such a
                        proposition might not be more attractive for Western Europe. Dr.
                            <persName>Fallah</persName> replied that Western Europe is already a
                        market for Iranian oil. The Secretary commented that in our case, the
                        proposal would appear to hurt our own producers who wouldn't trust their
                        government to keep the stockpile locked up. Dr. <persName>Fallah</persName>
                        said that the major American companies would like the proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was interested in the subject and would give it more
                        thought, but there are political and financial problems. Dr.
                            <persName>Fallah</persName> said that Alaskan finds are not the
                        permanent answer to American oil needs and added that the Iranian proposal
                        would not hurt the American balance of payments. The Secretary repeated that
                        the proposal is politically very difficult. He asked that Iran provide us
                        with its studies informally and that future discussions be on an informal
                        basis.</p>

                    <p>289317. For Charge. If you are questioned about fact President-elect did not
                        receive Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HAA1">Hoveyda</persName> but
                        subsequently received Israeli Defense Minister <persName>Dayan</persName>
                        and the <persName>Amir</persName> of Kuwait, you should say that you have no
                        information on this subject. If pressed for explanation by high-level
                        Iranian officials, you can suggest they await return of Ambassador <persName

                        position to discuss this matter with the Prime Minister.<note n="2"
