                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory
                    charter for the preparation of the series. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                        >P.L.</gloss> 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's
                    Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M.
                        Nixon</persName> and Gerald R. Ford. The sub-series presents in multiple
                    volumes a comprehensive documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    actions of the administrations of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and Ford. This specific volume documents <pb n="IV"

                    Southeast Asia: Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, 1969–1972, a period
                    when the future of Southeast Asia was a major concern of American foreign policy
                    makers.</p>

                    Relations, 1969–1976, Volume XX</p>
                <p>This is the last print volume to document U.S. policy towards Southeast Asia,
                    other than those print volumes that document the Vietnam War during the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>–Ford administrations. For the
                    January 1973 to January 1977 period, U.S. policy towards Southeast Asia (nations
                    other than Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) is covered in an electronic-only volume.
                    The decision to cover Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia for 1969–1972 in
                    detail in this print volume was based on the fact that each country was a key
                    ally—either formally or de facto—of the United States during the Vietnam war,
                    and each played a specific role during the conflict. Thailand sent troops to
                    fight in Vietnam, provided bases for U.S. airpower in Southeast Asia, and
                    secretly provided training, troops, and arms to support U.S.-backed guerrilla
                    forces in Laos. The Philippines sent a 2,000-man civic action group to South
                    Vietnam, and Filipinos made up many of the administrative contractors in South
                    Vietnam. Indonesia provided key arms support to the <persName corresp="#p_LN2"
                        >Lon Nol</persName> government at a crucial time. In addition, Thailand, the
                    Philippines, and Indonesia were important countries in their own right, with key
                    U.S. military and economic assistance programs, large embassies, and close
                    relations with the United States. In each country, the United States had a
                    considerable interest in their government's success.</p>
                <p>The chapter on Thailand, the largest in the volume, has the most obvious and
                    closest associations with the Vietnam war. A principal theme of this chapter is
                    U.S. efforts to assure the Thais that unilateral withdrawal of U.S. troops from
                    South Vietnam and a projected settlement of the war did not mean a lesser U.S.
                    commitment to Thailand. These efforts were difficult due to congressional
                    investigations into the U.S. relationship with Thailand and charges that there
                    were secret understandings and commitments. Another development that concerned
                    the Thais was the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine of 1969,
                    which led them to think that the United States was withdrawing from the area. A
                    second key theme of the volume is the covert military role that Thailand's
                    military forces played in supporting the anti-communist forces in Laos and the
                    potential role they could play in supporting the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                        Nol</persName> government in Cambodia. The presence of the Thai Division
                    fighting in Vietnam and whether it could be used elsewhere is yet another
                    related theme. As U.S. troops withdrew from South Vietnam, Thailand, after some
                    consideration, moved to draw down its own forces. Other themes covered in the
                    chapter are less directly related to the conflict in Indochina: the <pb n="V"
                        xml:id="pg_V" facs="0006"/>fate of parliamentary government in Thailand,
                    U.S. economic and military assistance, U.S. concern over the insurgency in
                    northeast Thailand, rice sales, imports of Thai textiles to the United States,
                    and efforts to prevent drug production and interdict drug trafficking in
                    Thailand.</p>
                <p>The second largest chapter in this volume documents U.S. policy towards the
                    Philippines. The relationship between President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2"
                        >Ferdinand Marcos</persName> and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration is the dominant theme of this chapter. U.S.
                    officials had to assure <persName>Marcos</persName> that they were neutral in
                    the 1969 Philippines presidential elections and discourage his desire for a
                    special channel to Washington. Corruption in the <persName>Marcos</persName>
                    government, <persName>Marcos</persName>'s desire to revise the constitution to
                    his benefit, and his eventual declaration of martial law in September 1972 in
                    the face of student riots caused U.S. officials in Manila and Washington to
                    assess whether he was the best man to lead the Philippines from the U.S. point
                    of view. It was in Washington's interest to have “more flags in South Vietnam,”
                    so the fate of the Philippines Civic Action Group in South Vietnam was a key
                    issue between Washington and Manila. The Group's fate was affected both by
                    general U.S.-Philippines relations, the unilateral U.S. troop withdrawals from
                    Vietnam, and U.S. congressional hearings on U.S. commitments in Southeast Asia.
                    Other themes that are documented in the chapter are ones that predate the
                    Vietnam war, such as preference for Philippines exports to the United States,
                    U.S. benefits for Filipino veterans who served in the Second World War, and U.S.
                    bases in the Philippines. The seriousness and threat of insurgency in Central
                    Luzon was an emerging concern. Finally, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>'s insistence that U.S. armed forces stationed in the
                    Philippines be drastically cut caused considerable bureaucratic and political
                    difficulties.</p>
                <p>The final chapter in the volume deals with Indonesia, officially a non-aligned
                    nation, but under strongman General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                        >Suharto</persName>, a de facto ally of the United States. The principal
                    themes of this chapter are the question of Indonesia's international debt left
                    over from the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> years and U.S.
                    support for multilateral Indonesian debt relief among international lending
                    organizations. A related theme is the amount of U.S. bilateral aid provided to
                    Indonesia. Because Indonesia's armed forces used Soviet equipment, the United
                    States asked Indonesia to provide <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss> rifles
                    and ammunition to Cambodian armed forces, which were also armed with Soviet
                    small arms, at a point when the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>
                    government was fighting against North Vietnamese troops. In return, the
                    Indonesians gained from Washington an expanded— although still small—U.S.
                    military assistance program. Generally U.S.-Indonesia relations were good, and
                    Indonesia enjoyed the kind of stability that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration appreciated. There was, however, a dawning
                    realization among the President and his key foreign policy <pb n="VI"
                        xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0007"/>advisers that they too often took Indonesia for
                    granted. As a result, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration made a special effort to consult periodically at a high level
                    with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and other key Indonesian
                    government officials.</p>
                <p>Like all recent <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes, the emphasis of
                    this volume is on policy formulation and on important issues, rather than the
                    day-to-day implementation of policy. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and his Assistant for National Security Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, still dominate the policy
                    process, but the role of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William
                        Rogers</persName> and, in the case of Thailand, Vice President <persName
                        corresp="#p_AST1">Spiro Agnew</persName>, are significant. In Southeast
                    Asia, with the exception of issues relating to the Vietnam war, the
                    Secretary—and Department of State—was granted a larger policy role by the
                    President.</p>
                <p>While the editors believe that this volume stands on its own through the use of
                    annotation and especially editorial notes relating to other volumes, this volume
                    is best read in conjunction with the four <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Vietnam volumes for January 1969–January 1973, volumes
                    VI–IX.</p>

                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the date and time of the
                    conversation, rather than the date a memorandum was drafted. Documents chosen
                    for printing are authoritative or signed copies, unless otherwise noted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor. The documents are reproduced as exactly as
                    possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document
                    included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained
                    as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors are
                    silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected
                    by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in
                    roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the original text are printed in
                    italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original
                    text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII"
                        facs="0008"/>documents withheld for declassification purposes have been
                    accounted for and are listed with headings, source notes, and number of pages
                    not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear in the
                    original text are so identified in footnotes. With the exception of Presidential
                    recordings transcribed in the Office of the Historian for this volume, all
                    ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security, as embodied in
                    law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2002 and was completed in
                    2004, resulted in the decision to withhold 19 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 7 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 48 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that notwithstanding the number of denied and excised
                    documents, the record presented in this volume provides an accurate and
                    comprehensive account of U.S. foreign policy towards, and significant relations
                    with, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the

                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this

                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders

                    sensitive issues with ambassadors in Southeast Asia secretly through backchannel
                    messages without the rest of the foreign affairs bureaucracy's knowledge. These
                    files are of key value.</p>
                <p>Also important in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> files of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials are the <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Institutional Files (H-Files) which are part of
                    the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> files, but not to be confused with the
                    less complete <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Institutional Matters Files.
                    The former contains minutes of National Security Council Meetings, as well as
                    minutes of such key <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> subgroups as the
                    Review/Senior Review Group and the Washington Special Actions Group. For each
                    set of meeting minutes there are corresponding meeting folders that contain the
                    papers that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, who chaired all of
                    these <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> groups, used in preparing for the
                    meeting. Also in the H-Files are the complete set of National Security Study
                    Memoranda (NSSM), National Security Decision Memoranda (NSDM), and related
                    studies and papers. The President used this <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"
                        >NSSM</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> mechanism to generate
                    policy options from the foreign affairs bureaucracy for Indonesia, the
                    Philippines, and Thailand.</p>
                <p>Of second importance in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials are the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Office Files, the Lake
                    Chronological Files, and the <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>
                    Chronological and Special Files, all of which have occasional <pb n="XV"
                        xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0016"/>material of value. The President's Daily brief
                    in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files provides sporadic information
                    on Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, sometimes with handwritten comments
                    or orders by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Finally,
                    the Subject Files of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files including
                    such sub files as <gloss target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss>/<persName
                        corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> Meetings, Presidential
                    Determinations, and <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>
                    Subcommittee often provide documents of value.</p>
                <p>Besides the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Materials include the White House Special
                    Files, including the President's Personal Files with its valuable Memoranda for
                    the President, the President's Office Files, and Staff Members and Office Files.
                    Material on Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand is sprinkled through these
                    files. Also of value are the Presidential tape recordings, <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s secret sound-activated taping system
                    that began in 1971. The volume contains conversations transcribed specifically
                    by the Office of the Historian, primarily relating to the visits of <persName
                        corresp="#p_MFE2">Ferdinand</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Imelda
                        Marcos</persName> of the Philippines to Washington.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers in the Manuscript
                    Division of the Library of Congress often replicate documentation found in other
                    collections, especially the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials, but
                    have some documents unique to that collection. The most useful parts of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers are the
                    Chronological Files, Memoranda of Conversations, Memoranda for the President,
                    and a collection of documents organized by countries under the Geopolitical
                    Files heading. The transcripts of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>'s telephone conversations are in this collection and
                    have a number of conversations about Indonesian aid to Cambodia, especially in
                    May and June 1970. While the original transcripts are not open to the public,
                    Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has allowed the National
                    Archives to make available copies at College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The volume also draws heavily on the records of the Department of State. Along
                    with the President and Vice President, Secretary of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName> had meetings with prime
                    ministers, foreign ministers, and other high-level leaders of Indonesia, the
                    Philippines, and Thailand. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
                    Pacific Affairs <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName> had a keen
                    interest in relations with Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Many records of
                    high-level meetings and communications are in the Department of State Central
                    Files located in Record Group (<gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss>) 59 at the

                        >POL</gloss> 23–8, which are files that contain material on the opposition

                    23–8 THAI files relate mostly to the incipient insurgency in the northeast. Both
                    Thailand and the Philippines contributed troops to the Vietnam war effort and
                    were official members of the so-called Troop Contributing Countries (TCC). The

                <p>Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand were recipients of major U.S. aid

                    numerical sub files are important. Thailand and the Philippines had large U.S.
                    military assistance programs, and Indonesia had an incipient one that was
                    expanding, so DEF(<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>) INDON, DEF(<gloss

                    THAI and their numerical sub-files are also of value. A specific file worthy of
                    mention is DEF 1–1 INDON–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, a file for
                    U.S.-Indonesia military contingency plans, that contains documents on the
                    U.S.-initiated Indonesian effort to provide small arms and ammunition to the
                        <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> government in Cambodia.
                    Another file in which documentation on this issue can be found is <gloss

                        target="#t_US1">US</gloss> contains documents on U.S. bases and
                    installations in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Indonesia suffered from large foreign debt left over from the <persName

                    repay it. Records of consultation and cooperation among Indonesia's creditors
                    are in the FN (financial) series of the Central Files, especially FN1–1 INDON.
                    The question of foreign investment and land ownership in the Philippines was a

                    consolidating a number of Department of State conference files, contain records
                    of the trips of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, <persName

                    records, are valuable, especially for <persName>Johnson</persName>'s service as
                    Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, 1969–1973. This volume relied on
                    Department of State Lot files relating to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                <p>The Subcommittee on United States Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad of

                    in Vietnam, corruption in the Philippines and Thailand, and unwarranted U.S.
                    Government commitments to the Philippines and Thailand. The declassified version

                <p>The Truman administration's concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted

                    Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the same
                    time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certainly was a natural choice
                    but it was assigned this function at least in part because the Agency controlled
                    unvouchered funds, by which operations could be funded with minimal risk of
                    exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="actionsstatementfn1">

                    mandate dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The

                    managing covert actions. The OPC, which was to take its guidance from the

                    direct access to the State Department and to the military without having to

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other

                    initiatives. In April 1951 President Truman created the Psychological Strategy

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s request

                    Committee were low-risk and low-cost operations. The Final Report also cited a

                        <p>513. 1. This morning I called at my suggestion on the Prime Minister<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                    >Thanom Kittikachorn</persName> of Thailand.</note> and took
                            advantage of my prospective visit with Ambassador
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> in Saigon later this week to raise with
                            him questions about important developments in Thailand. Present at our
                            conversation were Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> and Government House Secretary-General, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSG2">Sawaeng</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. I first said that Amb <persName>Johnson</persName> will undoubtedly
                            have been informed in general terms about the insurgency situation and I
                            would like to pass on the Prime Minister's assessment, particularly with
                            regard to the recent intensified action in the three-province area of
                            the North. The Prime Minister replied in rather general terms noting the
                            importance to the counter-insurgency effort of the kind of matériel and
                            equipment which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is providing, both
                            for security forces and for development activities. The Prime Minister
                            specifically mentioned communications equipment for the police, the
                            helicopter delivery schedule, modernization of weapons, and assistance
                            to support programs to improve the livelihood of the hill tribes and we
                            agreed that we would have our respective staffs see that everything
                            necessary was being provided. This gave me an opportunity to emphasize
                            the importance of the Thais making full utilization of equipment already
                            on hand and being sure that they were ready to receive and use on
                            arrival new equipment in the pipeline. I also warmly endorsed the Prime
                            Minister's reference to helping the hill tribes and mentioned to him our
                            impression from discussions in the North that Thai officials had not
                            been given as concrete policy directive concerning their dealings with
                            the hill tribes as would be useful. I emphasized the importance of Thai
                            Government officials recognizing the hill tribe population as part of
                            the <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0051"/>Thai nation and dealing with
                            them in such a way as to make friends and avoid building any additional
                            hostility. The Prime Minister readily agreed with these observations. I
                            also emphasized the importance of collecting more and better
                            intelligence and we noted as a useful first step the setting up of a new
                            JSC in Phitsanulok. In general we concluded that Mr. Tanham will keep in
                            close touch with Generals Surakij and Saiyud and others as pertinent to
                            follow up on these matters.</p>
                        <p>3. I then asked the Prime Minister whether there was anything on the
                            coming elections and he said that there was “nothing worth saying” to
                            Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> at this time, although he
                            indicated his general satisfaction with the way matters were
                            proceeding.</p>
                        <p>4. I then mentioned that the new administration will undoubtedly be
                            occupied with the question of security and <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> military posture with regard to Southeast Asia in the
                            period following a Vietnam settlement. I asked the Prime Minister
                            whether there was any Thai Government thinking on this subject which he
                            would like me to pass on to Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>.
                            After some expressions of concern about the military situation in Laos
                            the Prime Minister in effect passed the ball on this question to Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>. The latter first
                            went through his familiar recitation about American journalists,
                            senators, professors and others who obviously wanted no part of any
                            American presence or activity in this part of the world. Contrary to
                            earlier comments, he did not express confidence about the new
                            administration in this regard. He concluded by saying, with the Prime
                            Minister's agreement, that the Thai Government was not in a position to
                            comment on these matters until the new <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            administration was able to provide some kind of a picture of what will
                            be its security policy for Southeast Asia, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> emphasized that given all the
                            uncertainties of the past many months, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> hopes that clarification on this matter will be
                            available soon. Before we left this subject the Prime Minister
                            volunteered that, with regard to the current situation, Thailand does
                            not need any more <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces; I accepted
                            his point but noted that my question had related to a period following a
                            Vietnam settlement when there would be a new situation.</p>
                        <p>5. At one point in our conversation the Prime Minister referred to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Anderson</persName> article in <hi
                                rend="italic">Parade</hi> and indicated his distress. He seemed to
                            feel that my statement to the press had been helpful and was pleased
                            that I had made my position clear to His Majesty when received in
                            audience last Saturday morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">January

                        </list>
                        <p>After I asked Minister <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> for his
                            assessment of how the election campaign was going and about the
                            prospects for the government party and received some generally
                            optimistic comments, I then proceeded to some specific points. In the
                            first place I mentioned the party image and the fact that to many voters
                            it might be important to know that the government party has a strong
                            civilian component and was not just a party of military men. For this
                            reason it seemed to me important that <persName corresp="#p_PS5"
                                >Pote</persName> and other civilians be brought to the voters'
                            attention so that they are aware of these important civilian elements.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said, as he had before,
                            that he was not very skillful at public rallies, but that he would, for
                            example, be going with the Prime Minister for the opening of several
                            roads in the Northeast which would get a good deal of publicity. He also
                            mentioned a very large meeting he had had awhile back with taxi drivers
                            who have been organized into a kind of mutual benefit cooperative, and
                            he said that when he has some kind of entrée as in this case, he has
                            made efforts to reach the public. I noted that this was a point that
                            could also be covered in campaign literature with pictures and brief
                            reference to his activities.</p>
                        <p>As to election prospects, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>
                            specifically expressed concern about the Northeast, where one-third of
                            the country's population resides and where he feared that Thep and other
                            small parties and independents might be able to pick up considerable
                            support. He said the Northeasterners are congenitally opposed to the
                            establishment and that Thep is also busy trying to win them over by
                            promising to eliminate the rice premium, etc. <persName corresp="#p_PS5"
                                >Pote</persName> explained some of the more abstract economic
                            arguments as to why Thep was wrong, but he acknowledged that these were
                            unlikely to make much of an impact on voters. I said instead that the
                            government party could make it clear what the premium is used <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="pg_4" facs="0053"/>for and how much benefit the farmer gets
                            back from this tax. It was important that all the people being reached
                            by Thep be reached by these counter arguments, whether in person or
                            through graphic handbills or whatever.</p>
                        <p>I expressed concern about the discontented ex-<gloss target="#t_SPT1"
                                >SPT</gloss> members who might be dividing the vote upcountry and
                            thus preventing either the government candidate or themselves from
                            getting into power and opening the way instead to an anti-government
                            candidate. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> acknowledged this
                            problem and I asked whether some of those break-away candidates were now
                            getting support from some of the people in the government party.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said that now that
                            Chamnan is out of the political scene this was not the case. I asked
                            what had happened to Chamnan's well organized political machine in the
                            provinces and <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said that he
                            felt it had lost a good deal of its organization and effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>On party organization <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> averred
                            that headquarters are now being set up in every one of the changwats and
                            they would be appropriately identified and advertised. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> also confirmed in reply to my
                            question that funds had now been provided to all of the candidates and
                            all of the provincial headquarters, along the line he had earlier
                            sketched out to me (see my message of Dec 17 [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]). I emphasized at
                            this point and several other times the importance of candidates in the
                            provinces being well supplied with points of argument and information
                            that they could use effectively with the voters. For example, I said it
                            was very important to the candidate to be able to say what the
                            government had done and what it contemplates doing in that particular
                            area, where projects would have special meaning for those voters.</p>
                        <p>I referred to government party policy and asked whether this would now be
                            disseminated and whether this was related to the Pramane Grounds meeting
                            scheduled for next week. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>
                            confirmed that this was the case, but he minimized the importance of a
                            party policy statement saying that the voter was interested only in very
                            concrete and specific matters and not in broad general principles.</p>
                        <p>I then told <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> I would like to
                            “kibitz” a little bit about the election campaign and pass on to him
                            some thoughts that I had developed on the basis of experience with our
                            own elections in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as well as other
                            areas. I realized that some of these points would have limited or no
                            pertinence to the Thai scene, but I nevertheless would pass them along
                            for what help they might provide. I then reviewed the two memoranda,
                            “Points To Be Made” and “How?”<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">Attached but
                                not printed. The two memoranda outline points to stress for winning

                            <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> listened rather more <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0054"/>carefully than I had anticipated to
                            my review of these points and appeared to take a number of them in. When
                            I had finished he asked to have the papers so that he could translate
                            them into Thai and pass them to a few people who could make good use of
                            them. I said I would give them to him if he liked, but obviously it was
                            very important that a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role of this
                            sort not be known. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said that
                            if they were translated into Thai any appearance of a <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> origin would be removed and that he would
                            bear in mind to restrict use.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the points contained in these two memoranda <persName
                                corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> made a few specific observations of
                            interest. He was particularly receptive of the idea of making full
                            propaganda use of the government's contribution in the economic and
                            social fields and cited many additional specific examples, and agreed
                            with the importance of these accomplishments of the government and
                            future projected accomplishments being brought to public attention. He
                            specifically mentioned a film which we had provided which he would be
                            shortly showing to His Majesty on his return from Chiang Mai, which
                            would then be shown on television all over the country just a week
                            before the elections; this sets forth the Thai Government's
                            accomplishments over recent years. With regard to the Prime Minister,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> mentioned that although
                            he is not very aggressive, he does make a very effective contact with
                            the people and that his modest manner had very considerable appeal to
                            the Thais. On some of the specific Saha Pracha Thai activities,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> indicated that many of
                            these had already been considered and adopted by the party but they were
                            waiting to use some of these until the campaign was further along. He
                            made the point that the party wished to wait long enough so that the
                            other parties would not have an opportunity to answer whatever campaign
                            lines were launched.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> my conversation

                            higher authority on 15 September 1967 after favorable review by the 303
                            Committee. A final review was made on 16 August 1968. Funding which
                            commenced on 31 August 1968 was completed on 4 February 1969. The Thai
                            general elections will be held on 10 February 1969. A general accounting
                            of the use of the funds by category has been obtained by Ambassador

                            recommendation is made that a report on the results of the election be
                            made to the 303 Committee and, if possible, a relationship drawn between
                            the results and the effectiveness of the financial support provided.</p>

                        <p>In June 1965 a final draft constitution for Thailand had been completed
                            providing for general elections which were assumed would be held in mid-
                            or late 1966. With this in mind, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] in June 1965 approached
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA3">Martin</persName> with a request
                            for covert U.S. assistance to be used in conjunction with the upcoming
                            general elections. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA3"
                                >Martin</persName> subsequently proposed to Washington that <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> draw up a program of covert election
                            support with the primary objective being to develop a viable political
                            apparatus in Thailand under the present pro-U.S. leadership and to
                            ensure the continuity of this leadership. A memorandum requesting 303
                            Committee authorization for such a program was presented to the 303
                            Committee on 7 October 1965. It estimated that initial funding
                            requirements would be on the order of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>], <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0056"/>stated
                            that the number of witting Thai officials could probably be kept to six,
                                [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
                            The 303 Committee approved the proposal for the expenditure of [dollar
                            amount not declassified] subject to approval by higher authority which
                            was given on 11 November 1965.</p>
                        <p>The draft constitution of June 1965 was delayed in debate, however, and
                            the proposal remained in abeyance. Following the passing of the third
                            and final reading of the constitution in February 1968, the subject of
                            covert political support was reopened by the Thais. [<hi rend="italic">1

                            based on past commitments. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] was advised that this question would
                            have to be discussed with the Ambassador. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] subsequently discussed the same matter with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> on 22 March
                            1968, noting that he was aware of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                            previously considered. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            emphasized that only [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>], were aware of the previous U.S. commitment.
                            After a series of informal talks, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> requested authority from Washington to proceed
                            with this covert support. After 303 Committee consideration on 16 August
                            1968, a message was sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> from Assistant Secretary of State Mr. <persName

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> to visit Thailand
                            during his trip to Vietnam. Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> was unable to accept the Prime Minister's
                            invitation due to time limitations, the Prime Minister suggested through
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> that I come to
                            Bangkok in his stead. Accordingly, Assistant Secretary Froehlke and I
                            traveled to Bangkok on 9 March. We met with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> and Air Marshal Dawee, Deputy
                            Minister of Defense, at the Prime Minister's residence, for about an
                            hour and a quarter, beginning at 10 A.M. Present at the meeting were
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>, Air Marshal
                            Dawee, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, Deputy
                            Chief of Mission <persName>Hannah</persName>, Major General McCown, the
                            Chief of our Military Assistance Group in Thailand, Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_FRF1">Froehlke</persName> and myself. Air
                            Marshal Dawee acted as interpreter as necessary.</p>
                        <p>2. After the usual pleasantries, I briefed the Prime Minister on the
                            military situation in South Vietnam, using a map, and pointing out that
                            the situation was militarily favorable. I stated that the enemy had
                            achieved no military successes and, contrary to the effects of the Tet
                            offensive of 1968, little or no psychological success. Nevertheless, the
                            enemy had not committed sizeable main force <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> and regular <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>
                            formations; therefore, the enemy continued to have the capability to
                            mount substantial attacks, particularly in the I Corps Tactical Zone and
                            the III Corps Tactical Zone. I observed that General Abrams and his
                            subordinate commanders were confident that they could defeat any
                            initiatives undertaken by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>3. As to the attitude of the South Vietnamese regarding rocket attacks on
                            Saigon, I stated that I had been surprised at the calmness of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>, Prime Minister Huong
                            and General Vien and their feeling that these attacks did not as of the
                            moment constitute a disturbing political factor for the Government of
                            Vietnam. Of course, were these attacks to be continued over a long
                            period of time or if they were <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0058"
                            />increased in magnitude the situation could change radically and
                            suddenly. The Prime Minister appeared to be completely satisfied with my
                            presentation and showed great interest in the location of enemy main
                            combat elements.</p>
                        <p>4. I then asked the Prime Minister if he would be good enough to discuss
                            the insurgency problem in Thailand and to give me the benefit of his
                            thinking as regards the magnitude of the dissidents and the counter
                            action being undertaken by the Thai Government. He responded willingly.
                            He stated that the dissident group in the North was comprised of hill
                            tribesmen who were being subverted by agents from the outside. The group
                            is not large nor does he consider the danger of expansion great so long
                            as the Government moves promptly to suppress the insurgents' efforts. In
                            this connection, he pointed out that the dissident elements were located
                            in very remote and extremely difficult country which required that the
                            insertion of Government forces and their resupply be done by helicopter.
                            He expressed the view, backed up by Air Marshal Dawee, that the Thai
                            forces need more helicopters in order to cope with the threat and to
                            maintain an acceptable number of helicopters at all times ready for
                            operational use. Turning to the dissident problem in southern Thailand
                            he stated that the insurgent group there was also quite small; however
                            their activities were tied in with those of similar Malaysian groups and
                            this complicated the problem. Nevertheless the Thai High Command is now
                            planning with Malaysian officials joint operations against the southern
                            dissident elements.</p>
                        <p>5. The conversation then turned to the need of the Thai forces for more
                            helicopters and for the provision of M–16 rifles. The justification for
                            the latter one was the usual one: the enemy dissidents are better armed
                            with communist-type weapons than are the Thai forces. I responded by
                            citing the production limitations on M–16 rifles and the priority which,
                            of necessity, had to be given the Free World forces in South Vietnam. I
                            added that we were in the process of expanding M–16 production and that
                            it was a matter which could be discussed in the usual channel; namely
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> and General
                            McCown.</p>
                        <p>6. The meeting ended on the same friendly note that had been maintained
                            throughout our interview. The Prime Minister thanked Assistant Secretary
                            of Defense <persName corresp="#p_FRF1">Froehlke</persName> and myself
                            for coming to Bangkok and expressed the hope that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> would be able to visit Thailand
                            at some future time. He also asked me to convey his warm regards to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. After we left the Prime Minister's residence, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> stated that he felt that our
                            meeting had been a great success; the Thais are very sensitive as to
                            their status as one of the troop-contributing nations and are desirous
                            of being able to publicize the visits of ranking <pb n="10"
                                xml:id="pg_10" facs="0059"/>U.S. officials to consult with their
                            leaders regarding the war. The Ambassador's observation was borne out by
                            newspaper articles emanating over the next three days from Bangkok
                            sources.</p>

                        <p>2928. Subject: Message to Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>1. With Field Marshal Thanom already renamed PriMin by the King, expected
                            to announce his new cabinet momentarily, and expected to present his new
                            government's program to joint session of Parliament March 19 or 20, I
                            believe it would be most appropriate for <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> to take formal note of Thailand's installation of a
                            government constitutionally responsible to Parliament. I therefore
                            strongly recommend the President send <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> a message of congratulations on his new
                            appointment. Most suitable delivery time would be just after <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> presents government policy
                            statement to Parliament.</p>
                        <p>2. We have been encouraged by Thai return to constitutional government.
                            We have not, however, sent formal official congratulatory messages
                            either at time of promulgation of constitution in June 1968 or following
                            February 10 national elections,<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">The Thai
                                national elections of February 10 resulted in a victory for the
                                government parties, albeit a limited one. The Saha Pracha Thai
                                    (<gloss target="#t_SPT1">SPT</gloss>) party of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> elected 75 deputies to the
                                219-member Lower House. Independent candidates, over half of whom
                                were financially supported by Deputy Prime Minister Praphat, won 72
                                seats. The opposition Democrats won 57 seats, with the remaining 15
                                going to various minor groups. <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>
                                Intelligence Note No. 114, February 20, reported that the election
                                “enhanced” Praphat's position and was likely to result in “a
                                stronger behind-the-scenes role” for him. Forty-four Senators were
                                appointed later in the month in order to bring the Senate up to its
                                new constitutional size, and it remained securely under the control
                                of the government party. Note No. 114 reported that Praphat was
                                “unlikely to seriously threaten <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                    >Thanom</persName>'s position as Prime Minister” and was
                                “probably aware that he would be an unacceptable Prime Minister to
                                many Thais, from the King on down.” It added, however, that the
                                composition of the post-election cabinet would probably reflect his
                                wishes “that <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>'s
                                leadership position will be more circumscribed,” and that the
                                influence of civilian leaders, such as Minister for National
                                Development <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> Sarasin and
                                Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                                Khoman, could be decreased.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1"
                                    >POL</gloss> 14 THAI)</note> largely because such messages <pb
                                n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0060"/>could have been construed here as
                            paternalistic and elsewhere if known as indicative of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> influence behind Thai developments.
                            Assumption of office by PriMin is, in contrast, an appropriate occasion
                            to offer congratulations and to testify to our continuing cooperation
                            without incurring disadvantages noted above.</p>
                        <p>3. Moreover, while <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> leaders have to
                            date adjusted rather well to new political arena in which they are
                            operating, taking opposition attacks during electoral campaign and
                            failure to achieve absolute majority by balloting process more or less
                            in stride, strains will continue and may well increase when opposition
                            speaks out in elected House. Temptation to return to “good old days” and
                            avoid all this parliamentary unpleasantness will still lurk in some
                            leaders' minds. An expression of favorable <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> view toward Thai constitutional development, at time and
                            in manner that avoid any aura of interference in Thai internal affairs,
                            could help to encourage <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> leaders to
                            accept inconvenient aspects of constitutional government.</p>
                        <p>4. I suggest text along following lines: “Dear Mr. Prime Minister: I wish
                            to congratulate you on your appointment by His Majesty the King of
                            Thailand to serve once again as Prime Minister. Your formation of a new
                            government, following elections under the new constitution, marks an
                            important milestone in Thai political history and is a tribute to your
                            leadership. I look forward to a continuation of our close cooperation in
                            pursuit of peace and freedom.”<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">See <ref

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>On March 7 the King designated Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom Kittikachorn</persName> as Prime Minister under the new Thai
                            Constitution. A message from you congratulating him on his reappointment
                            would be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>We believe it would be in our interest to use this message as an occasion
                            for reaffirming the U.S. security commitment to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>We have reliable intelligence that the Thai leaders are currently in a
                            mood of questioning and doubt with regard to the firmness of the U.S.
                            intentions in Southeast Asia. This has been heightened by the Communist
                            offensive in Viet-Nam (which the Thai view as a breach of the
                            “understandings” which led to the total bombing halt) and the U.S.
                            reaction to it. They are also apprehensive about the forthcoming Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee review of U.S. commitments. Many of these
                            concerns have been reflected in recent public statements by the Thai
                            Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>While initially reassured by your election, the Thai leaders are in some
                            doubt about the policies of the new Administration. They have made it
                            clear that they are hoping for a full discussion of where we expect to
                            go in the war in Viet-Nam and the Paris peace talks during the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TCC1"
                                >TCC</gloss> meetings. But it will be risky to leave them in doubt
                            regarding our basic intentions in the two and a half months until these
                            meetings.</p>
                        <p>Early in the last two Administrations the President sent a message
                            reaffirming in general terms the United States security commitment to
                                <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0062"/>Thailand, so there are
                            precedents for such a message. Conversely, the absence of a message
                            could be noted by Thai leaders and add to their concern in their present
                            mood.</p>

                        <p>2. “Dear Mr. Prime Minister: Congratulations and sincere good wishes on
                            your designation by His Majesty as Prime Minister. Under your continued
                            leadership, I am confident that Thailand will sustain the remarkable
                            rate of development it has experienced in past years, and will remain
                            firm in the defense of freedom.</p>
                        <p>I want to reaffirm to you, at the outset of this Administration, that the
                            United States will continue to support Thailand and its resistance to
                            Communist aggression and subversion. We fully intend to honor our <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> obligation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> will report to me
                            on his conversations with you and your colleagues when he returns from

                            Bangkok. This meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for you and
                            the Secretary to review in depth the various issues of mutual concern.
                            It will, as well, be a most welcome occasion for our two new governments
                            to reaffirm the close ties between our countries that are so essential
                            to the maintenance of freedom in East Asia.</p>

                            every day that went by was a loss of time because American casualties
                            continued to grow. He also relayed a message from the Prime Minister
                            that following the bombing halt the situation in Southeast Asia had
                            gotten worse. One way or another, we should find a way to resume bombing
                            in North Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> also
                            felt that we should be prepared to use South Viet-Nam ground forces to
                            cut the infiltration. They were both capable and had the will to do this

                        <p>You are quite right to raise questions about <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>'s role and motivations in his rather excessive
                            recourse recently to the press and public platforms. I have been
                            troubled for some time by the apparent inconsistency between his
                            deploring what he regards as serious waverings in American determination
                            and resolve with regard to contributing to the defense of the Free World
                            in Southeast Asia and his occasional insistence on a bilateral security
                            treaty, no doubt motivated by these concerns; and on the other hand, his
                            verbal approaches to Communist China and occasional expressions of
                            reservations about a continued American military presence here. In a way
                            I think we have to read this ambivalence as a product, at least in part,
                            of our own current ambivalence in which we are on the one hand stoutly
                            devoting great blood and treasure to the defense of Southeast Asia,
                            which even <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> cannot deny, but
                            at the same time exhibiting to the world (no doubt in exaggerated form)
                            a body politic, including much of the press, most of the youth, highly
                            influential congressmen, and a preponderance of the articulate
                            intellectual community, which condemns our involvement in Vietnam and
                            which is obviously apprehensive even about our present degree of
                            involvement in Thailand, which it tends to see as going the way of
                            Vietnam. The Thai, to oversimplify somewhat, have increasingly <pb
                                n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0065"/>based their national policy on
                            collective security since 1954, and many of their own initiatives, and
                            even more their agreement to actions of ours, including those on their
                            territory, have been based on the continued availability of a protective
                            cover from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in case of trouble. Now
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> and the Thai ask
                            themselves to what extent that cover is still available and relate that
                            question also to our readiness to see through the Vietnam process to the
                            point where South Vietnam is going to be at least tolerably able to
                            decide its own future without outside interference.</p>
                        <p>Most Thais don't take seriously the threat of massive Communist invasion
                            as a likelihood in present circumstances, although they would
                            undoubtedly argue that if there is an obvious American disengagement
                            from Southeast Asia, the deterrent to such an invasion will have been
                            largely removed and the possibility increased that the Chinese might
                            return to something like Korean War methods. The President's recent
                            message to the Prime Minister<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note> and the assurances
                            provided by <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName>,
                            together with what I presume Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> will be saying in May, will probably keep those
                            apprehensions in the background for most of the Thai leadership even
                            though <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> will probably not
                            desist from carping comments. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the
                            Thai don't want our direct military involvement in their insurgency,
                            although they certainly are counting on our continued contribution
                            through <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> to the support of their own counter-insurgency. There
                            is, unfortunately, an ambiguous middle area between an invasion and the
                            insurgency and I think it is here that our most difficult policy
                            problems lie. This brings us to the Laos problem above all, and I'll
                            save further discussion of it for the next section.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> has become increasingly
                            over the past ten years, and particularly since <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> has been Prime Minister, the
                            architect of Thai foreign policy. In fields such as the promotion of
                            regional activities, the position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and dealing with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            on matters such as the Paris negotiations, he has, in my opinion, an
                            almost completely free hand. He also has been one of the three or four
                            most influential decision-makers on such matters as sending forces to
                            South Vietnam and on relations with neighboring countries. However, I
                            think it is questionable whether <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> would have won out if, for example, he had
                            opposed the sending of the Queen's Cobras and Black Panthers to Vietnam,
                            or if he had insisted on strong initiatives to re-establish diplomatic
                            relations with Cambodia; the fundamental military leadership still
                            controls these matters in the last analysis. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> has been able to play the role that he has
                            because he has been basically in agreement with the military leadership
                            on these matters. Similarly, on the question of future <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military presence here, including in the
                            post-Vietnam period, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s
                            voice will probably not be <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0066"
                            />decisive since prime matters of national security will be involved and
                            the military leadership will make the final decisions.</p>
                        <p>In spite of this, however, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            is heavily depended upon by the military leadership and especially the
                            Prime Minister, and his familiarity with the American scene makes him
                            particularly important as an advisor about relations with us. Thus,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> could be very
                            influential in convincing the leadership that a collective security
                            policy based on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> participation was no
                            longer realistic for Thailand. If he should undertake this (and I do <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> believe he is presently doing so) and be
                            successful, then the military leadership would have a much more negative
                            attitude about Thai participation in Vietnam and the future <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military presence in Thailand than they
                            have today. At the present time I believe <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>'s role with the military leadership is to raise
                            some warning signals about the future American role and to stimulate
                            some thinking about contingent actions in case the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should in fact disengage from Southeast
                            Asia. The military leadership consists largely of simplistic thinkers in
                            the foreign policy and military strategy fields; the subtleties of
                            regional security organizations and Paris negotiations do not interest
                            or concern them very much.</p>
                        <p>There are others on the Thai scene who play some role in the foreign
                            affairs field, notably <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>
                            Sarasin who undoubtedly does advise the Prime Minister in a somewhat
                            conservative and definitely pro-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> vein.
                            While <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> has on occasion made
                            some dubious comment about some of <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>'s more unbridled statements, he has shown no
                            disposition to challenge <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s
                            leading role in the foreign affairs field. A possible future figure of
                            importance is Bunchana Atthakorn and in this regard I call your
                            attention to the enclosed press article on a recent speech of his. As
                            time goes on, there possibly will also be new members of the military
                            leadership who will have some more sophistication about foreign policy
                            and military strategy, including emerging leaders like General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>. Today, however, the field is
                            left very largely to the Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                                >Praphat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> for the basic
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>Another factor of increasing importance in <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>'s thinking, I believe, is his growing concern as
                            a somewhat over-sensitive Thai nationalist about the impact of the
                            presence here of 50,000 American military. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>, and most other Thais for that matter, are enough
                            aware of what South Vietnam looks like today from the inside to know
                            that they do not want American ground forces participating in fighting
                            in Thailand. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, and even more
                            some members of the new Parliament and younger, semi-intellectual Thais,
                            are increasingly disturbed about what happens to Thai communities under
                            heavy GI influence and they are also vaguely uneasy about the effect on
                            Thailand's freedom of decision in an increasingly tricky and uncertain
                            period. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> is also
                            over-sensitive at the twitting he no doubt gets occasionally from his
                            colleagues in neighboring countries (although I would guess this <pb
                                n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0067"/>is less true than in the past)
                            and in international forums such as the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> about Thailand's having become so closely tied to the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. None of these things, in my
                            opinion, will lead <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> to begin
                            to press for the pullout of American forces here, or even a substantial
                            reduction, as long as the Vietnam war requires their presence. He does
                            not like to have it assumed, however, that once that is past Thailand
                            can be taken for granted as a home for indefinite <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> deployments in the future. You have noted, I am sure,
                            however, that <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> has carefully
                            left a loophole in all of his statements about <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> withdrawal from Thailand which makes it clear that the
                            Thais might find that there were compelling reasons why some <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces should remain here. I believe that
                            in the absence of a virtually utopian settlement of Southeast Asia's
                            security problems, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> will in
                            fact, along with the military leadership, wish to have some continued
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> presence unless we seem to have
                            gone the total disengagement route.</p>
                        <p>You are undoubtedly right in suspecting, too, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> is in part addressing the
                            American public. He bitterly resents the references which occasionally
                            (and a good deal less frequently than he alleges) appear in the American
                            press about Thailand's sending “mercenaries” to Vietnam and about
                            Thailand's being a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> puppet and one of
                            “our boys”, ready slavishly to do the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            bidding as long as we continue to throw a few bones its way. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> is also acutely conscious of the
                            “Thailand: the next Vietnam” theme. For all of these reasons he is
                            intent on conveying to the American public the sense of an independent
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> posture, even some reservations
                            about or hostility to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, and
                            removing the black and white image of Thailand as a single-minded,
                            anti-Communist <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ally. In my mind this
                            is surely one of his reasons for making such repeated loud noises about
                            a willingness to talk with Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>, not unjustifiably in my opinion, has identified
                            the peculiar American syndrome of denigrating and scorning its close and
                            loyal allies and being attracted to those who kick us in the teeth from
                            time to time; I think he is carrying out what is largely a one-man
                            campaign to move Thailand toward the second category.</p>
                        <p>Finally, a last little intriguing twist. You will see from Bangkok's
                                4299<note n="5" xml:id="d9fn5">Not found.</note> that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> probably is going to make a bid
                            for the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> seat in 1970. Could it be
                            that he has been working on his image and trying to be sure that he is
                            regarded as an international statesman of broad views and not tied to
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> kite, so that he does not lose the
                            votes on which he must depend for election?</p>
                        <p>This first answer has gone on for so long that I will send it off by
                            itself and proceed to the questions of post-Vietnam planning and Vietnam
                            and Paris prospects as soon as I can turn to them.</p>

                            should be assumed.</p>
                        <p>The study will:</p>
                        <p>1. Analyze U.S. interests and objectives in Thailand and their
                            implications for future U.S.-Thai relations, giving due consideration to
                            the historical background as it relates to Thai interests and U.S.-Thai
                            relations.</p>

                        <p>3. Analyze the program and budget implications of the key policy
                            options.</p>

                        <p>1. Military assistance and its role in the development of Thai security
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs and their role in

                            post-Vietnam war contingencies in Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>-based and Theatre-based U.S.

                            program effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>6. The programs of the U.S. Information Agency, the Peace Corps, and the
                            Central Intelligence Agency in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>Field research activities to obtain information needed for the analysis
                            shall be undertaken as required.</p>
                        <p>The study will be performed by an Ad Hoc group chaired by the <gloss

                            Director for Thailand will be the Vice Chairman of the Ad Hoc group. The
                            Chairman will consult periodically with the East Asia Interdepartmental
                            Group. The Ad Hoc group will comprise members from the addressee
                            agencies who shall be selected after consultation with the agencies and
                            designated by the undersigned in a separate memorandum.</p>
                        <p>To assist the Ad Hoc group in its study, the Secretary of Defense should
                            provide an analysis of possible Southeast Asia contingencies, including
                            the defense of Thailand, and their implications for required U.S. forces
                            and bases. This analysis will incorporate the results of analyses of the
                            effectiveness of past operations conducted from Thailand and reflect
                            agency views on the major outstanding issues. This study will be
                            forwarded to the Assistant to the President for National Security
                            Affairs by July 1, 1969.</p>

                        <p>2. After pleasantries, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> expressed our deep interest in Thailand and our
                            intention to continue to cooperate and assist in any way we could. The
                            Prime Minister said that the main thing Thailand needs today is military
                            equipment to assist it in coping with the infiltrated Communist
                            subversion. He mentioned specifically transport equipment, helicopters,
                            signal equipment and hand-held radar. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> to comment on this point. The
                            Ambassador explained that we are in regular touch with the Thai with
                            respect to military equipment programs in various fields. With respect
                            to transport, helicopters and signal equipment, we have fully
                            coordinated continuing programs, primarily in <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>. Much equipment has been delivered and more is
                            programmed. With respect to the hand radar, this is a subject on which
                            we require further knowledge of Thai requirements.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> asked if the
                            most serious subversion is in the North. The Prime Minister replied that
                            there are infiltration and subversion threats in both North and
                            Northeast. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal Dawee</persName>
                            interceded at this point to explain that there is serious infiltration
                            in both areas and this is why the hand radar equipment is needed as well
                            as helicopters with miniguns. He also mentioned reports of infiltration
                            by enemy helicopter and pointed out that the Thai had disagreed with
                            their American friends who had contended that enemy infiltration by
                            helicopter was impossible and there were no authentic instances of craft
                            having been seen. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal Dawee</persName>
                            indicated that several confirmed sightings have in fact been made.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> invited the
                            Prime Minister to give the Secretary a fuller appraisal of the Communist
                            terrorist campaign, particularly in the North where the
                            counter-insurgency concept of the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            may not yet be entirely clear. The Prime Minister said that internally
                            there is no need for undue worry because subversion within Thailand can
                            be controlled. But the Thai Government is very deeply worried about the
                            external threat which comes from Laos. He said the Pathet Lao and North
                            Vietnamese are advancing in Laos. The Chinese Communists are building
                            roads to points close to Thai borders. The North Vietnamese and Pathet
                            Lao are developing concentrations at points near the Thai border for
                            purposes of infiltration. In this connection he mentioned particularly
                            Campassak Province in Southwestern Laos which lies west of the Mekong,
                            creating a special danger for Ubol Province. The Thai support the Lao
                            Government and want it to keep up the fight in Laos outside of Thailand,
                            but the Lao Government is very <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0071"
                            />weak. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> interjected that
                            recently General Quan visited Thailand saying “my pockets are empty.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said the Lao Govt is in
                            very severe financial difficulties and is unable to pay or care for its
                            soldiers. He feared this would create a dangerous sag in morale,
                            desertions, etc.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> inquired as to
                            the quality of Lao soldiers. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1"
                                >Sullivan</persName> replied that it depends on how well led they
                            are and where they are fighting. He said that shortly before leaving
                            Laos he had recommended provision of M–16s to the Lao Army and also
                            conversion of 2 AC–47s into gunships of the kind which have worked so
                            well on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in recent months. With respect to the
                            financial situation, he pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_RLG1"
                                >RLG</gloss> has always paid its own forces but we, with help from
                            some others, have put in considerable financial help to bolster the kip.
                            He thought that Japan could very well make a significant contribution to
                            this cause without infringing its “constitutional limitations”. He
                            suggested that <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> urge the Japanese to make
                            such a contribution. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said
                            he has talked with the Japanese in the past about making a greater
                            effort in this area and is not optimistic that they will do so.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> expressed his
                            satisfaction with the two meetings that have occurred this week, and
                            paid tribute to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> for his
                            role in them. After a courteous response, <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> expressed the Thai Govt's appreciation for
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' reaffirmation
                            of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitments in his opening speech

                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> thought the Secretary's
                            speech had an excellent effect on the whole meeting. Secretary <persName

                            the meeting. As for the 1962 communiqué, he said that he regards it
                            merely as a valid statement, not an interpretation, of the commitments
                            undertaken in the Manila Pact.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>May I draw your attention to a matter of prime concern with regard to
                            Thailand and our relations with that country.</p>
                        <p>As you well know Thailand and the United States are intimately associated
                            in many of the security arrangements related to the protection of
                            Southeast Asia, and the fighting in Viet-Nam in particular. It is
                            essential for this reason that mutual confidence be maintained between
                            us particularly at a time like the present when critical decisions and
                            actions are being taken with far-reaching consequence for Southeast
                            Asia's future.</p>
                        <p>Now that the first step has been publicly taken with regard to the
                            replacement of U.S. forces by South Vietnamese forces in South Viet-Nam
                            and the initial need for absolute secrecy no longer applies so strongly,
                            I deem it essential that we open a dialogue on this subject with the
                            Royal Thai Government which has always held in strictest confidence the
                            many highly sensitive matters we have discussed in the past. We have
                            already reviewed with the Thai the considerations regarding withdrawal
                            raised in your May 14 speech.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">In his May 14
                                address to the nation, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                                proposed the withdrawal of all non-South Vietnamese forces from
                                South Vietnam, thus initiating the process of U.S. troop withdrawals
                                from that country. The overall idea implied in this address, and in
                                subsequent remarks from Midway Island, June 8–10, was that Asian
                                nations should determine their own destinies. (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                                </hi>, 1969, pp. 369–375)</note> At an early date we would like to
                            resume these discussions along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. As indicated by the Midway announcement it is the judgment of the U.S.
                            and South Vietnamese Governments that the expansion and strengthening of
                            the forces of South Viet-Nam have reached a stage which makes it
                            possible to begin the withdrawal from Southeast Asia of some of the U.S.
                            forces there. The U.S. Government would like to discuss this process
                            with the Royal Thai Government in general, as it relates to our further
                            actions on the ground and in negotiations toward a satisfactory solution
                            of the Viet-Nam problem, and in particular as it relates to the U.S. air
                            and army support forces presently stationed in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>2. We would also like to solicit the views of the Royal Thai government
                            concerning the continuing role of the division of the Thai Army now
                            fighting in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0073"/>
                        <p>3. These matters also suggest the desirability of our looking ahead to
                            the situation following a Viet-Nam settlement and beginning to consider,
                            in that context, such matters as the future of the Royal Thai Air Force
                            bases now very heavily utilized by the U.S. Air Force, of the air
                            defense radar and communications system, and of the U.S. logistic system
                            based on Sattahip and Korat.</p>
                        <p>I am persuaded, Mr. President, that unless we undertake to consult with
                            the Thai Government on their forces presently deployed to Viet-Nam they
                            may reach a decision unilaterally to begin the withdrawal of these
                            forces. Since this would detract from the multinational force fighting
                            there now and providing an important political symbol, I believe our
                            consultations should begin promptly to avoid this.</p>
                        <p>A source of continuing preoccupation in Thai-American relations is our
                            massive presence there today, made up primarily of U.S. air forces
                            engaged in the defense of Viet-Nam and, to a lesser extent, Laos. For
                            this reason and also for sound budgetary reasons, I am seeking by every
                            means to reduce the number of official Americans in Thailand whenever
                            this can be done without a loss in our effectiveness. In particular, I
                            believe we should plan to begin a modest withdrawal of such of our Air
                            Force units as may no longer be essential to the fighting in Viet-Nam
                            and are not needed for air support in Laos. However, I would strongly
                            recommend against any move of this sort or any indication of our
                            intention to take such action until after we have carried out with the
                            Royal Thai Government the kind of consultation outlined above which will
                            give the Thai the full context of any actions we plan to undertake.
                            Without such consultation the Thai may misread a withdrawal as premature
                            and signalling a weakening in our resolve to see the struggle through in
                            Viet-Nam to an acceptable resolution.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, we will be formulating an authorization for Embassy
                            Bangkok to undertake these consultations with the Royal Thai Government
                            as a matter of urgency in accordance with instructions to be provided
                            from Washington.</p>

                            courtesy call on you at 11:15 a.m., Friday, June 20.<note n="2"

                                found.</note> He is currently on home leave from his post in Bangkok

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> has three major
                            points to raise with you. They are:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency in north and northeast Thailand</hi>:
                            While the Thais have been fairly effective in dealing with insurgency in
                            the northeast, their effort in northern Thailand has been discouragingly
                            poor. There has been some consideration to a greater U.S. involvement,
                            but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> feels
                            strongly that U.S. forces should not become involved in
                            counterinsurgency operations. If the Thai cannot do the job, it will not
                            be done, and excessive U.S. involvement tends to weaken the Thai sense
                            of responsibility. Preferably, we should continue to advise and assist
                            the Thais, but let them conduct counterinsurgency operations.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The U.S. presence in Thailand</hi>: Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> is concerned over the
                            need both to reduce the U.S. presence in Thailand and make it as little
                            visible as possible. He would particularly like to see some military
                            units, no longer essential to the Vietnam war effort, withdrawn at an
                            early date. At your direction, we have asked the Under Secretaries
                            Committee to study this question and come up with recommendations to
                            you.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Fuller consultations with Thailand</hi>: Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> suggests there is a
                            need for fuller consultations with the inner circle of the Thai
                            Government on both withdrawals from Vietnam and U.S. military
                            deployments in Thailand after the Vietnam conflict. He believes this can
                            be done with minimal risk of public leakage. He will be bringing a
                            letter to you on this subject, a copy of which is attached at Tab

                            in both efforts to avoid direct U.S. involvement in counterinsurgency

                            becoming enmeshed in the process of clearing specific troop replacements
                            with the Thais.</p>

                        <p>Suggested Statement</p>
                        <p>3. “Our commitments involving the defense of Thailand are defined by the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty of 1954. These were
                            restated in the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> Communiqué of 1962. There is no
                            defense commitment to Thailand going beyond that Treaty. We believe
                            Senator Fulbright refers to contingency military planning. For more than
                            a decade we have participated in formulating contingency military plans
                            involving the defense of Thailand. This planning involves no further
                            commitment.”</p>

                                Fulbright contended that the Thais might believe that the United
                                States had committed itself to take specific action involving
                                substantial use of American troops through the Taksin contingency
                                plan, known also as Project 22 or by its <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                    >DOD</gloss> acronym, COMUSTAF 1/64. The Department of State had
                                tried to assure the Senator that both it and the Thai Government
                                agreed that military contingency plans did not affect commitments
                                and were only operational details to be used if, as, and when agreed
                                upon. Furthermore, Fulbright insisted upon seeing a copy of the
                                plan, rather than having a briefing on it, as the Department of
                                Defense proposed. On July 29, Fulbright renewed his request to the

                                Fulbright stated unequivocably on the Senate floor that the
                                Department of Defense offer of a briefing in lieu of the text of the
                                plan was not acceptable. (Ibid., pp. S9503–S9505) On August 19

                                the contingency plans and that “they should be looked at only at the
                                Pentagon.” Also the Senate Committee could only see the Thai plan
                                “and no others are to be shown.” (Notes of a telephone conversation,

                            the other party to believe that U.S. has firm commitment—already made in

                        <p>1. Reftel arrived just as I was departing with Secretary to the Cabinet
                            John Whitaker to call on Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>. During our review <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29"
                                facs="0078"/>with <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> of
                            President's forthcoming visit to Thailand, I found an occasion to refer
                            to <hi rend="italic">Bangkok Post</hi> publicity regarding Fulbright
                            charges. I reviewed the subject with <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> on the basis of paras 1 and 2 reftel. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> seemed perplexed concerning the
                            charge that there is a top secret agreement which commits the U.S.
                            beyond the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty. When I
                            mentioned Project Taksin, he seemed nonplused but his secretary,
                            Birabhongse, confirmed to him that Taksin is a military contingency
                            plan. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that all military contingency planning is within the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> context, but Birabhongse informed
                            him that Taksin is purely bilateral. In any case, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> fully understands that military
                            contingency plans do not affect commitments and are only operational
                            details to be used if, as and when it is agreed to do so.</p>
                        <p>2. I read to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> the suggested
                            statement in para 3 reftel and he commented “that seems very good.” As
                            for himself, he said that if he is questioned publicly, he will simply
                            say that he has no knowledge of any additional Thai-U.S. defense
                            agreement beyond <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Based on our
                            own judgment, as well as this interview with <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>, we concur with the suggested statement.</p>
                        <p>3. We will forward additional comments re reply to Senator Fulbright. We
                            believe the question of historical context is very important
                            particularly since we will be talking in those terms to Pincus and Paul
                            who will undoubtedly report to the Senator. We reiterate our desire to
                            see proposed reply before it goes forward.</p>
                        <p>4. On incidental interest, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            remarked that Fulbright's charges appear to be similar to some of the
                            things written in <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> and he
                            speculated on the possibility of some kind of “cabal” between Fulbright
                            and The Washington Post. This quite inevitably led him into a pithy
                            review of his feelings about Stanley Karnow,<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">

                        <p>The Thai regard the Viet-Nam war as part of the defense of Southeast
                            Asia. Therefore, the Paris talks, the status of Laos in a Viet-Nam
                            settlement, the stability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                            improvement of the South Vietnamese fighting effectiveness, withdrawal
                            of U.S. forces, the post-Viet-Nam U.S. force structure in Southeast
                            Asia, all are matters in which the Thai are vitally interested and wish
                            to feel involved in decisions on them. It is highly desirable that the
                            U.S. initiate a dialogue with the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> on
                            these matters as soon as U.S. thinking reaches a point at which it can
                            be shared.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Paris Talks</p>
                        <p>The Thai are very interested and concerned about the Paris talks. They
                            will be alert to any indication that they are not being kept as fully
                            briefed as other <gloss target="#t_TCC1">TCC</gloss>'s, particularly
                            since their record of maintaining security in sensitive matters is
                            excellent. Thailand is less fully informed about the Paris talks than
                            certain other TCC's (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, Australia,
                                <gloss target="#t_NZ1">NZ</gloss>) and less regularly briefed than
                            Korea and the Philippines; only Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> is kept informed, and he has been
                            only partially briefed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Their special interest vis-à-vis Paris will be the inclusion of Laos in
                            any settlement. (See background paper on importance of Laos to Thai
                                security.)<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note>
                            The Thai may also feel lingering anxiety about the possibility of
                            unreciprocated U.S. withdrawal and its adverse effect on Asian security,
                            and doubts about the viability of any government in South Viet-Nam that
                            would include Communists. They understand that now is not the time to
                            include <gloss target="#t_TCC1">TCC</gloss>'s in the talks but they
                            (like the other four participants) expect that the time will come.</p>

                            American determination for an equitable and honorable settlement, and
                            have told them that there will be further review in August of troop

                        <p>Thailand recognizes the intimate relationship of its security with that
                            of Viet-Nam and Laos, and the dangers which would attend Communist
                            successes among its Southeast Asian neighbors. Consequently, although
                            indigenous Communist insurgency threatens many regions of the country,
                            the Royal Thai Government (<gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>) has sent
                            approximately 11,500 men to South Viet-Nam, including an army light
                            division, small naval units, and an air force transport contingent.</p>
                        <p>When queried about the status of these Thai forces in Viet-Nam following
                            the Midway Conference developments, Prime Minister <persName

                            that Thai forces would be neither increased nor withdrawn at this time,
                            that the subject of their withdrawal was being studied, and that when
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> strength was sufficient, Thai
                            forces would be gradually withdrawn.</p>

                            views concerning the future of the Thai division in Viet-Nam. There are
                            a number of factors which need to be considered: (a) the need for Thai
                            forces in their own country to counter insurgency and provide a credible

                        <p>Good behavior by U.S. servicemen and energetic efforts by the Embassy and
                            military commanders have kept the incident rate low, but sheer numbers,
                            language, and cultural and income differences have led to inevitable
                            incidents affecting the Thai community. And as the atmosphere in Bangkok
                            has become increasingly political with the advent of elections and a
                            national assembly, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has become
                            increasingly sensitive to these incidents.</p>
                        <p>The large U.S. military presence in Thailand—primarily U.S. air forces
                            engaged in the defense of Viet-Nam and Laos—now totals about 48,000,
                            including 35,000 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel; 11,000
                            Army personnel <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0081"/>involved in

                                >JUSMAG</gloss> involved in training Thai forces. We have built
                            about $400 million worth of military facilities, including major

                            port-airbase complex at Sattahip/U Tapao, and improvements in roads,

                        <p>In April 1968 Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>
                            asked that “American Air Force personnel now stationed at Thai bases
                            remain in country, even though in reduced numbers, following U.S.
                            withdrawal from Viet-Nam and thereafter be taken out only gradually.”
                            During his visit to Washington in May 1968 we agreed to consult on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> has several

                                >New York Times</hi>, February 14, 1969; Foreign Ministry statement
                            of February 20, 1969) that U.S. forces are in Thailand in connection
                            with the war in Viet-Nam and will leave afterwards unless there is some
                            compelling reason for them to stay. In that event, a new agreement would
                            have to be drawn up between the two governments. On February 21, 1969,
                            the Department's spokesman affirmed that “the bulk of U.S. forces are in
                            Thailand in connection with the war in Viet-Nam … that obviously large
                            numbers of U.S. forces would not continue to be stationed in Thailand
                            after a satisfactory settlement in Southeast Asia unless there were some
                            compelling reason for them to stay. It is also quite clear that U.S.
                            forces would remain only with the agreement of the two governments.”</p>

                        <p>With a prospering economy and remarkable social and political
                            stability—in spite of military coups which have been bloodless and <pb
                                n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0082"/>largely of the “palace”
                            variety—Thailand's problems are largely externally instigated, and as
                            yet barely felt by the population as a whole. The insurgency is small,
                            affecting the lives of relatively few and remote rural villagers. Thai
                            leaders are concerned because they realize its Communist Chinese
                            instigation and potential seriousness. Progress in government, by
                            Western standards, is being demanded by Thailand's educated elite, while
                            the mass of Thai people still complacently accept Thai government in
                            traditional terms, demanding little from the government. The leading
                            opposition party is royalist, conservative, and urban, while the
                            pro-government party was strongest in rural areas.</p>
                        <p>Thailand is approaching a cross roads in basic policy directions as Thai
                            leaders anticipate an end to the Viet-Nam war and try to plot their
                            post-Viet-Nam course. Since World War II Thailand has been increasingly
                            committed to a pro-U.S. policy in reaction to the Chinese Communist
                            threat. During the last five years—with our heavy involvement in
                            Viet-Nam—Thailand's commitment to this policy has been almost total.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> has been
                            one of the most outspoken of Asian champions of resistance to Communist
                            aggression in South Viet-Nam. Now, with demands for peace and withdrawal
                            being publicized in the United States, the Thai are beginning to wonder
                            whether they have stuck their necks out too far by sending forces to
                            South Viet-Nam and allowing our use of Thai air bases to bomb North
                            Viet-Nam. Though still maintaining a pro-U.S. stance they are seeking to
                            widen their policy options by strengthening regional ties and increasing
                            contacts with other nations, such as the Communist countries of Eastern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>Thai leaders have been basically reassured by your letters to Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> and by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' statement at the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Council meeting last May.
                            However, contrary press reports and agitation in this country continue
                            to disquiet them, making continuing reassurance necessary. Your visit,
                            and re-affirmation of U.S. firmness in seeking a genuine peace in
                            Viet-Nam without sacrificing the freedom of our allies, will help to
                            maintain Thai confidence and stability.</p>
                        <p>The Thais have smarted under criticisms that their government is military
                            and un-democratic. Their new Constitution, adopted June 20, 1968, and
                            election of a House of Representatives on February 10, 1969, have
                            reflected both a desire to improve Thailand's image before the Free
                            World and genuine democratic aspirations on the part of Thailand's
                            educated people generally. By low-key notice of this political
                            liberalization your visit can encourage the Thais in these efforts.</p>
                        <p>We feel that by and large the Thai are meeting their present problems
                            effectively. They are improving their counterinsurgency efforts— though
                            encouragement to do still better in north Thailand is needed. They have
                            responded helpfully to the peace talks in Paris and to our <pb n="34"
                                xml:id="pg_34" facs="0083"/>efforts to de-escalate the fighting.
                            They have publicly maintained a posture of confidence in their pro-U.S.
                            policy, in spite of underlying anxieties. They are supporting regional
                            developments in the hope of someday building a foundation for a regional
                            security system. They have taken modest but significant steps toward
                            democratic rule. Your visit can dispel existing doubts on their part as
                            to the constancy of U.S. friendship and the feasibility of their
                            continued support to U.S. objectives as a means of ensuring their own
                            security.</p>

                        <p>The Thai are proud of their long record of independence, and are very

                            sensitivities. It is important therefore to emphasize the equal and

                        <p>It would also be helpful to use this visit to publicize Thai political

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that the communiqué of
                            the 9th Party Congress shows that Peking has reaffirmed its intention to
                            carry on war with its neighbors. Thailand will be under pressure. Many
                            countries in Southeast Asia are not strong enough to resist.</p>
                        <p>Thailand does not want ground forces—but not having an industrial base,
                            it does need assistance with matériel. It would need help with ground
                            forces in a general war. As long as it is an unconventional
                            revolutionary type war, however, the Thais want to depend on their own
                            ground forces. The Thai government wants to pursue a vast program of
                            civic action. The Thai government wants, (1) to work to create a viable
                            grouping of non-Communist nations, (2) to receive matériel assistance,
                            (3) to repel force with force—but with its own men, and (4) to continue
                            to pursue economic reforms to supplement other means of defense.</p>
                        <p>So far the Communist intruders have chosen remote spots where economic
                            development has not reached. They promise a paradise. The President
                            said, “like China.” <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            responded that in rural areas of Thailand, nothing is known of China.
                            The President said he wanted the Prime Minister to know his own
                            thinking. In case of overt aggression, we would expect to react. Where
                            major powers act, they must expect reaction from other major powers. If
                            the Communist Chinese were to try that, there will be a very strong
                            reaction from the U.S. But this is not likely.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said he fully agreed about
                            the unlikelihood of overt aggression. From the pattern we have been
                            seeing, we can expect that Peking and Hanoi will continue to rely on war
                            by proxy.</p>
                        <p>The President noted <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>'s
                            statement that the Thai wish to rely on their own manpower. There is a
                            difficult political problem in the U.S., he continued, but the U.S.
                            public <hi rend="italic">will</hi> endorse matériel support.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d18fn2">En route to the Far East on July 25, President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> held a press
                                backgrounder on Guam. The President believed that, following the
                                conclusion of the Vietnam war, there should be no U.S. withdrawal
                                from Asia: “the way to avoid becoming involved in another war in
                                Asia,” he said, “is for the United States to continue to play a
                                significant role.” But at the same time, he said, the United States
                                should avoid policies that would make countries in Asia so dependent
                                that it would be dragged into conflicts such as that in Vietnam.
                                Later, the President added that the United States was determined to
                                keep its treaty commitments, for example with Thailand under <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, but that it would encourage

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that in meeting
                            subversion, the Thais will meet force with force, using a combination of
                            military personnel, police and civic action. They are increasing
                            security measures for all areas, with a three-pronged program. Attention
                            will be given to getting produce to market.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that one can't deal with subversion by force
                            alone—the causes must be removed. But he doesn't agree with soft-heads
                            who think that you can solve every problem with another bowl of rice.
                            Thus he was glad that <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>
                            referred to his determination to use force.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wanted to ask a critical question, and asked that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> not spare our feelings.
                            He referred to our handling of Vietnam. How the war is ended will be
                            critical for peace and freedom in the Pacific. Is there concern that the
                            U.S. may move too fast in withdrawing its forces? Is there a feeling
                            that regardless of what he says publicly, we will let the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> go down the drain gracefully? He asked
                            for an honest answer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> smiled and said that since
                            the President asked him to be frank, he wanted to recall the views of
                            leaders of previous Administrations. If a decisive step had been taken,
                            the will of the enemy would now be broken. Because of the importance of
                            public opinion, one must take measures to meet its demands. He hoped the
                            other side would respond. If the other side does respond, the war can
                            end. But so far the other side has not responded. What does the U.S.
                            intend? If concessions are made by only one side, we have cause for
                            concern. He hoped the U.S. wouldn't go too far.</p>
                        <p>The President responded that nothing substantial has happened on their
                            side. If after a year the enemy refuses to talk, we can't <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0087"/>continue to talk in Paris and fight in
                            Vietnam with one hand tied behind our back. U.S. opinion won't tolerate
                            this. What did the Prime Minister think of that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that other government
                            leaders understand our motivation and our desire to meet public opinion.
                            In certain quarters in this part of the world and in Vietnam, there is
                            fear that the U.S. may appease the enemy too much.</p>
                        <p>The Thai government understands that the Vietnamese forces are to be
                            trained. Thus it is not overly worried by U.S. withdrawal. If the enemy
                            does not respond public opinion in the U.S. will recognize that the U.S.
                            has no other choice but to end the war satisfactorily. Thus, if after
                            the withdrawal of another 50,000 troops, there is no response, the U.S.
                            will have no choice but to take these measures.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to the views on Peking and Moscow in Indonesia,
                            noting that some people there think we have a condominium with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Others see too much
                            significance in the easing of restrictions with China. With respect to
                            Moscow, a condominium is out of the question. Moscow's objectives are
                            the same as Peking's but their tactics differ. With respect to China, we
                            took some tactical steps. But we play an even-handed game—depending on
                            how each country conducts its policy. There is no sign of a Chinese
                            change in this regard. Until this happens, no major alterations are
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> thanked the President for
                            this insight into U.S. policy. He expressed deep faith in the policy of
                            the U.S., which has never known defeat in its history and, he was sure,
                            had no intention to do so now. The Prime Minister hoped that some
                            measure of assurance could be extended to other countries which have
                            troops in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>'s
                            view on Laos. What should be done, other than our sending troops?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> passed on information he
                            said was provided by the Laotian government: The Lao capital is
                            encircled by enemy forces. Enemy forces are coming closer to Vientiane.
                            Laotians have asked for help from Thailand. The Prime Minister is
                            reluctant to do so—although willing to help Laos with volunteers. They
                            must get material assistance from outside. If the need is urgent, the
                            Laos government should talk to the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> is willing to send volunteers provided he gets
                            U.S. support.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to his previous point: the Thai contingent in
                            Vietnam is extremely helpful with U.S. public opinion. Though our
                            withdrawals will continue on a major basis as South Vietnamese troops
                            are trained, the President hopes the Thai troops will stay.</p>

                                >MP</gloss>'s who want to withdraw forces from Vietnam and reserve
                            them for combatting subversion here in Thailand. From <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0088"/>his standpoint the priority is clear:
                            Thai forces should join in the struggle against Communist aggression in
                            Vietnam. The presence of Thai forces there is justified. He will resist
                            pressures to withdraw.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's questions, <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> said there are 45,000–50,000 Americans in
                            Thailand. The majority conduct the air war in Vietnam and Laos. In
                            addition, there are engineer troops.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if it would cause concern if we reduced some support
                            forces related to bombing of North Vietnam, but not engineers working
                            with Thai support forces.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Concerning the
                                question of possible reductions in U.S. troop strength in Thailand,
                                the President said in his July 25 background briefing that this
                                would be discussed with the Thai in light of a general U.S. review
                                of military and civilian personnel abroad. (Ibid., p. 552)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said it was up to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if the troops are behaving themselves. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> replied there are very few
                            incidents. He would like to make a suggestion, he said, with respect to
                            B–52's. Laotians have indicated eagerness for their use. The Prime
                            Minister recalled having asked our headquarters for B–52 strikes: he
                            welcomes B–52's here. As for frictions, he has talked to the military
                            authorities regarding arrangements for a Status of Forces agreement
                            similar to Korea and Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what he believes the Chinese Communists will do after
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> replied that it depends on
                            the Vietnam settlement. If the settlement is satisfactory for the
                            Communists, China may have less opportunity for pressure. But whatever
                            the outcome, the countries of Southeast Asia will be subject to
                            pressure. There is roadbuilding toward Thailand from China and then from
                            Burma to Thailand. China has not given up the possibility of
                            interference. They are using proxies, influencing attitudes by means of
                            these roads.</p>
                        <p>The President noted the Chinese Communists have their own problems. The
                            Sino-Soviet disagreement may produce its own premises. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> replied that the Chinese are not
                            losing their own men— they are losing others.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that we must bring the war to an end in a way that
                            contains a message to China and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            discourage other aggression of this type. This should have been done
                            three years ago.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked if the Soviets have
                            shown any indication of helping. The President replied that they have on
                            procedural points— and in some oral comments. But he has been
                            disappointed. There is a chance the Soviets might find a way. Until
                            Vietnam is out of the <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0089"/>way, we
                            will not talk to them on other issues such as the Middle East, trade,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not more liberal, as was shown in
                            the case of Czechoslovakia. The President replied that we must avoid
                            armed conflict. Self-survival requires that. On the other hand, Soviet
                            policy is not soft. The Brezhnev doctrine completely discourages
                            independence. We are therefore approaching them in a hardheaded way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked how about Romania.
                            The President said he had visited Romania in 1967. He was invited by
                            Ceausescu shortly after the inauguration. His visit is not an affront to
                            Russia or a move toward China. What we are saying is that any country
                            not threatening its neighbors can have good relations with us. It would
                            be a mistake for the U.S. to recognize the Soviet doctrine of limited
                            sovereignty. Some believe we should have an immediate conference with
                            the Soviets and control of arms. We have not done so—not because the
                            President doesn't want these things, but because U.S. power is essential
                            to protect the free world. We will not tolerate Soviet superiority.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> turned to the Middle East
                            and asked about the balance of forces between Egypt and Israel. The
                            President said that Israel is stronger than its neighbors not because of
                            better equipment but because it is more capable, and will be for 3–5
                            years. The Soviets are continuing to send arms into Egypt and also for
                            other Arab forces. In the long run, the balance may change because the
                            Arabs have more people. Therefore we try to work for a peaceful solution
                            and to prevent a change in the balance. Until there is a settlement, no
                            change in the arms balance can be tolerated. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> drew a comparison between Israel and Thailand—a
                            small country can resist outside pressure only with outside help. The
                            President agreed this was a good analogy.</p>

                                during which he elaborated on <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                    >Rogers</persName>' theme that the present administration was
                                neither involved in nor responsible for formulation of the

                        <p>1. The events of the past several weeks have not only largely dissipated
                            the good will and the sense of congruent interests that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> engendered during his
                            short visit in Bangkok, but they have also placed Thai-U.S. relations
                            under the greatest strain since the Laotian crisis in 1961 and 1962.
                            Much of the difficulty involves Thai sensitivity to being treated as
                            something less than a full partner in the struggle for Southeast Asia,
                            and displeasure that its contribution to the Vietnam effort has not been
                            fully appreciated. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the current
                            unpleasantness as nothing more than a display of the ephemeral of the
                            Thai psychology. We are witnessing the surface manifestations of
                            underlying problems that have plagued U.S.-Thai relations since the 1961
                            Laotian crisis, and which have grown worse as a consequence of the
                            Vietnam war.</p>
                        <p>2. The principle cause of the current difficulties has been the public
                            dispute over Project 22, the so-called Taksin Military Contingency Plan
                            for the defense of the Mekong Valley. The Thai have been upset over the
                            way the U.S. has managed the controversy. Caught in a crossfire between
                            the U.S. Senate and the ill-conceived remarks of Thai leaders regarding
                            the juridical basis for the plan (Air Chief <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                                >Marshal Dawee</persName> asserting at one point that the plan was a
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> document and could not be
                            shown to anybody without the consent of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> partners), U.S. spokesmen have labored to set the
                            record straight.<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">See <ref target="#d14"
                                    >Documents 14</ref> and <ref target="#d15">15</ref>.</note> In
                            so doing, they have bruised Thai sensitivities. In a recent talk with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> made a special
                            point of protesting what the Thai regard as the unseemly alacrity with
                            which State Department spokesmen have challenged Thai statements on
                            Taksin. The Thai not only regard coordination on the Taksin affair as
                            insufficient, but they are also opposed to showing the plan to Senator
                            Fulbright (we would guess that this was the real message that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> was trying to get across), and
                            his Senate Foreign Relations colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Opposition on this score not only reflects Thai misconceptions of how the
                            U.S. constitutional system works, but much more important, reflects
                            their belief that Senator Fulbright is nothing less than a sworn enemy
                            of Thailand. (“Why is it”, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            has asked rhetorically, “that of all of the many military contingency
                            plans, Fulbright has picked on <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0092"
                            />this one.”) Turning the Taksin Plan over to the Senator then, is in
                            Thai eyes, tantamount to giving the plan to the enemy. The fact that
                            Senator Fulbright could pressure the Administration into showing him the
                            document was a vivid—to the Thai at least—display of power on the part
                            of those who are opposed to the U.S.-Thai alliance.</p>
                        <p>3. As upsetting as the Taksin imbroglio was up to this point, it still
                            involved little more than strengthening the Thai belief that they had
                            been once again misunderstood and pilloried for no other reason other
                            than that they have been a strong supporter of U.S. policy in Southeast
                            Asia. In order to get this monkey off their back, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> suggested to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> that the two countries publicly
                            announce that they would soon open talks on reducing the number of U.S.
                            military personnel based in Thailand. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> asserted that only in this way could Bangkok
                            demonstrate that U.S. forces were in Thailand for the sole purpose of
                            supporting the war in South Vietnam and that the Thai had no need nor
                            desire for direct U.S. support in fighting their insurgency. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> argued that this would undercut
                            the position of those elements in the U.S. who were warning against
                            additional commitments to Thailand. It also seems likely that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> had other purposes in getting
                            troop withdrawal talks. What better way to demonstrate to the U.S., the
                            contribution Thailand has made to the war effort, and at the same time,
                            that such support could not necessarily be taken for granted.</p>
                        <p>4. From the Thai point of view, the Taksin affair took a much more
                            ominous turn when Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> made reference to the lack of support in the plan
                            on the part of himself and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> lost no time in making it clear to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> that they regard the
                            Secretary of Defense's statement not only as a disavowal of a joint
                            contingency plan, but a reneging on a commitment that has been made by
                            the <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration. The Thai are clearly
                            looking for some assurance that this is not what Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> or the government had in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>5. Even if such reassurances are forthcoming, the Taksin affair will
                            probably leave a long-standing mark on U.S.-Thai relations.</p>
                        <p>6. How much Taksin effects U.S.-Thai interests will depend not only on
                            what assurances we give the Thai, but also on what action we take with
                            respect to Vietnam and, much more important, Laos. Vietnam is important
                            to the Thai insofar as it is a bellwether of U.S. policy in Southeast
                            Asia. Bangkok has been concerned over U.S. troop withdrawals, but once
                            we made clear that the withdrawals would be something a good deal less
                            than an indecent bug-out, Thai concern has centered on what they regard
                            as their prerogatives as a troop contributor to the Vietnam war effort.
                            They want the U.S. to truly consult with them before firm decisions are
                            made on withdrawals. In the present <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44"
                                facs="0093"/>atmosphere, such consultations are likely to loom even
                            larger in Thai thinking than they have in the past.</p>
                        <p>7. The question of Laos is much more difficult. For the Thai, Laos cuts a
                            good deal closer to the bone than Vietnam, and Bangkok will take a long
                            hard look at how the U.S. meets the current threat on the other side of
                            the Mekong. Whether this becomes a major testing ground in the coming
                            weeks and months depends, in the final analysis, on what the Communists
                            do. The Taksin affair and its aftermath, however, will serve to further
                            exaggerate the importance the Thai attach to the Laotian problem and the
                            willingness of the U.S. to stabilize the situation there.</p>

                        <p>The Agreement states that the Thai Air Defense/Tactical Air Control
                            System “has been integrated and incorporated into” the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Air Force's Pacific Air Defense Network.
                            It provides for the assignment of <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            personnel to units of the Thai system.</p>
                        <p>It provides that: “Hostile aircraft, including unidentified aircraft,
                            will be destroyed when determined by the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1"
                                >RTAF</gloss> Air Operations Center and/or the <gloss

                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> rules (of engagement) will apply for

                            aircraft.” The language does not distinguish between Thai and <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> “forces and installations” which will be
                            protected by this Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0095"/>
                        <p>The Agreement states, somewhat ambiguously, that: “The air defense of
                            Thailand is a sovereign responsibility of the Government of Thailand
                            which has been vested in the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>.
                            United States Forces deployed to, and at the request of, the Government
                            of Thailand, will assist in the Thailand Air Defense/Tactical Air
                            Control System”. It was perhaps this language which led Thai Air Chief
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal Dawee</persName> to state
                            publicly, shortly before the Agreement was formally signed, that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aircraft in Thailand could be called into
                            action by the Prime Minister to defend Thailand.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> transmitted this
                            Agreement to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs (at the latter's
                            request), with a Note stating that the “Agreement will improve
                            coordination between our respective air forces, in furtherance of our
                            common commitments to the defense of Thailand under the Southeast Asia
                            Defense Treaty.” The reference to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> was thus explicit, though the phrase concerning
                            “common commitments” was apparently new.</p>

                        <p>These <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> proposals raise
                            important questions regarding the role of the remaining U.S. forces in
                            Thailand. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> is proposing to
                            take out virtually all of those forces best suited for missions over
                            Laos (to assist the Laotian government and to bomb the Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail), leaving in Thailand the forces best suited to bomb North Vietnam
                            and clearly inferior for Laotian missions.</p>
                        <p>There are now 16 “fighter/attack” squadrons in Thailand. Twelve of these
                            are high-performance jet squadrons (8 with F–4s; 4 with F–105s). Four
                            are equipped with propeller-driven aircraft (3 with <gloss
                                target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss>s; one with A–26s).</p>
                        <p>Either <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> proposal would remove
                            all but one propeller squadron (which would remain primarily for search
                            and rescue operations). According to available evidence on the
                            comparative efficiency of these versus high performance jets, this would
                            be a very poor allocation of our resources in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>Comparison of the effectiveness of jet aircraft and propeller-driven
                            airplanes in attacking ground targets in Southeast Asia has shown that
                            the prop planes are considerably more efficient than the jets. A recent
                            study (August 1969) indicates that in Laos in 1968 propeller-driven
                            aircraft were roughly twice as effective as jets in terms of targets
                            destroyed per attack.</p>

                        <p>The primary combat advantage of the prop aircraft is their ability to
                            loiter, locate a target, and make multiple attacks on it. (Jets have a
                            comparative advantage against sophisticated defenses, but these are not
                            an important factor in Laos.) Prop aircraft also perform as well at
                            night as during the day,<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">It has been
                                suggested that the reason the effectiveness of prop aircraft does
                                not decline at night is that the enemy cannot make visual sightings
                                at night, there is more truck traffic at night, and the enemy's
                                visually targeted anti-aircraft weapons are less effective at night.
                                These factors permit the low flying, slower prop aircraft to operate
                                more effectively whereas the high-speed jet cannot operate at low
                                altitudes at night without greatly increased risks. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> while jets are only half as efficient after
                            dark. Most of the targets appear at night. One study has shown that the
                            cost of destroying a target at night with a jet is 13 times greater than
                            with a propeller aircraft. Finally, prop aircraft losses per target
                            destroyed are about the same or lower than for jets.</p>
                        <p>Considering this evidence, it is hard to fathom <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s rationale for their proposed
                            force cuts. An alternative proposal to take out three more jet squadrons
                            instead of the <gloss target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss>s and A–26s would
                            provide more manpower reductions, considerably larger budgetary savings,
                            and would have the least impact on the war effort. The disadvantage in
                            doing so is that if bombing of North Vietnam were resumed jets would be
                            preferable. Nevertheless, even an all jet redeployment would leave six
                            squadrons of high-performance jets in Thailand, and if we decide to bomb
                            North Vietnam again we can redeploy additional jet squadrons as
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>The proposal recommended by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            demonstrates again our inclination to attempt to suit the war to our
                            equipment and technological preferences rather than the other way
                            around. Our policies in this respect also serve to indicate to our
                            allies that high-performance jets are better counter-insurgency aircraft
                            than props, when in fact the reverse is true.</p>

                        <p>1. The following background information describes the role played by

                            over recent years. We have gone into this at some length because a full
                            understanding of this role is important in assessing the impact the
                            controversy over Project Taksin has had on the Thai and on their views
                            of basic trends in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Thai relations. We
                            also believe this background of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Thai
                            planning may be useful in preparing for further Congressional
                                scrutiny.<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">

                                in which he said that “Project Taksin itself originated as a
                                Democratic effort to convince the Thai that we meant business when

                            to observe the 1962 Geneva Accords and what appeared to be a growing
                            threat to Thailand developing through Laos. In July 1965 reacting to
                            this Thai concern, the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> called on
                            Prime Minister Sarit under instructions to say “we intend to do whatever

                                >US</gloss> in Southeast Asia. The United States will not sit idly

                            Thailand. The United States considers the Communist advance in Laos as a
                            threat to United States security as well as to that of Thailand. As we

                            from the President and that one would be forthcoming shortly. He added,
                            however, that there was no limit to what the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> would do if necessary to defend Thailand. The Prime
                            Minister said the Thai were undertaking defense measures and might be
                            compelled to cross the Mekong. He expected that if such steps were
                            necessary the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Thailand would act
                            together. The Secretary said he was encouraged by this Thai planning and
                            suggested the desirability of advance consultation. (Secto 27

                            be necessary against Communist advances in Laos. General Easterbrook,
                            Chief, <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> emphasized that this

                            Prime Minister but he was in a position only to transmit his views to

                                >Dawee</persName> said he understood how the United States

                        <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side pressed for Thai views on
                            just what Communist acts would be required to trigger joint Thai-<gloss

                            but indicated that the situation would have to be judged against
                            existing circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName>
                            also said that he assumed that this plan involving possible movement of

                        <p>8. In a letter to the Prime Minister from President

                            said “We regard Communist advances in Laos as a threat to the security
                            of the United States as well as to that of Thailand. In accordance with
                            this concept, I have authorized Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA3"
                                >Martin</persName> to open consultations with you looking toward
                            joint Thai-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military planning of

                            Bangkok this week. We must be prepared to act promptly and effectively
                            to check such a drive as necessary.” </p>
                        <p>9. On August 11, 1964, State concurred in the terms of reference (<gloss
                                target="#t_TOR1">TOR</gloss>) in a letter from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> to Solbert<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d23fn8">Not found.</note> which said “We see the possibility
                            of real political as well as military advantages arising from joint
                            planning with the Thai and we hope that it can begin soon.”</p>
                        <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_TOR1">TOR</gloss> called for planning to
                            provide for the defense of Thailand to include military operations to
                            hold the Mekong Valley, its principal cities, and its military
                            facilities (in Laos as well as Thailand). The threat is defined as
                            Communist operations in Laos as more than subversion but less than overt
                            aggression. The defense of Thailand could require any of a combination
                            of the following: definitive and punitive actions in the event of
                            Communist border incursion into Thailand; counterinsurgency actions
                            against Communist forces in Laos in the event of Communist border
                            incursion into Thailand; counter-insurgency actions against Communist
                            forces in Laos in the event of an insurgency in Thailand; and
                            interdiction operations against North Viet-Nam. The <gloss
                                target="#t_TOR1">TOR</gloss> also stated that joint Thai-<gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> consultations could be undertaken at any
                            time to determine what portions of the plan should be implemented.</p>
                        <p>11. On October 26, 1964, the basic draft force level plan was submitted
                            to the “national authorities” for approval. On August 23, 1965, <pb
                                n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0101"/>the final force level plan was
                            promulgated by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> at <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>. In
                            November of 1965 a draft field force plan was submitted to the national
                            authorities and on December 23, 1966 the final field force plan was
                            promulgated by <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> at <gloss
                                target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. At the signing of the field force plan by <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> and General Stilwell on December 23, 1966, Amb.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGA3">Martin</persName> noted he was
                            participating “on behalf of and as the personal representative of the
                            President of the United States.” He traced the plan's beginning at the
                            President's behest. He said the plan did not really deepen American
                            determination to do whatever is necessary to carry out American
                            commitments to insure the defense of Thailand and that “as the President
                            pointed out in his recent visit to Thailand that commitment is full and
                            complete and as the President reiterated then ‘America keeps its word.’”
                            Ambassador Martin said, however, “that the act witnessed today does
                            translate into effective operational terms the modalities of carrying
                            out our joint commitments should events dictate that our respective
                            governments would authorize the implementation of the plan. As such it
                            is of tremendous political importance in this translation into effective
                            operational planning for the use of our combined resources.” He then
                            coupled the plan with the recent approval of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> Plan 8 and concluded by saying that he had been
                            authorized by the President “to convey to your Excellency his personal
                            gratification and congratulations on the completion of this exercise.”

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>. The <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss> was under criticism from Praphas and <persName

                            Thailand's security needs and that America was “occupying” Thailand. To
                            help the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> fend this off the letter
                            linked these construction projects to existing agreements and to both

                            planning.</p>
                        <p>14. In June 1967, the draft air, naval and unconventional warfare
                            component plans of the project were approved in draft form and in
                            October of the same year the draft ground component plan was approved by
                            MACT.</p>
                        <p>15. In early 1968 a top secret working paper which gave a fairly clear
                            picture of the plan disappeared from the trunk of a car belonging to a
                            Thai member of the Project 22 working group. We do not know whether or
                            not the plan fell into unfriendly hands. Following this the name of the
                            exercise was changed from Project 22 to Project Taksin.</p>

                            Our role is limited to providing military equipment and economic
                            assistance where needed. The Thai understand this, and have publicly
                            said that they do not want US troops to assist them in dealing with
                            their insurgency.</p>
                        <p>—Demonstrating the Thai attitude toward the presence of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops in Thailand, the Thai Government
                            has encouraged us to reduce the level of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces in Thailand if not needed for Vietnam. It
                            understands that these troops are present in connection with the Vietnam
                            war, and can be withdrawn as their need diminishes.</p>
                        <p>—You consider that the Thai deserve a great deal of credit for their
                            staunchness as a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ally. Despite their
                            tradition of not becoming identified with any great power, they joined
                            with us as long ago as 1950 to help resist aggression in Korea, they
                            have cooperated with us fully in regional and world affairs, and they
                            have sent troops to fight in Vietnam in recognition of the issues
                            involved there. But they are a very sensitive Asian people, and feel
                            that somehow their contributions are overlooked or misunderstood. You
                            personally believe that it is important to reassure them on this
                            score.</p>
                        <p>—(<hi rend="italic">If asked</hi>) Concerning release of the Project
                            Taksin plan, you understand that arrangements have been worked out
                            whereby the document is available at the Department of Defense for

                            Government, inasmuch as Ambassador Unger provided the Thai with a

                        <p>1. This morning I secured appointment with Prime Minister before he
                            opened cabinet meeting and carried out instructions contained ref A. The
                            Prime Minister had with him General <persName corresp="#p_SSG2"
                                >Sawaeng</persName> and Deputy Foreign Minister Chitti acting in
                            place of <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. I first conveyed to Prime Minister text of announcement<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d26fn3">The final text of the President's announcement on
                                troop withdrawals from Vietnam was transmitted in telegram 156895 to
                                Paris, September 16. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27
                                VIET S)</note> as contained ref A, as amended by ref B.
                            Unfortunately, ref C arrived after I had departed from Embassy; to say
                            nothing of ref E. I explained that short advance notice unavoidable
                            because of inadvertent revelation from Saigon which Thais had all
                            already read in morning newspapers here. I also related this
                            announcement to our earlier discussions about troop replacement in
                            Vietnam (latest of which reported ref D).</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister's first question was to ask for more information on
                            reference to “offer of withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            and allied forces over 12 month period.” I pointed out that this and
                            other points made in same context all refer to efforts already made
                            which are here being reiterated and I recalled that some time ago we had
                            specifically offered to make such a withdrawal if accompanied by
                            responsive action by other side.</p>
                        <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0106"/>
                        <p>4. Prime Minister then pointed out that total projected <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> withdrawal by December 15 will amount to
                            more than ten percent of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces in
                            Vietnam. In view of this he considered it may be necessary to reduce
                            Thai contingent in Vietnam and said that he would be discussing this
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> when latter
                            makes anticipated visit to Thailand in latter part of October. Marshal
                            Thanom added that people here will feel that if <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> can make such a reduction, Thailand should also be able
                            to do so. I acknowledged this and fact that Prime Minister had discussed
                            this with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during
                            July visit, but I also received his confirmation that he was speaking
                            only of a reduction and not a total withdrawal of Thai forces from South
                            Vietnam. I emphasized the importance the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> attaches to the continued presence of other allied
                            forces in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. Marshal Thanom then inquired whether we will in fact go through with
                            the reduction of 40,500 additional men if there is no improvement in the
                            military situation. I said I believed we would since the reduction was
                            based, as far as I could tell, primarily on the enlarged capacity of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to carry the load, thus
                            permitting South Vietnamese to replace American manpower. I added that
                            our carrying through of the projected reduction might have to be
                            reconsidered, on the other hand, if the military situation should
                            seriously worsen.</p>
                        <p>6. The Prime Minister asked whether the projected reduction was based on
                            any indication of a greater willingness on the part of Hanoi to
                            negotiate. I replied that I was not aware of any improvement in that
                            quarter and reiterated my interpretation of Washington's action as being
                            based above all on the improved capacity of South Vietnam to carry
                            additional military responsibility. I added, however, that it may also
                            have been thought that the projected announcement could possibly provide
                            a helpful influence on the course of policy discussions which may now be
                            taking place in Hanoi following the death of Ho Chi Minh. Marshal Thanom
                            asked for any information I could give him about who may be assuming
                            leadership in Hanoi but I told him I had no useful information on this
                            subject beyond identifying the four well-known figures generally assumed
                            to be the leaders principally in charge there today.</p>
                        <p>7. The Prime Minister made no further inquiries about the announcement
                            but did go on to make some observation which he said he had also
                            discussed with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            during the July visit. Thanom said that here in Thailand and around the
                            world people have noticed a basic change in American actions. In World
                            Wars I and II there was determination to fight for the achievement of
                            military victory. This has now changed as illustrated by our actions in
                            Korea and Vietnam where the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> appears to
                            have lost this determination and is prepared to settle for something
                            less. I said that the important thing to keep in mind was the objective
                            which, both in Korea and South Vietnam, <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58"
                                facs="0107"/>has been to help a free nation to preserve its
                            independence; this was achieved in Korea where there is now a thriving
                            and prosperous Republic of Korea and, I was persuaded this would also be
                            achieved in Vietnam. The Prime Minister did not dispute this except to
                            say that in the Korean case we had expelled the Communists from South
                            Korea by military action which has not been done in South Vietnam. I
                            replied that while this was true today the situation at the present time
                            was vastly improved over that of 1965 when the collapse of South Vietnam
                            seemed a real danger and when American forces were introduced. Now the
                            Communists know they cannot win a military victory. I said again I was
                            persuaded that ultimately a settlement would be reached which would
                            preserve for the people of South Vietnam their independence and right to
                            decide their own fate. On Thanom's general point I added only that there
                            was a new element on the international scene since the days of World
                            Wars I and II, namely the reality of nuclear war and its dangers for all
                            of humanity; the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> must take this into
                            full account in its actions.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I would naturally have much preferred
                            to have given the Prime Minister more advance notice of the
                            announcement. Thai negative feelings on this score were, of course,
                            heightened by Ky's leak in Saigon. I also would have been in a better
                            position to discuss the announcement and Washington's thinking and
                            intentions intelligently if I had either been provided with some
                            background at this time or been kept currently informed as the talks in
                            Paris and the deliberations in Washington proceeded.</p>

                            commitments to Thailand, contingency planning, etc.</p>
                        <p>—Assured <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> U.S. will keep
                            commitments under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> to help defend

                        <p>—Advised that <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> should not be too
                            disturbed about unfavorable Senatorial and press statements but should

                            contingency plan, which is necessary and remains valid for

                            governments.</p>
                        <p>—Re U.S. troops in Thailand, President and Secretary noted false
                            impression created by critics to effect these troops there to protect
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>—Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s

                            told <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> we wished withdrawal
                            schedule to follow Thai wishes.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said <gloss

                            criticism but saw it as dangerous to both U.S. and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said his request for U.S.
                            troop withdrawal was tactic to reveal truth about purpose U.S. troops in
                            Thailand and relieve U.S. domestic pressures. Intent was not to drive
                            U.S. troops out.</p>
                        <p>—Responding President's question, <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> said he foresaw no immediate change in North

                            death and believed current U.S. policy correct.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> concurred in troop
                            withdrawals from Viet-Nam as politically necessary but noted importance
                            of preparing <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to take over.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said Prime Minister asked
                            him reaffirm assurance that RTG would not call on U.S. to help fight
                            insurgency, though it did want U.S. to maintain current level of aid to
                            support Thai counterinsurgency. —In response President's request,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> indicated <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> concerned over Laos and would keep U.S.

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Details</p>
                        <p>After introductory remarks, the President told <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> he was glad to have this private talk because he
                            had been disturbed over the effect <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0109"
                            />on Thailand of recent Senatorial and press statements concerning our
                            commitments to Thailand, contingency planning, etc. These statements, he
                            said, might cause some Thai to think the United States was going to
                            renege on its commitments and, worse still, seemed to reflect use of
                            Thailand as a “whipping boy” in U.S. domestic politics. Also, he said,
                            these were inconsistent with what he, the President, had told the Thai
                            personally. He wanted <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> to
                            know that because the Thai had stood with us in the past, the United
                            States would not let them down now. We will keep our treaty commitments.
                            He commented that the fate of Thailand was to a large extent what the
                            Vietnam war was all about.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that in the Senate and in other circles in the
                            United States there were many who wanted the United States to pull out
                            of all of its overseas commitments. For them, Thailand was merely a
                            convenient target even though most of them did not understand anything
                            about Thailand itself. The President then urged <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, whenever any public “flare-ups”
                            of this sort should occur in the United States, to check with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, with the Secretary or
                            with the President to determine the facts. If any real differences
                            should develop between us, he said, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> will not learn about them first from the press.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the controversy over the contingency plan, the President
                            commented that such planning was obviously necessary and added that we
                            would not disclose it to anyone who ought not to see it. The Secretary
                            then called attention to the fact that, before joint planning with
                            Thailand had come under Senatorial fire, there had been an earlier
                            controversy regarding military planning with Spain. This showed that
                            Thailand itself was not the objective of the critics. He added that
                            there had been some misunderstanding about the United States position on
                            the contingency plan and that, specifically, some remarks of Secretary
                            Laird's taken out of context had been misinterpreted. When Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> characterized the plan
                            as not having been approved, he meant simply that its implementation had
                            not been approved; implementation would not, of course, be considered
                            unless the appropriate contingency should arise.</p>
                        <p>The President then interjected to say that more important than any plan
                            is the United States commitment. He said again, with emphasis, that the
                            United States would help to resist external aggression against Thailand
                            and would support Thai efforts to counter internal insurgency and
                            subversion. He asked that this be conveyed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> (the President then commented to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> that the Prime
                            Minister and Foreign Minister had stood with the United States and were
                            friends “whom we did not like to see kicked around”). The Secretary said
                            there had been distorted statements in the press to the effect that
                            United States troops were in Thailand to protect Thailand and this was
                            false. He then referred to <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName>'s talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> on troop <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0110"
                            />withdrawal and said we wanted to follow Thai views on the timing
                            which, he understood, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> wanted to
                            be gradual. The President commented jokingly that, in light of
                            Senatorial attacks on our troop presence in Thailand, those troops could
                            stay as far as he was concerned “till hell freezes over.” He said the
                            Thai should let us know what they wanted in this regard and we would do
                            it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said he was grateful for
                            the President's assurances and would pass them to his Government. The
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> was not misled by the U.S. press
                            but was concerned that the publicity campaign and political controversy
                            were dangerous to both U.S. and Thai interests. He feared the U.S.
                            public was being deceived about the role of U.S. troops in Thailand and
                            the effect would be to drive a wedge between the United States and
                            Thailand. He said he had discussed the subject before a correspondents'
                            gathering in Thailand following conversations he had with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJJ1">Shakespeare</persName>, <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                >USIA</gloss> Director, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName>. As he had told them, his purpose in calling for
                            withdrawal of U.S. troops was not to drive them out but to bring the
                            truth to the attention of the U.S. public and the world. He added that
                            he thought that this tactic had succeeded. The President concurred. The
                            President said we understood the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            position regarding our troops and advised that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> could help in minimizing harm done by
                            unwarranted public criticism by keeping U.S. press and Congressional
                            comments in perspective. He assured him again that, if any real troubles
                            or differences should develop between us, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, the Secretary and the President
                            would be certain to discuss them.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s
                            views on the new situation in North Viet-Nam following <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi Minh</persName>'s death. He wondered if
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> anticipated that the
                            new leaders would be more intransigent or less or about the same.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said he expected that
                            North Viet-Nam's policy would continue about the same for some time. He
                            said the new leadership has not made up its mind yet and would require
                            time to determine any new course of action. In the meanwhile, its eyes
                            and ears would be directed at U.S. public opinion.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question as to what the United States
                            should be doing on Viet-Nam, the Foreign Minister answered that
                            currently the United States policy is in general accord with Thai views.
                            He said they realize that the United States must withdraw troops to ease
                            domestic pressures and he drew attention to the fact that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> had never objected to announced troop
                            withdrawals. He cautioned, however, that we must make sure that the
                            South Vietnamese are trained and equipped to take over the combat burden
                            as U.S. troops leave.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then said the Prime
                            Minister had asked him to reaffirm to the President that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> would not call upon the United States
                            to help fight its insurgency. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            only hopes the United States would <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0111"
                            />continue helping the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> in its own
                            efforts. He asked that there be no reduction in U.S. assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired about Thai concern over Laos and whether the Thai
                            were more or less optimistic now than they have been in the past. The
                            Foreign Minister said recent developments have been favorable though the
                            situation is of continuing concern. In response to a question from the
                            President about the strength of the North Vietnamese forces in Laos, the
                            Foreign Minister commented that they were not so powerful as they seemed
                            but were reckless with human lives. The President concluded by urging
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> to keep us closely
                            informed of Thai views of Lao developments.</p>

                                noting that, at his request, the Departments of State and Defense
                                had compromised their divergent views. Laird had wanted the troops

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> dinner previous
                            evening. In particular, anything new on Vietnam. Secretary replied he
                            had not raised matter since we had previously made clear our willingness
                            accept Russian initiatives to aid in settling Vietnam conflict. He said
                            we do not want to appear overeager or panicky, which we are not. As
                            result, neither Vietnam or China discussed. Secretary offered his
                            opinion that Russians not settled on many aspects of foreign policy and
                            these matters pretty much up in air. Only positive aspect was tone of
                            meeting. Sov proposals on European security conference cloudy, only
                            wished large conference to ease tension. ForMin and Secretary agreed
                            that there was equally little substance in Asian security proposal.
                            ForMin mentioned Sov overtures re Aeroflot service and Secretary
                            observed that they appear willing only supply good will but no help.</p>
                        <p>6. ForMin said he supported <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> gestures to
                            gain settlement but wished reaffirm need for <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> to maintain strong position. If such position <pb n="64"
                                xml:id="pg_64" facs="0113"/>held, he felt confident something would
                            develop. Secretary reiterated that it was firm intention President
                            maintain firm position on Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>7. ForMin asked if it would be possible for him to have more advanced
                            consultation on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop replacement.
                            Secretary replied we will of course consult and asked if he were
                            referring to B–52 36-hour pause or cessation B–52 action. He assured
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> that we had no
                            intention cease B–52 activities. Secretary then outlined our hope for
                            evenly paced troop withdrawal, discussed problem of leaks which reduce
                            President's flexibility, and undertook to give Thai more advanced
                            notice. He said we expect to consider this problem again in mid-Nov.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary asked if <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> considering
                            troop reduction in Vietnam. ForMin replied not without full consultation
                            with Vietnam allies and not unless reduction would not affect <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> war effort. In response to Secretary's
                            suggestion that Thai need troops for internal use, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> replied that <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> might possibly require them in
                            northeast.</p>
                        <p>9. ForMin then asked about effect of Cooper amendment. Secretary replied
                            it intended prevent use of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ground
                            forces in undeclared war and would not affect <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> commitments under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss>. In response to ForMin's question re Chinese
                            invasion, Secretary said that if Chinese attacked, <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> obligation would become operative.
                            Secretary went on to say concern was mainly over possible use <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ground forces in Laos. He said this was a
                            one-year amendment on an appropriation bill and he would get exact
                            wording and discuss with <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> in
                            Washington. ForMin asked if it were not similar to Tonkin Gulf
                            Resolution and Secretary replied negatively and repeated previous
                            explanation. Secretary promised to get exact amendment wording and give
                            a memo on subject to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>10. Tone of meeting very cordial and <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> appeared pleased with answers to points

                                that the provision of additional aircraft is a high priority action.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was strong on
                                the point that T–28s should not be taken from the Thais to be given

                                    >RLAF</gloss>. There followed a lengthy discussion of artillery
                                support. It was reported that Thai Prime Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> had recommended introducing a
                                Thai artillery unit equipped with 155s into Laos. It was noted that
                                at “the present time Thai volunteers are training the Meo in the use
                                of 155s. This gun is not particularly suited for operations in Laos.
                                Moving them about from mountain to mountain by helicopter is an
                                awkward task. Nevertheless, field recommendations favor introduction
                                of Thai 155s with a combat defense force of about 300 troops. <gloss

                        <p>1. Working out with our Embassies in Vientiane and Bangkok the
                            introduction of a small Thai fire-control element into Laos to assist
                            Meo <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0115"/>gun crews, phasing the Thai
                            out when Meo have been adequately trained to replace them. The
                            assumption is that immediate reintroduction of the full Thai artillery
                            battery which was withdrawn earlier (“<gloss target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1"
                                >Sierra Romeo</gloss> VIII”) might reveal the Thai presence and
                            leave Thailand vulnerable to charges of violating the 1962 Geneva
                            Accords.</p>
                        <p>2. Continue studying with Embassies Vientiane and Bangkok the possible
                            utilization of “<gloss target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1">Sierra Romeo</gloss>
                            VIII” elsewhere in Laos where it can be both effective and not readily
                            visible or vulnerable. Defense believes that this battery is a useful
                            asset; Ambassador Unger wants it to show the Thai that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests continue in maintaining a
                            military balance in Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. Consider via our Ambassadors in Bangkok and Vientiane giving
                            specialized and intensive training to Thai forces for possible future
                            operations against the North Vietnamese in Laos. Although the Thai
                            forces would not necessarily be committed, their extra capabilities
                            would be available in the event that their help becomes needed.</p>
                        <p>4. Once a North Vietnamese offensive begins and suitable targets are
                            identified, implementing B–52 reconnaissance to develop strike
                            information and possibly to give Hanoi a signal. This action would be
                            withheld for the present, however, to give us an opportunity to study
                            countermeasures for dealing with the risks involved and to provide for
                            necessary advanced planning.</p>
                        <p>5. If an enemy offensive assumes a size indicating an intention of going
                            beyond the previous pattern of attacks, giving commanders in the field
                            authority to increase manned tactical reconnaissance activities over
                            North Vietnam and the Lao border area below 19 degrees north and
                            initiate tactical reconnaissance in the border area above 19 degrees
                            north. Such activity would enhance intelligence collection capability,
                            provide target data for possible future actions, serve as a signal to
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that we might bomb portions of

                        <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> opened the conversation by
                            referring to our current concern about the Symington Subcommittee
                                hearings.<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">In an October 10 letter to

                                    corresp="#p_SWS2">Stuart Symington</persName> (D–Missouri)
                                announced that the third phase of hearings of the Subcommittee on
                                United States Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad of the
                                Senate Committee on Foreign Relations would take place the week of
                                November 10 and would focus on Thailand. He requested that <persName

                                for testimony in executive session. Symington noted that some of the
                                subjects with respect to Thailand would include treaties, joint
                                planning and exercises, U.S.-built military facilities and military
                                forces in Thailand, military assistance, external and internal
                                security threats to Thailand, U.S. electronic intelligence gathering
                                in Thailand, the Thai roles in the Laotian and Vietnamese wars, and
                                Thai companies controlled or run by Thai Government or military
                                officials. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59,

                                    >US</gloss>) Subsequently, in a lengthy telephone conversation
                                with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on November
                                17, <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> insisted that
                                “Unger should testify by himself,” rather than with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, who “throws a cloak of
                                secrecy” over the testimony. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> demurred, stating that his instructions
                                were that they testify together. (Library of Congress, Manuscript

                            informed the Ambassador confidentially that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> was returning to Washington
                            shortly to testify before the Subcommittee on Thailand. He assured
                            Sunthorn that we would do all we could to protect Thailand's interests
                            in connection with public release of testimony but outlined the problems
                            involved and warned that we could give no guarantee that the
                            Subcommittee would not eventually publish information that we and the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> would prefer to keep
                            confidential. The Ambassador expressed appreciation and urged that every
                            effort be made.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary noted that Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                                >Fulbright</persName> and the Symington Subcommittee were motivated
                            largely by fear that in Laos and <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0117"
                            />Thailand we might have undertaken commitments that could lead to
                            direct involvement as in Viet-Nam. The Ambassador commented that
                            Thailand was much better off than Viet-Nam in terms both of leadership
                            and national will and thus the situation was not likely to become as
                            serious as it had in Viet-Nam. The Under Secretary agreed and assured
                            him that this point would be made in the hearings and put in the public
                            record. He agreed with the Ambassador that it was in United States
                            interest for us to help the Thai maintain their security but that there
                            should be no need for United States troops. He told the Ambassador he
                            believed the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had nothing to
                            apologize for in either Thailand or Laos, and that both we and the Thai
                            should be proud of the story we had to tell about our relationship.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked the Ambassador what he saw as his most
                            important problems as Ambassador in Washington. Sunthorn immediately
                            responded that his most important concern was that the United States
                            Government maintain economic assistance at past levels. Past assistance
                            had been successful, he said, but Thailand's economic outlook was such
                            that continuation of substantial assistance was desirable. He pointed
                            out that the trade balance was adverse, primarily because of declining
                            rice exports, and noted that the World Bank had reported that this year
                            for the first time Thailand would suffer a balance of payments deficit.
                            The decline in exports is a major factor <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69"
                                facs="0118"/>and another is increasing domestic expenditures for
                            development purposes, especially the accelerated rural development
                            program (<gloss target="#t_ARD1">ARD</gloss>) which has been
                            sufficiently successful to justify increasing allocation of Thai
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked how U.S. economic assistance compared in
                            magnitude with U.S. military expenditures in Thailand. The Ambassador
                            could not give statistics but said military expenditures were
                            considerably larger. He added that, while U.S. assistance has been
                            substantial, U.S. exports to Thailand have also been increasing. In
                            response to a question by the Under Secretary the Ambassador indicated
                            there was also a growing trade deficit with Japan.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of Thailand's efforts to diversify its
                            agricultural production and exports through development of corn, millet,
                            tapioca, cassava, etc. The Ambassador said there was little expansion of
                            exports of manufactured goods, the development of manufacturing thus far
                            serving primarily for import substitution (with the exception of
                            cement).</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HS5">Sunthorn</persName> then reiterated
                            that the main problem was rice and commented that our Department of
                            Agriculture was familiar with <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            complaints about PL–480 sales in the area and exports of U.S. rice to
                            Hong Kong, an important traditional Thai market. The Under Secretary
                            said one of the problems affecting decisions on U.S. aid to Thailand was
                            Thailand's high level of foreign exchange reserves. Some argue that this
                            means Thailand does not need foreign assistance. On the other hand, one
                            could question whether the Thai should be “penalized” for the good
                            management which resulted in accumulation of reserves. In any case, the
                            high reserve level was a problem when we tried to justify aid to
                            Thailand on the Hill.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador explained that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> had
                            to maintain substantial reserves because it needs flexibility in the
                            event of contingencies such as drought, floods, etc. which might
                            suddenly reduce exports and require rapid drawdown of reserves. He added
                            that Thai reserves will probably be down this year about $30 million and
                            this trend is expected to continue for the next few years. This is one
                            reason the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> hopes U.S. economic
                            assistance will remain at a high level. Under Secretary
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> responded that it was nevertheless
                            desirable to look toward a termination of all foreign assistance to
                            Thailand as soon as possible, as had occurred with Taiwan. Thailand, he
                            said, is a “success story” and it is healthy for both sides in the
                            circumstances to anticipate an end to aid and to placing relations on an
                            equal footing. The Ambassador agreed but argued that timing is
                            important.</p>

                            gaps, particularly concerning the onset of negotiations with the Thai
                            about the possibility of their sending ground troops to <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. What follows should serve as a solid
                            basis for a prepared statement:</p>
                        <p>2. The Thai arrived at their present force level in <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in four stages. In 1964 they sent a
                            small air force contingent, in 1966 a naval unit, in 1967 an infantry
                            regiment and in 1968 they increased the regiment to a division. We began
                            supporting their effort in 1966. This support evolved through several
                            stages and for a time varied from unit to unit. There is consequently
                            some overlap in the following account of the various Thai
                            contributions.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here are paragraphs 3–10 describing details of the Thai military
                            involvement in Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>11. Thailand can notify the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at any
                            time that it wishes to withdraw some or all of its forces in <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. While our records do not contain
                            information specifically on the duration of the Thai commitment to
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> it is reasonable to assume that
                            neither we nor the Thai are under an obligation to continue support of
                            the Thai military contribution to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            indefinitely; therefore, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could
                            terminate its support of the Thai forces after, of course, notifying the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>. Also we feel certain that we
                            could persuade the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> to withdraw its
                            forces from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> if it were prudent to do
                            so. The Thai have indicated their desire to coordinate closely with the
                            other allies in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. We have not
                            suggested to the Thai that they reduce or withdraw their forces; however
                            both we and they are aware of the insurgent threat in Thailand and the
                            related threat of enemy advances in Laos. There has been some
                            speculation among individual <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            authorities that it might be necessary to withdraw or reduce their
                            forces if the threat to Thailand becomes worse. However, recently the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has publicly announced its
                            intention to continue its military contribution to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as long as each believes it is a
                            necessary contribution.</p>

                                agreed to equip and pay for the training of the Thai ground forces

                            Assistance Program. The <gloss target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss> program
                            was used to meet Thai requirements stemming from a deployment decision
                            in 1967. Amb <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>'s Nov 7,
                                1967<note n="5" xml:id="d32fn5">Not printed.</note> letter outlines
                            this. The Thai had two major concerns when they decided to increase its
                            infantry contribution to a division in late 1967.</p>
                        <p>A. They were concerned that sending their best troops out of country in
                            substantial numbers would weaken their military posture in Thailand.
                            They sought to meet this by accelerating their modernization efforts and
                            sought our assistance. In response we agreed to increase the MASF level
                            from $60 million to $75 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68
                            and to a $75 million planning figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 69. We also agreed to consult with the Thai on the
                            composition of the program.</p>
                        <p>B. With the decision to send a division, longstanding Thai anxieties
                            about air attack surfaced once again. They asked for a Hawk battalion
                            and after considerable discussion we settled on a Hawk battery to be
                            deployed after the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> had acquired the
                            necessary land and completed the requisite construction. We also agreed
                            to train the Thai to operate the battery and turn it over to them. The
                            cost of the battery, not to be borne by the <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> Program, is about $7 million. The annual O&amp;M cost
                            to the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Program is estimated to be
                            about $1.2 million. To date the site has not been prepared and the Hawks
                            have not been deployed.</p>
                        <p>13. The dispatch of forces to Vietnam has had a nearly uniform positive
                            political impact in Thailand. The Thai believe that their participation
                            in the conflect reflects credit on the nation, particularly because it
                            is a volunteer expeditionary force. The Thai believe that unit
                            performance has been creditable and they take pride in the recognition
                            given for specific actions by the allied command.</p>
                        <p>During the election campaign, nearly a year ago, a few voices were raised
                            by left-wing fringe candidates advocating withdrawal of Thai forces from
                            Vietnam (and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces from Thailand),
                            but as noted elsewhere these had no effects on the campaign or its
                            outcome. More recently, in the wake of the beginning of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop reduction program, some similar
                            comments have appeared. These have been divided among the handful who
                            advocate withdrawal in principle, and who are still regarded as aberrant
                            by most Thai, and a few who have <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0121"
                            />argued that Thai forces should be drawn down along with other allied
                            forces in the light of security requirements at home.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> and Viet-Nam Strategy</p>
                        <p>14. The Thai Government has participated as one of the troop contributing
                            countries in periodic meetings and in the process of consultation on
                            major political and military moves to which the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> Government is pledged. The more formal acts of
                            consultation have, of course, been accompanied by a continuing exchange
                            of information, ideas and views. 15. By these means, key Thai leaders
                            have been given a sense of participation commensurate with their
                            contributions to the joint effort— contributions which in their minds
                            include not only the dispatch of Thai forces to Vietnam, but the
                            provision of bases and facilities for use by <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces in Thailand. They have neither had nor sought a
                            direct role in development of strategic or tactical plans by <gloss
                                target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. But they have felt free to express
                            their judgments as to the general course of action best calculated to
                            bring the war to a satisfactory ending. They have consistently
                            advocated, and still prefer, that efforts at negotiation be accompanied
                            by application of sufficient military pressure to make the negotiations
                            meaningful and to protect the fundamental principles on which <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Republic of Vietnam participation in
                            the Paris Talks has been premised.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> and Viet-Nam Settlement</p>
                        <p>16. The Thai Government expects to have a voice in the eventual Vietnam
                            settlement and, indeed, desires to have a part in the post-hostilities
                            efforts to maintain stability and promote regional reconstruction and
                            development.</p>
                        <p>17. The Thai Government has accepted the propriety of the current phase
                            of the negotiations being conducted by the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and the Republic of Vietnam, speaking for all the troop
                            contributing countries. They expect to be kept informed of developments
                            in and related to the talks. This has been done on a very selective
                            basis, and there has been no indication that the Thai feel their
                            legitimate interests are being disregarded. They have however emphasized
                            their desire for more timely consultation in advance of actions. They
                            have made no requests to participate in the Paris Talks themselves at
                            this stage, but expect to participate in negotiations leading up to the
                            eventual settlement.</p>
                        <p>18. The claim of the Thai and other troop contributing govts to
                            participate in appropriate ways in the eventual settlement is recorded
                            in the Manila Communiqué of 1966.<note n="6" xml:id="d32fn6">For text of

                                dealt with the participation of troop-contributing countries in the

                                consultation among themselves in regard to settlement of the
                                conflict.”</note> The Thai understandably and <pb n="73"
                                xml:id="pg_73" facs="0122"/>properly take this seriously. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government has given expression to the
                            need for consultation as events unfold through meetings of the foreign
                            ministers of the troop contributing countries, which have been held in
                            conjunction with the annual meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> Council and, in Sept. 1969, at Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' initiative in New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of clearer indication of the time when negotiations will
                            become meaningful, and in what kind of forum, the Thai Govt has not
                            spelled out its ideas on the way in which it could appropriately
                            participate. In the meantime, however, as noted above, they have wished
                            to maintain a dialogue on the substance of the Vietnam problem. We
                            believe that the Thai do this with the other allies as well as with the
                            US and that the views of the Govt of Vietnam are given special weight in
                            the development of Thai positions. Throughout the period of the Paris
                            Talks, Thai leaders have spoken in opposition to the imposition of a
                            coalition govt on South Vietnam, taking in this respect at least as hard
                            a position as that of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>19. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> has
                            indicated in a general way the disposition of the Thai Govt to continue
                            to play an active role in Southeast Asian affairs following achievement
                            of a settlement. The Thai seem attracted to the idea of entrusting the
                            task of supervising provisions of the settlement to a largely Asian
                            group of nations, more broadly based than the International Control
                            Commissions established in the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements. If such
                            a step were feasible now, it seems likely that the Thai Govt would
                            itself be willing to contribute to such an effort.</p>
                        <p>20. The prospect of a coordinated attack on the problem of reconstruction
                            and continuing development in the Southeast Asian region has held great
                            appeal for the Thai ever since President <persName>Johnson</persName>'s
                            speech at Johns Hopkins in 1965. The Royal Thai Govt is already an
                            active participant in virtually all regional organizations, either
                            indigenous to Asia or involving participation of outsiders as well, and
                            believes there is the prospect both for further strengthening of such
                            institutions and for the Asian members to carry a progressively greater
                            share in the effort. The Thai do not believe, however, that either such
                            organizations or the region in general can achieve its potential without
                            support from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other nations
                            outside the region continuing for a further period.</p>

                        <p>14847. For Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> &amp; Asst.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Before departing Bangkok to return to Washington I would like to give
                            you a sketch of the way things look from here with regard to Thai-<gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations. Some of the points mentioned
                            are not at this time known to the Thai but if and when they are, I
                            anticipate a cumulatively negative reaction which could well jeopardize
                            close and effective relations which we have sought to maintain with the
                            Thai over many years. My concern is further heightened because of the
                            unfavorable publicity which I very much fear may result from the
                            Symington hearings on Thailand.</p>
                        <p>2. The factors I have in mind are in a number of different fields but
                            they all have in common what the Thais will take as an indication of
                            acceleration disengagement on our part. These are the more pertinent
                            factors:</p>
                        <p>(A) The decision which has apparently been taken to terminate the
                            activities of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in Thailand which
                            are “on behalf of the Thai Government” (see memo from Henry <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to Frank Shakespeare October
                            9, copy to SecState).<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">Not found.</note> We
                            have been working steadily for some time now to get the Thai Government
                            to assume more and more informational activities but I have been intent
                            on continuing our support of necessary functions until the Thai were
                            ready and able to take over. The order cited appears to foreclose any
                            such orderly handover.</p>
                        <p>(B) Reduction of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military forces in
                            Thailand: Although this action also has its constructive side if
                            carefully executed, it nevertheless adds to the preoccupation of the
                            Thais when combined with the other factors mentioned here. Furthermore,
                            it would become a strongly negative factor if we should move too quickly
                            to proceed beyond what is already programmed.</p>
                        <p>(C) The serious doubts raised about the continuing validity of the
                            contingency planning with the Thai (Project Taksin) and therefore
                            growing doubts about the credibility of our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> commitment.</p>
                        <p>(D) The downward trend in our economic aid as contrasted with high level
                            assurances that we will continue to assist Thailand to handle its own
                            problems through economic and military aid.</p>
                        <p>(E) The continuing Congressional and press criticism of Thailand (and our
                            other allies in this region) which seems to concentrate on castigating
                            just those who are most willing to help the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>; the most recent <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0124"
                            />unhappy case is Otto Passman in the Thai and other loans to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to help out on the balance of
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>(F) Our apparent reluctance to continue <gloss target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1"
                                >Sierra Romeo</gloss> which has been a major element in our close
                            cooperation with the Thais to employ all of the limited means available
                            to us to try to stave off disaster in Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. I continue to assume that Thailand is of importance to us and that we
                            wish to continue to enjoy the facilities and privileges we have here,
                            such as those relating to the prosecution of the war in Vietnam and our
                            actions in Laos, as well as certain highly classified vitally important
                            activities. I also assume that Thailand, as the heart of Southeast Asia,
                            is important to us as the key probably to assuring that that part of
                            Southeast Asia which lies beyond continues in friendly hands.</p>
                        <p>4. Unless my assumptions are in error, the independence and friendly
                            disposition of Thailand towards us must continue to be a priority
                            objective in this part of the world. Heretofore our shared conviction
                            with the Thais that we were working toward essentially the same goals
                            and that we were both prepared to make contributions toward those goals
                            assured a relationship of mutual confidence. We are now beginning to
                            raise real doubts about our future intentions and beginning to undermine
                            our close relations without which we could not expect to enjoy here the
                            advantages we have had in the past. The reports about the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>'s reviewing its foreign relations
                            (Bangkok 14722)<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">Dated November 1.
                                (Ibid.)</note> is one of a few significant straws in the wind of and
                            “agonizing reappraisal” which the Thais may in due course reluctantly
                            decide they must take.</p>
                        <p>5. These are fundamental points which have to be considered when we are
                            weighing the nature and the level of our programs in Thailand in the
                            coming period. Decisions on these matters which cumulatively signal
                            growing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> disinterest and disengagement
                            will surely undermine and perhaps in due course destroy the effective
                            and constructive relations we have had with the Thais for so long. I
                            hope this is not where we mean to be heading.</p>

                        <p>—It has reported in extenso (and I think over-interpreted) a Bangkok Post
                            article to the effect that Thailand may have to make policy
                            “readjustments” in view of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy
                            changes.</p>
                        <p>—It has dwelt upon evidence of the expansion of insurgency on the

                        <p>—We are readjusting our policy, and it is natural and desirable that the
                            Thai also engage in “readjustments.” (e.g. broadened international <pb

                        <p>—You wonder what the content really would be of a Thai “agonizing
                            reappraisal.” Would the Thai leadership seriously think they could go
                            over to the Communists? Or would they more likely seek means and
                            redouble their efforts to maintain Thai independence and their own

                            clear that you heard the Thai themselves express the feeling that
                            popularization of the Thai King and Government should be done by the
                            Thai. The President feels this very strongly, and has instructed that we
                            look not only at Thailand but at our USIS operations elsewhere to see
                            whether they are over-involved in the internal affairs of host
                            countries.</p>

                                finally let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee see a copy of the
                                Taksin Plan on November 7. A Marine one-star general brought it to
                                the Capitol, where it was perused by Senators <persName

                                    >Fulbright</persName> said, “I really don't want a copy … This
                                resolves it.”</note> He said that despite our assurance, he must
                            assume that for all practical purposes “Plan Taksin is out in the open
                            now.” I pointed out that we hoped to keep the content of the plan
                            secret, but he shrugged his shoulders and remarked that the essence of
                            the plan has already been revealed in the papers to the extent of
                            revealing that it is a Thai-U.S. contingency plan for responding to a
                            threat through Laos. He therefore feels that the other side knows more
                            about our plans than we do about theirs.</p>
                        <p>2. I reminded him of the assurances contained in para 2 of State
                                160368<note n="5" xml:id="d35fn5">Not printed.</note> to the effect
                            that we still support Plan Taksin. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> replied that he accepts implicitly the
                            President's support of the plan but that he cannot overlook the fact
                            that “a lot of water has flowed under the bridge in the past two or
                            three months.” He said that it is no longer possible to have confidence
                            that the Senate would permit the plan to be executed even were the
                            appropriate contingency to arise.</p>
                        <p>3. He appreciated my offer to keep him informed regarding the progress of
                            the hearings and concurred with my expression of hope that press leaks
                            or critical public statements would not be allowed to pit <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> against each other. Nevertheless, he argues that the
                            problem is in the United States—not in Thailand, which he described as
                            “a silent partner.”</p>
                        <p>4. On the whole I believe that my representation to him, and in
                            particular the expression of desire to coordinate with the Thai to avoid
                                <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0128"/>misunderstandings, was
                            useful. Although it is quite apparent that <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> is deeply worried about the hearings and their
                            impact and that he relates this to “the water which has flowed under the
                            bridge,” which in his view undermines the solidity of our relationship.
                            I believe the foregoing illustrates how important it is that we be
                            provided with daily reports on the hearings in order that we may
                            maintain regular liaison with the Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>5. Since drafting foregoing, I have just received State 190375<note n="6"

                                    >Green</persName> said that it had been decided that it was “a

                                forestall further criticism so that the committee “would recognize
                                it for what it was, a contingency plan.” During the <persName

                            the hearings. It reported that the subcommittee had asked probing
                            questions about the meaning of the phrase “constitutional processes” in
                            connection with implementing the Taksin contingency plan, and had asked

                            commitments.” It noted that some of the Senators had been strongly
                            critical of U.S. payments to the RTAVF and of the alleged failure of
                            Thailand to bear its “proper share of Vietnam war burden.” The telegram

                            and have them keep that in mind. When Symington agreed with the

                            ref B, explained the reasons for showing Plan Taksin to the Committee,
                            and pointed out that Ambassador Unger had been at great pains to protect
                            Plan Taksin in the hearings and to reassure the subcommittee that our
                            commitments are limited to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.
                            Characteristically (and unlike <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>), <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName>
                            was inclined to be sympathetic and understanding of our problems and
                            appreciative of our efforts to minimize the danger. He understands that
                            there will inevitably be some unfortunate leaks or public statements,
                            and while he will be angry when they occur, he is not inclined to punish
                            us before they occur.</p>
                        <p>2. Without mentioning subcommittee criticisms of the Thai contribution in
                            Vietnam or U.S. personnel, payments to the RTAVF, etc., I did tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> that the committee is,
                            of course, interested in obtaining a review of these aspects of Thai and
                            U.S. cooperation in the Vietnam war. I emphasized that while we would
                            have to explain to the committee our support to the RTAVF we would
                            expect to keep this kind of thing confidential.</p>
                        <p>3. I believe this very once-over-lightly treatment with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> was useful and will be helpful at
                            some future time. In view of <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>'s rather cool attitude two days ago and
                            Birabhongse's critical attitude to our political counselor yesterday, I
                            believe we will go slowly with the Foreign Minister. The Department
                            should know that under my instructions to <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"

                                November 17, reported that, in response to public transcripts and
                                press releases by the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                                    >Symington</persName> subcommittee implicitly criticizing Asian
                                allies in Vietnam for needing U.S. assistance, the Department of
                                State had contingency guidance “which could be used along general
                                following lines: a) the United States provides equipment and
                                supplies, training, overseas allowances, and other kinds of support.
                                b) The contribution by these nations to the Vietnam conflict and the
                                support they receive from the U.S. cannot be characterized as
                                ‘mercenary’ in nature since each of the countries concerned decided
                                on its own to contribute to a cause it supports by reason of its own
                                national interests and security. c) All three countries (Thailand,
                                Philippines, and South Korea) had needed military and economic
                                assistance for years and would be obviously unable to finance an
                                overseas force without assistance while still facing considerable
                                challenges at home.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I briefed Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> today on the basis of reftel, giving him the text
                            of subparagraphs 3 a, b, and c. I did not take up the questions and
                            answers in paragraph 4 since those deal solely with the Philippines and
                            would probably have alarmed <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            prematurely since he would regard them as a harbinger of future
                            questioning regarding the Black Panthers.</p>
                        <p>2. Even so, the relatively bland contingency guidance of paragraph 3
                            stimulated his blood pressure. He resented the necessity to deny the
                            characterization “mercenary” and remarked that “if the senators are
                            opposed to the presence of Thai forces in South Vietnam, we could very
                            easily withdraw them and on quite short notice as well.” I tried to
                            explain to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> that the focus
                            of the subcommittee's interest was quite different and that, if
                            anything, some Senators had been critical of other east Asian countries
                            for not having contributed to the <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0134"
                            />Vietnam war, even though their security was at stake. However, this
                            charge certainly could not be levied at Thailand, which had supported
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the war in countless ways, I
                            had some difficulty making this explanation in the face of several
                            interruptions from <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> who was
                            intent upon insisting that I report fully what he had said regarding the
                            ability of the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> to withdraw the Black
                            Panthers, “if the Senate does not like them.”</p>
                        <p>3. I informed <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> that the
                            hearings were completed and that as far as I knew they had gone better
                            in the latter part than during the first two days. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> quizzed me on the “sanitization
                            process” which preceded publication of the report on the Filipino
                            hearings. He is obviously fearful that the sanitization will not be very
                            thorough and he clearly expects the worst when it comes to Thailand's
                            turn.</p>

                            <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0135"/>The implication of the latter
                            issue of course is that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> paid for
                            Thai “mercenaries”, and the Thai resent this implication as well as what
                            they regard as another instance of unfair criticism of them in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press— in itself, a long-standing
                            irritant in our relations.</p>
                        <p>Behind the immediate problems in our relations is a belief on the part of
                            the Thai leaders that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitment
                            in the area will indeed decrease over time, and they are seeking means
                            to assure Thai independence in the changed context. They are worried
                            over the prospect that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> withdrawal
                            from Vietnam will proceed at a rate which would leave Thailand and other
                            free nations exposed to a Chinese and North Vietnamese communist threat.
                            The long-term threat from China is their greatest concern.</p>
                        <p>Most immediately, the Thai leaders are apprehensive that once the US
                            withdraws from Vietnam, Laos may fall to the Communists who will then
                            give direct large-scale aid across the Mekong River to the insurgency in
                            the Northeast. Over the longer-term, they are worried about their
                            ability to contain the Peking-backed insurgency in the North.</p>
                        <p>The constancy of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support, then, becomes
                            a matter of great importance to the Thai. Any developments in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which appear to question this constancy
                            cause over-reaction in Thailand. Our Embassy is anxious to smooth things
                            down and prevent the Thai tendency to over-react. At the same time, we
                            feel that some officers in the Embassy may be over-solicitous on behalf
                            of their Thai clients, who are perhaps more mature and capable than the
                            Embassy gives them credit for, and who appreciate the realities of
                            Southeast Asian developments despite a tendency to react emotionally to
                            the issues of the moment. (For example, the Embassy is upset at our
                            decision to cease the activities of USIS mobile information units which
                            have been doing what the Thai themselves should be doing in calling for
                            loyalty to the King and the Government. The Thai themselves expressed
                            criticism of these units to me last summer.)</p>
                        <p>The President's visit to Thailand last July helped to reassure the Thai
                            as to the continued <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role in support of
                            Thailand, as restated in the President's Guam doctrine, and your visit
                            should have the same effect. They are on our side, and are proceeding in
                            the directions which we favor such as supporting regionalism and

                            withdraw their troops from Vietnam out of pique over their treatment in

                        <p>a. The Thai will want to unburden themselves on what they consider
                            unjustified <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public and Congressional
                            criticism of their role in Vietnam. They may do so in emotional terms.
                            This may be more of a means of blowing off steam than an expression of a
                            real crisis in our relations, and may, in fact, have a therapeutic
                            effect.</p>

                        <p>b. The Thai will be worried about the present situation in Laos, and
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is doing enough to hold
                            back the Communists there. They are also worried that an eventual
                            Vietnam settlement will provide adequate protection to the integrity of
                            Laos, or prevent Communist infiltration through Laos into Thailand. They
                            will want your reassurances.</p>
                        <p>c. They may want to elicit your thoughts on the future of Southeast Asia

                            highly indignant because they think we “ordered” the <gloss

                            metric tons of rice from Thailand. (In fact, we have regularly supplied
                            Vietnam's rice requirements through <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            480, to save foreign exchange. The possibility of a Thai sale arose from
                            a momentary shortage in Saigon which we were able to meet through a
                            diversion of a PL 480 shipment from a third country to Vietnam. We did
                            not order the Vietnamese to do anything, but their requirements were met
                            by this arrangement. While we do not regard South Vietnam as a normal
                            marketing area for Thai rice, we are very sensitive to Thai feelings on
                            the question of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 rice sales, and
                            will continue to consult and to endeavor to minimize frictions. You

                        <p>a. To reassure the Thai of the constancy of <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            in his Guam Doctrine. (The Thai appear to understand the revised <gloss

                            confidence placed in them that they are capable of handling internal
                            subversion.)</p>
                        <p>b. To downplay the effects of what may appear to the Thai as unjustified
                            criticism. This of course represents only a small percentage of American
                            opinion and certainly is not indicative of the attitude either of the
                            Administration or the great majority of Americans.</p>
                        <p>c. To reassure the Thai of their own ability to handle the insurgency in
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>d. To encourage the trend toward self-confidence, self-help and

                            position and the importance of Laos to Thai security. Recall that our
                            side has insisted that a satisfactory settlement in Laos is an integral
                            part of any solution in Vietnam.</p>

                            demonstrates how clearly the people of Thailand see the issues in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>—We are also grateful for the great assistance which Thailand has
                            provided through the US-Thai airbases in Thailand in support of the
                            Vietnam war. We recognize that countless American lives have been saved
                            because of the existence of these bases.</p>

                            carried out in keeping with the South Vietnamese ability to take over.

                        <p>—The Thai Government has little love for Sihanouk, although it has
                            expressed willingness to normalize relations if he takes the initiative.
                            The Thai are probably unenthusiastic about our decision to resume
                            diplomatic relations with Cambodia. If they raise the issue, you might
                            turn it aside with the observation that Sihanouk has caused all of us
                            problems, but that none of us want to see Cambodia pulled toward the
                            Communists, and that we might both derive some advantage from a <gloss

                        <p>1. During conversation I had this morning with <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> on another subject, he volunteered brief rundown
                            his discussions in Kuala Lumpur with <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> Lam on subject of withdrawal
                            of Thai forces in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            told me his purpose in discussing this was to establish the principle
                            that Thai forces were not intended to remain in <gloss target="#t_RVN1"
                                >RVN</gloss> indefinitely and that they could be withdrawn once
                            circumstances permitted. In response to my question whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> was currently making any such plans to
                            withdraw, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said this was not
                            the case. He said underlying objective in making his statement to the
                            press about the possibility of Thai withdrawal reftel was to convey to
                            Hanoi another indication of the growing capability of the South
                            Vietnamese to take care of their own problems and also to blunt thrust
                            of Hanoi propaganda. He asked me to keep in strictest confidence his
                            acknowledgment that no plans for withdrawal were actually underway as
                            well as his motivation, with Hanoi as the target, of raising in public
                            the possibility of Thai withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>2. I said that we are also convinced of the value of the Vietnamization
                            policy as means, inter alia, undercutting the <gloss target="#t_NVN1"
                                >NVN</gloss> propaganda effort. I added that at same time we saw
                            continuing value in having some Thai forces in Vietnam. He said he knew
                            this and we did not need to convince Thailand on this score. He added
                            that some of the people in the government, including some military, did
                            not understand the political and psychological reasons for his public
                            statement re withdrawal Thai forces from Vietnam. He then left for the
                            Tuesday cabinet meeting at which he said this issue would be discussed
                            and, presumably, his initiative will be explained to those less
                            sophisticated. 3. Department please transmit Embassies Saigon, Vientiane

                            was used in describing the incident,) (b) the Thai government is
                            nevertheless willing to work closely with us to find ways in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might make “amends” by purchase of
                            other goods from Thailand to an equivalent amount for use in aid to
                            Vietnam and Laos, and (c) it is urgent that such amends be made by
                            January 3–4 when the Vice President arrives in Bangkok “so that the
                            circumstances of the Vice President's visit will be the most favorable.”

                        <p>The amends business was suggested by Len Unger to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">3½
                                lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Nevertheless, if
                            anything can be done, I believe that appropriate steps should, in fact,
                            be taken. The element of “face” is deeply bound into the situation,
                            since the Thai Minister of Economic Affairs was actually in Saigon and
                            the deal was all set to be concluded except for his signature when we
                            intervened and killed it. I believe that they are smarting under what
                            appears to them to be a low, and totally unexpected blow from a country
                            which professes to be an ally. In addition, a great part of Thailand's
                            foreign exchange earnings comes from rice sales, and we have hit them
                            where it really hurts even though their economy is not likely to
                            collapse through loss of this one deal.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation with the Chargé, I simply told him that I would report
                            carefully to you what he had said, and also expressed sympathy with the
                            Thai position. I assured him of the constancy of our relationship <pb
                                n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0140"/>with Thailand, and that we
                            regarded the Thai as true friends and good allies. This, I said, was
                            exemplified by the President's remarks in Bangkok last July. I asked the
                            Chargé if he had passed the word to the Department of State to which he
                            informed me he had earlier today called on Under Secretary
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>. The Under Secretary, it seemed, had
                            taken the responsibility for having ordered the course of action which
                            the U.S. had taken in this case.</p>
                        <p>As per your instructions, I have informed the Chargé that we will try to
                            work something out by January 3rd.</p>

                        <p>You asked for a recommendation as to what we can do to salve Thai
                            feelings over the recent cancellation of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> rice contract.</p>
                        <p>I have told State that something needs to be done, that we leave it to
                            them to propose specific measures, but that there must be something
                            which the Vice President can offer when he arrives in Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>I am told by State that—accidentally, I hope—one of the two diverted
                            ships containing <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 rice for Vietnam
                            has sunk.</p>
                        <p>As a result, there are two immediate possibilities:</p>
                        <p>—we can encourage the Vietnamese to go to the Thai for 10,000 tons of
                            rice, and the Vice President can let the Thai know that we are doing
                            so.</p>
                        <p>—we can encourage the Vietnamese to buy some 30,000 tons of sugar from
                            Thailand. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> has
                            already been informally discussing this idea with the Thai
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I believe that with the application of continuing pressure from here, I
                            can be confident that we will have a firm policy decision on one of
                            these two possibilities for the Vice President to use in Bangkok.</p>

                            Meeting With P.M. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Vice President Agnew met for nearly two hours on Jan 4th with Prime
                            Minister Thanom and other Thai officials. Those attending the meeting on
                            the Thai side included: <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>, <persName

                            Sompong (Director General of Economic Affairs in the Foreign Office).
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> and Messrs.
                            Crane and Duemling attended with the Vice President.</p>
                        <p>2. Problems in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Thai Relations. The
                            Prime Minister stated that the Thai had been very pleased with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit last summer but
                            several problems had cropped up since then. They were therefore
                            delighted to have another chance to discuss matters of common interest
                            with the Vice President. The Vice President responded that he was making
                            his trip at President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                            request and noted that we <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0142"/>too
                            felt the need for a forthright dialogue. Although it would probably be
                            difficult to get into detail, he felt that a discussion of intent would
                            be useful at this time. Simply stated the intent of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is to maintain the excellent relations
                            which we have enjoyed with Thailand over the years.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Intentions. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> said he would appreciate clarification on
                            “the so-called commitment of the United States to Thailand and Southeast
                            Asia.” The Vice President stated that his response would reflect U.S.
                            integrity and intent in the area and that was just the sort of thing he
                            wanted to discuss. He stated that the United States stands by its
                            commitment to Thailand and will discharge its responsibilities as a
                            Pacific power. There might be changes in technology which would call for
                            specific readjustments in our defense posture, but this would in no way
                            affect our commitments to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> or any
                            of the other less formal arrangements with Thailand.</p>
                        <p>4. The Vice President then took the initiative to provide brief
                            assurances on several other questions affecting <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>/Thai relations:</p>
                        <p>A. The Vice President felt that we could have consulted more effectively
                            with the Thai prior to making announcements of troop withdrawals in
                            Vietnam. He felt we should and could do better in the future and planned
                            to make a strong recommendation on this score to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>B. The United States greatly regretted the inconvenience and
                            embarrassment to Thai officials which occurred when their projected sale
                            of 20,000 tons of rice to South Vietnam fell through. We hope to be able
                            to find some new economic opportunities which would make up for the loss
                            of the sale. In this regard, the Vice President was encouraged to note
                            that the South Vietnamese may be needing another 10,000 tons of rice
                            from Thailand since the United States is not in a position to provide
                            this.</p>
                        <p>C. The United States will continue to assist Thailand in combatting
                            insurgency. We intend to continue our economic and military aid
                            programs. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is looking favorably
                            upon Thailand's requests for additional helicopters and M–16 rifles.
                            Without going into detail, the Vice President stated that we hoped to
                            deliver a substantial number of M–16s early this year.</p>
                        <p>D. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> clearly understands the
                            importance of Laos to Thailand and we are concerned with the situation
                            there. The Vice President assured the Thai that we felt any agreement
                            reached at the Paris Peace Talks should recognize the integrity of Laos
                            and call for the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from that country
                            back into North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. Project Taksin. The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for the
                            reassurances offered by the VP. He said that he had raised the <pb
                                n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0143"/>issue of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> commitments because the Thai were concerned over recent
                            comments by high-ranking officials in the United States, not only
                            Senators but Secretary Laird. The Thai could not understand our Defense
                            Secretary's statement that Plan Taksin did not have either his or the
                            President's approval.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">See <ref

                            this statement, it was still most disturbing to the Thai. The Vice
                            President replied that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName>'s statement could be best understood in its local
                            Washington context. The Secretary had merely been attempting to put out
                            a political fire—a fire which the Vice President felt had begun with
                            some rather irresponsible comments in the Senate. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> had been attempting to dispel the
                            false impression created by the media that the United States had secret
                            contingency agreements which could be automatically activated without
                            further review by the Secretary of Defense or the President. The Sec of
                            Defense frankly had not had the occasion to review in detail and approve
                            Project Taksin since this would likely take place only in an emergency
                            situation when the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be
                            considering how best to help the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. Thai Support for <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. The Vice
                            President expressed concern that troublemakers were attempting to drive
                            a wedge between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and its friends by
                            implying that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was planning to
                            withdraw from this part of the world. We should not put much stock in
                            such rumors and propaganda. As an example of how such rumors could upset
                            people, the Vice President mentioned that we had heard that the Thai
                            might be planning to drop out of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>. Although just a rumor, this concerned us greatly and we
                            certainly hoped it was not true.</p>
                        <p>7. The Prime Minister responded that recent insulting comments by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Senators had been most upsetting to the
                            Thai, Filipinos and others. These insults, plus revelations of what the
                            Thai regarded as classified defense plans, adversely affected the normal
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> relationships. However, the
                            Thai have no desire to withdraw from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> or to see it broken up. As a matter of fact, the Thai
                            have tolerated the lukewarm attitude and actions of certain European
                            members of the Treaty Organization. The Prime Minister stated flatly
                            that the Thai intend to keep working hard to preserve the regional
                            defense arrangement.</p>
                        <p>8. The Vice President agreed that a few Senators have done serious
                            disservice to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in the way they have
                            talked about our allies. Their statements were being played up by our
                            enemies in an effort to try to destroy <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss>. On this score the Vice President had told President
                            Marcos, and he wished now to repeat to the Prime Minister, that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> remained firm in its resolve to
                            support <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. It was most important,
                            in the Vice President's view, not to allow troublemakers to disturb <pb
                                n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0144"/>the good relations which existed
                            between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and its allies. The Vice
                            President noted that Senators have many prerogatives but he felt that
                            recent actions by some Senators had been less than statesmanlike.
                            Leaving the question of substance aside for the moment, he regretted
                            that their manner had been so insulting. As an American the Vice
                            President felt obliged to apologize, even though neither he nor the
                            President had any control over members of the Legislative Branch.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> Hearings. The Prime
                            Minister expressed his appreciation for the Vice President's statement,
                            however he still felt obliged to touch upon those very derogatory
                            statements which alleged that Thai soldiers were being used as
                            mercenaries in Vietnam. Feeling was running high in Thailand over these
                            insults, and many people felt the US does not appreciate what the Thai
                            are doing in Vietnam. The Prime Minister could not hide the fact that
                            the Thai had been dismayed by such statements as “the Thai are the best
                            allies money can buy.”</p>
                        <p>10. The Vice President again expressed his regret, and noted that such
                            comments certainly do not reflect a majority of American views. He said
                            that he himself had come in for a great deal of abuse, often from the
                            same sources. The mercenary argument was so weak, in the Vice
                            President's opinion, that he doubted any fair-minded American would
                            subscribe to it. Mercenaries had historically fought far from home and
                            had never felt any particular “involvement” in the conflicts they
                            participated in. It is impossible to imagine that the Thai are not
                            vitally concerned with what happens in Vietnam, so the mercenary
                            argument really makes no sense. On the contrary, people in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> are most grateful for the efforts of Thai
                            volunteers in Vietnam and realize that any support we can give the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is but a small token of our
                            appreciation for its help. The Vice President was certain that such
                            outrageous statements would never strike a responsive chord in the minds
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public. He hoped that a more
                            cool appraisal by the Cabinet would indicate that the offending Senators
                            certainly did not speak for the United States.</p>
                        <p>11. The Prime Minister said he would like nothing better than to believe
                            these assurances, but after all, in a democracy the repetition of
                            falsehoods, even by a small minority, might snowball into a situation
                            which could force a change in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy.
                            He pointed out that even in Thailand five Peace Corps volunteers had
                            demonstrated against the Vice President's arrival. (Note: Investigation
                            is still underway to ascertain the precise nature of this demonstration
                            and its participants.) 12. The Vice President indicated he felt that the
                            anti-war demonstrations had reached their highpoint with the Moratorium
                            marches in November. Despite the media treatment of the demonstrations,
                            it now seemed clear that they had so completely failed to attract public
                            support that additional announced demonstrations had been cancelled. <pb
                                n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0145"/>Rather than provoking changes in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy, the demonstrations had in
                            fact caused Americans to coalesce behind the administration's position.
                            Public opinion polls and mail received since the President's November 3
                            television speech had clearly shown the public support for our policies
                            in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>13. Insurgency Problems. The Vice President asked the Prime Minister to
                            give him a rundown of the current status of the insurgency in Thailand.
                            The Prime Minister replied that the situation was generally under
                            control, but that since the end of the rainy season, infiltration from
                            Laos appeared to be increasing. In response to a question, he stated
                            that increased infiltration in the north and in the northeast seemed to
                            be under a centralized command. The Thai were working hard to interdict
                            the infiltrators. The Prime Minister wished to reiterate that while
                            Thailand intends to rely on its own forces to combat insurgency, the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will need to receive material
                            support for its forces. The Prime Minister had spoken to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on this point and had
                            felt that he was receptive. The Vice President confirmed that we wished
                            to be receptive to Thai military aid requests. The Prime Minister stated
                            that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> counter-insurgency policy
                            was not simply one of meeting force with force, but also relied heavily
                            on attempting to improve economic conditions. He claimed the Thai were
                            committing “enormous resources to rural development.” In addition, they
                            were working hard to improve the quality of local officials and to
                            involve the local populace directly in government programs. The Vice
                            President stated that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> was most impressed with the way the Thai were
                            approaching their insurgency problem, and added that we respect their
                            right to chart their own course in this area.</p>
                        <p>14. <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480. The Prime Minister touched
                            briefly on the Thai concern over their loss of the rice sale to South
                            Vietnam. Rice sales, after all, were not economically important to the
                            United States, but were of vital importance to Thailand where they were
                            taxed by the Govt. and were thus of importance as a source of revenue as
                            well as foreign exchange. He felt that there had not been sufficient
                            consultation between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> on this question. The Vice President said we were very
                            aware of the problem which had developed and hoped that some sort of
                            compensatory deal could be worked out between the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                            >GVN</gloss>. In addition, the Vice President pledged that we would try
                            harder to consult more closely on matters of economic importance to
                            Thailand in the future.</p>
                        <p>15. In a related discussion on economic development, the VP underlined
                            the importance of the role which can be played by private business and
                            investment, and mentioned the residence problems of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> businessmen in Thailand. The PM
                            acknowledged this and said he had asked the Cabinet to find a
                            solution.</p>
                        <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0146"/>
                        <p>16. Thai Troop Withdrawals. The Prime Minister moved to the question of
                            future Thai troop withdrawals from Vietnam. He said that any withdrawals
                            would be related to improvement in the Vietnam situation and to security
                            requirements in Thailand, and would not be based on <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or Australian withdrawal schedules. If
                            problems develop in Thailand requiring more troops, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will simply have to withdraw from
                            Vietnam. However, the Thai will consult first with their allies,
                            particularly the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The Vice President
                            agreed that adequate advance consultation is of major importance to
                            prevent doubts from clouding our relations and to avoid providing our
                            enemies with propaganda opportunities. We have been deficient in this
                            regard ourselves, and will make every effort to consult more closely on
                            our plans in the future.</p>
                        <p>17. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Relations With Communist Countries.
                            The Vice President asked the Prime Minister for his views on the
                            Sino-Soviet split. After brief comments the Prime Minister said that
                            since the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had entered into discussions
                            with both the Russians and the <gloss target="#t_CHICOMS1"
                                >ChiComs</gloss>, he hoped the Vice President might provide the Thai
                            leaders with some new insights. The Vice President replied that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> believes he has a
                            responsibility to try to lessen world tensions. Accordingly, we have
                            begun some very important discussions on strategic arms limitation with
                            the Soviet Union. It is too early to tell how the talks will turn out,
                            but we are sincere in our attempt to plumb Soviet intentions.</p>
                        <p>18. In addition, we have made some small moves toward Communist China
                            which are designed to determine how intransigent their policies are. As
                            the Thai know, we have received no encouragement from the <gloss
                                target="#t_CHICOMS1">ChiComs</gloss> so far. The Prime Minister
                            commented that these moves toward the <gloss target="#t_CHICOMS1"
                                >ChiComs</gloss> had raised some doubts in the minds of our Asian
                            friends, especially in the Republic of China. The Vice President once
                            again offered assurances that our intentions to reduce tensions should
                            in no way be construed as a diminuation of our commitments to our
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>19. In closing the Vice President expressed appreciation for the candor
                            and understanding expressed by the Prime Minister. The discussions were
                            valuable to the Vice President personally, and to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. The Vice President looked forward to a
                            continued, mutually beneficial relationship with the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>, and in response the Prime Minister
                            expressed appreciation for the assurances which the Vice President had

                        <p>Vipto 12/19. Dept pass Bangkok. VP Channel. Subj: Vice President's
                            Meeting With the King and Queen of Thailand January 4, 1970.</p>
                        <p>1. The meeting was held at the Royal Palace. In attendance were the King,
                            Queen, Prime Minister, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName>, Commander Cernan, as well as other aides.</p>
                        <p>2. The meeting began with an exchange of gifts between the principals and
                            presentation to the King of the Thai flag and moon rocks by Commander
                            Cernan.</p>
                        <p>3. Surprisingly, there was very little small talk between the King and
                            me, and he moved quickly to the substantive matters. He expressed his
                            concern over the Symington Subcommittee's testimony with particular
                            regard to the characterization of the Thai soldiers as “mercenaries”. I
                            assured him that this was not the prevalent American opinion and that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wished the Thai
                            people to be aware of the continuing appreciation of the United States
                            for their support in Vietnam and for their effective battle against
                            insurgency in the north and northeast of their own country.</p>
                        <p>4. The King expressed grave concern over the situation in Laos,
                            indicating that very serious mistakes were made at the time of the 1962
                            Geneva Accords—principally the failure to partition Laos in such a
                            manner as to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail. When I inquired about the
                            activities of the Pathet Lao, he indicated that their effort would
                            collapse without active North Vietnamese cadres prodding them and
                            threatening them with execution should they not continue the fight
                            against the Laotian Government.</p>
                        <p>5. The King indicated that the Thais were very concerned that a possible
                            settlement in South Vietnam would not include a satisfactory requirement
                            that the North Vietnamese withdraw entirely from Laos. I assured him
                            that his position was understood and that we would consult in advance
                            with the Thai Government to make certain that the Laotian situation was
                            satisfactorily covered in any final agreement with the Communists.</p>
                        <p>6. I asked the King about <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>
                            and how he appraised the present Cambodian position. I expressed concern
                            over the augmentation <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0148"/>of
                            shipments through Cambodia, particularly since the Vietnamization
                            program was under its severest test in the Delta area. The King said
                            that he felt <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> was playing
                            a dangerous game, but that he was virtually the captive of a nearly
                            impossible situation. The moment that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                                >Sihanouk</persName> ceases to cooperate marginally with the
                            Communists, the King said, he would be faced with wide-spread and
                            effective insurgency which would probably result in his overthrow.
                            Moreover, the King felt that so long as <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                                >Sihanouk</persName> closed his eyes to the flow of Communist
                            materials through his country he was in a better position to at least
                            allow some American observation. He indicated that the Thailand-Cambodia
                            ill feeling had receded to some extent and that he appreciated the
                            difficulty of <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s
                            position.</p>
                        <p>7. The King is very worried about increasing Communist capability in
                            stimulating the insurgency in Thailand. The intention of the Communists
                            is demonstrated by their focus of effort on the road construction
                            program in Laos, and particularly the road that leads southwest toward
                            Thailand. The King said that he did not think <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                                >Souvanna Phouma</persName> wanted to encourage this venture, but
                            that he did not know how to cut it off, having agreed to Communist road
                            building assistance in other northern areas of Laos. The King's fear is
                            that a good road will allow the rapid movement of troops and materials
                            from North Vietnam to the Thai borders and that the supplying of the
                            insurrection will become much easier.</p>
                        <p>8. My general impression of the King was very favorable. I assess him to
                            be an extremely brilliant and intense young man who has a remarkable
                            capability of concentration. Whatever he attempts he seems to throw
                            himself completely into, and I would judge that he has a greater effect
                            on the foreign policy of Thailand than the conventional monarch. He
                            seems to have great social awareness and indicated that he was moving to
                            provide increased social assistance to his people in the areas of
                            education, health and land reform.</p>

                        <p>Our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 Congressional Request for the
                            Thailand program was $45 million. Due to Congressional action on our
                            request for funds, <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0150"/>A.I.D.
                            expects to reduce many of its country programs this year. Because
                            Thailand competes with Vietnam for scarce supporting assistance funds,
                            we will not be able to provide the full <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1970 amount originally proposed. Taking into account
                            funds still in the pipeline from prior year obligations, we believe our
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 program requirements can be
                            satisfied with up to $30.0 million: $22 million supporting assistance,
                            and $8.0 million technical assistance, including family planning. Our
                            assistance to Thailand plays a three-fold role by: (1) providing actual
                            resources to help carry out Thailand's counterinsurgency effort; (2)
                            promoting greater Thai attention and resource allocation to
                            counterinsurgency measures and providing us an opportunity to influence
                            the direction of this Thai effort—the primary aim of our program; (3)
                            demonstrating continuing high-level interest in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the above, we believe a program level of about $30.0
                            million essentially is adequate for the first two considerations.
                            However, a $30.0 million program will not completely satisfy the
                            third.</p>
                        <p>The Thais have become increasingly concerned that a Vietnam settlement
                            will affect adversely their own security. At the same time, they have a
                            growing doubt about the nature and extent of U.S. interest in Southeast
                            Asia in general and Thailand in particular. A.I.D. obligations for the
                            Thailand program are considered by the Thais as one indication of this
                            interest. Thus, anything less than last year's obligation level of about
                            $35.5 million will raise questions in their minds about our commitment.
                            However, since a program of about $30.0 million is all our projects
                            usefully can absorb, a consideration understood by the Thais, we believe
                            adverse political reaction can be minimized and therefore are
                            recommending this program level for Presidential approval.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. U.S. A.I.D. Objectives and Strategy:</p>
                        <p>Thailand's importance to the U.S. lies in its key position in Southeast
                            Asia, its key role in the economic and political development of the
                            region, and its close cooperation with the U.S., particularly in support
                            of our Vietnam effort. The basic U.S. assistance objective is to improve
                            the Thai capacity for dealing with a Communist-supported insurgency
                            threat.</p>
                        <p>The primary purpose of our program is to try to get the Thais to devote
                            greater attention and allocate more resources to the security problem
                            than they would in the absence of our program. Since the Thais
                            contribute about $2 from their own budget for every U.S. dollar of
                            support to our joint projects, we exert influence not only through our
                            advisory assistance, but also directly upon their budget allocation
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Both U.S. and Thai governments recognize that the fundamental
                            responsibility for countering this insurgency belongs to the Thais. We
                                <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0151"/>have concentrated our
                            assistance in the North and Northeast of Thailand where incident rates
                            have been highest and conditions conducive to insurgency are most acute.
                            In combating the insurgency in other areas, the Royal Thai Government is
                            using the strategy developed in our joint programs in the North and
                            Northeast.</p>
                        <p>In dealing with the pressures of insurgency, Thailand has a number of
                            strengths—its history of national independence, a widely-respected Royal
                            Family, its well-established structure of government, and its strong
                            economy. However, its highly-centralized government does not yet provide
                            adequate channels for responding to local needs. Awareness and
                            understanding on the part of Thai Government officials of the needs and
                            aspirations of rural people and the increased commitment of resources
                            are essential to the solution of Thailand's security problem. This
                            weakness, even more than limitations of Thai manpower and fiscal
                            resources, has been the greatest restraint on Thai Government efforts.
                            It is this problem which is the principal focus of the A.I.D.
                            program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Nature of Program:</p>
                        <p>Within the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 program, supporting
                            assistance funds will be used primarily to facilitate Thai efforts to
                            improve security in rural areas and to support Thai rural development
                            programs. Technical assistance will be used to assist in more broadly
                            developmental programs such as agriculture research and training, a
                            river basin survey, private sector development, and improvements in Thai
                            administration in civil service.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Rural Security</p>
                        <p>Against a $30.0 million program level, about $7.0 million of supporting
                            assistance is proposed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 for
                            rural public safety programs. Our primary objective will be to help
                            develop a rural security capacity of sufficient strength and efficiency
                            to counter anticipated threats of communist terror and subversion to the
                            rural populace. A.I.D. will continue to equip the new township police
                            stations and vehicles and ammunition will be provided to the expanding
                            police forces in the villages and to the mobile backup units now being
                            manned.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 A.I.D. program includes about
                            $9.0 million for a number of rural development projects aimed primarily
                            at increasing the government's responsiveness to village needs. This is
                            a major part of our counterinsurgency strategy and is accomplished by
                            providing advisory services and construction equipment to provincial
                            authorities for impact programs such as feeder roads and small
                            ponds.</p>

                        <p>A.I.D. also will help the Thais expand and improve their education and
                            health services in the North and Northeast as an important part of our
                            security-related program, and we are planning to provide about $9.0
                            million for these purposes. We will continue to support mobile training
                            units which provide vocational training to villagers as well as provide
                            advisory services to a major Thai and International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development (<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>)

                            Thailand's rural health centers as well as its family planning

                        <p>Consistent with our aim of narrowing the gap between the villager and
                            government officials, A.I.D. support to in-service training will devote
                            particular attention to provincial and local officials, as well as
                            involve villagers in local self-government and project planning
                            techniques. Our program includes about $1.0 million for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Longer-Range Regional Development</p>
                        <p>To establish a more rational framework for allocating Thai and U.S.
                            resources to the development of the security-sensitive Northeast, we are
                            providing advisory assistance to the Thai Economic Planning Agency and
                            operating ministries in developing a plan for that area, and among other
                            activities also are helping finance a study of a river basin in
                            Northeast Thailand. We are planning to obligate about $4.0 million for
                            these activities, as well as for a few other projects such as private
                            sector development.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Planning for the Future:</p>
                        <p>While our program rationale has been under continual review, this year
                            the Agency will need to examine our program objectives and strategy for
                            Thailand even more closely to determine if they will be valid in the
                            near future. Our recent experience indicates the internal security
                            problem in Thailand, while real, is a longer-range problem than was
                            believed a few years ago. It does not pose an immediate threat to
                            Thailand's political stability. This suggests that we should devote
                            increased attention to identifying and bringing about fundamental
                            changes in the political, social and economic conditions that foster
                            insurgency, while stressing less short-run impact activities. Our
                            strategy of concentrating our assistance in the North and Northeast of
                            Thailand also must be reconsidered in this context.</p>
                        <p>Further, the situation in Thailand is being examined to determine the
                            program implications of your statements at Guam and in the capitals of
                            Southeast Asia, as well as the Administration's new Vietnam <pb n="104"
                                xml:id="pg_104" facs="0153"/>policy. We will need to consider the
                            program consequences of a postwar Vietnam settlement, with emphasis on
                            the proper balance between the Agency's bilateral and regional
                            assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>The National Security Council study on Thailand, now in the final stage
                            of preparation, will address the major options open to the U.S. in our
                            relations to Thailand, as well as the program implications of these
                            options. This study will prove particularly useful to A.I.D. in
                            conducting our review of the Thailand program.</p>
                        <p>Our current year program will not be affected by these examinations. Some
                            program adjustments will be possible in <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                                n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">Not found.</note> which reviewed importance of
                            rice to Thailand including importance of timing of export shipments and
                            adverse effects of “cutting in effected by American shipments to South
                            Viet-Nam and expected supplies to Indonesia.” Aide-mémoire concluded
                            with statement “remedial measures of long-range effects are therefore
                            essential.”</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_HS5">Sunthorn</persName> began by stating
                            Thailand has between 1.3 and 1.4 million tons of rice to sell and
                            suggested U.S. could find a way to dispose of surplus rice in a way that
                            Thailand might participate in sales to above countries, especially
                            brokens which India and Ceylon also <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                                facs="0154"/>use. Better grades of rice would be exported to
                            traditional markets of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> stated Thai should not
                            imagine that we indifferent to or ignorant of problem, mentioning among
                            other things Vice President's discussion of problem in Bangkok. Also
                            referred to Thai good fortune in having second opportunity sell 20,000
                            tons to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, which would compensate
                            original frustrated sale.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> then reviewed history
                            of rice shortage in Asia and U.S. rice acreage increase to avoid
                            potential famine followed by acreage cuts to restore world supply demand
                            equilibrium. Then explained differences of various types of markets
                            including (1) usual Thai commercial markets (i.e. Hong Kong, Malaysia,
                            Singapore), (2) Indonesia, (3) Viet-Nam and Korea and reasons for rice
                            requirements of each. Main distinction emphasized was difference between
                            aid channels and normal commercial outlets. Mutual interests and
                            benefits of greater stability in Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia,
                            were stressed and rationale for assistance to Indonesia explained in
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> mentioned long term
                            problem of dependency on rice exports and expressed gratification of
                            Thai progress in other areas such as corn. Viet-Nam and Indonesia were
                            characterized as undependable and unpredicatable markets for Thai
                            exports since, under normal circumstances, neither should be food
                            importing countries. However, <persName corresp="#p_BRW4"
                                >Barnett</persName> stressed that we not meeting all of Indonesia's
                            requirements and it up to Thai to compete for commercial rice imports
                            which amounted to about 400,000 tons during past year.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_HS5">Sunthorn</persName> indicated appreciation
                            of our position and agreed with desirability of long range
                            diversification and industrial development but stated that flexibility
                            limited in short run.</p>
                        <p>7. Memcon<note n="4" xml:id="d46fn4">Not found.</note> and copy of
                            aide-mémoire being pouched.</p>
                        <p>8. Re consultation procedures, we did not tell Sunthorn that present
                            system would be changed to accommodate <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss>. As Embassy aware, we do not initiate consultations
                            until interagency approval of proposed program obtained. Consultation
                            period of ten working days generally accepted by members <gloss

                            Disposal and unilateral decision by U.S. to give additional time to any
                            consultee would meet with opposition, including within U.S. Government.
                            Regarding Embassy follow-up in Bangkok, including supplying material to
                            local press, information on proposed agreements is not to be made
                            public, although occasionally such information has been [is] leaked.
                            Procedures have been set up for the simultaneous public release of
                            information at the time of signing between the U.S. and <pb n="106"
                                xml:id="pg_106" facs="0155"/>the recipient government. On occasion,
                            final agreements differ from the proposal communicated to the
                            consultees. This is due not only because of consultation with third
                            countries, but also subsequent negotiations with the recipient
                            government. Thus, premature announcement proposal could prejudice U.S.
                            position during negotiations as well as cause embarrassment to
                            government with which we are negotiating.</p>

                            to a perceived reorientation of U.S. policy away from strong support of
                                Thailand.<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">In the conversation reported in

                                    >Thanat</persName> concluded that the Church amendment, a

                                and Thailand, originally proposed by Senator <persName

                                18, 1969 (H–<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 91–171), would force
                                Thailand to rethink its positions and policies and perhaps base its
                                security on a pre-World War II, “or perhaps even pre-World War I,”
                                model. Unger told <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> that
                                it was his conviction that the United States Government “would
                                respond to a situation such as that envisaged in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> article IV–1 and would have the
                                support of the Congress. Circumstances at the time would dictate the
                                nature of the response and whether or not it needed ground forces.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> replied that he
                                could not ask his country to base its policy on “what decision that
                                body (Congress) would take when his country might be about to be
                                engulfed.” (Ibid.)</note> You will recall that on Saturday last you

                        <p>—Thailand faces an uncertain future security environment.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. posture in east Asia in the 1970's will be different and inevitably
                            affect U.S.-Thai relations.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. policy trend represented by the Guam Doctrine will continue in
                            a direction emphasizing Asian self-reliance and more rigorous definition
                            of U.S. security commitments.</p>
                        <p>—Reductions in U.S. general purpose forces indicate that the executive
                            branch must be more conservative than before in considering
                            contingencies in which it would risk armed conflict.</p>
                        <p>—U.S.-Thai relations are likely to be affected by “continuing, even
                            increasing, stringency in economic and military assistance
                            appropriations.”</p>
                        <p>—U.S. intentions will not require a relationship with Thailand as close
                            and dependent [on Thailand's part]<note n="5" xml:id="d47fn5">Brackets
                                in the source text.</note> as in the past. Some loosening of our
                            relationship would be healthy.</p>
                        <p>—In the process of moving to a more independent stance Thailand could
                            become less closely aligned with the U.S. and more involved with the
                            Soviets, which would not necessarily be an undesirable development. Thai
                            initiatives to the Soviet Union are viewed without alarm.</p>
                        <p>—If the Thai relations became less one-sided the Soviets might be willing
                            to contribute to multi-lateral institutions.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. should no longer expect the degree of exclusiveness in
                            U.S.-Thai relations that grew from the early cold war period and special
                            conditions of the Vietnam War. More flexibility in Thai foreign policy
                            is desirable.</p>
                        <p>Because you would not clear the message I have some indication that State
                            is making its views known to <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> via back channel messages. Under the

                        <p>After a few opening remarks, the Secretary asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> about conditions in Thailand,
                            remarking that he gathered the Thai are “worried” about their security.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> confirmed this,
                            indicating that they were worried mainly about U.S. congressional
                            attitudes which, they fear, might limit the Administration's ability to
                            fulfill U.S. commitments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary assured him that congressional actions and attitudes would
                            have no effect on U.S. treaty commitments. Even the Church Amendment was
                            not a restriction, the Secretary explained, because the Executive would
                            in any case seek congressional concurrence if it wanted to use combat
                            troops abroad. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked why in
                            that case the Church Amendment was necessary. The Secretary explained
                            that it was inspired by concern on the Hill about the war in Vietnam and
                            a feeling that President <persName>Johnson</persName> and Secretary Rusk
                            had misled the Congress as we became involved in that conflict,
                            specifically in their presentation of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. Now he
                            said they want to be sure that they are properly informed and
                            consulted.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then recalled that the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> Treaty contains a provision that in taking action the
                            signatories will follow their “constitutional processes,” to which
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> commented bitterly,
                            “Yes, an escape clause.” The Secretary continued that the Church
                            Amendment merely <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0158"/>reiterates the
                            Senate's expectation that constitutional processes will be
                                followed.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Telegram 19972 to Bangkok,

                                telegram 1333 from Bangkok (see <ref target="#d47fn2">footnotes 2</ref>
                                    and <ref target="#d47fn3">3</ref>, Document 47). It noted
                                that if “<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> and others
                                remain uneasy despite repeated assurances and explanations by the
                                most authoritative U.S. Govt. spokesmen, then we have little hope
                                that we could put their fears to rest by prefabricating new forensic
                                ammunition. On the contrary we conclude that Thai concern is based
                                largely upon their interpretation of the facts and we cannot deny
                                that the facts of their situation do indeed give them reason for
                                concern.” It continued that “we see no profit for either ourselves
                                or Thai in trying to gloss over the problem by proffering
                                unrealistic and inflated reassurrances. We cannot rid <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> observed that the Church
                            Amendment refers to introducing “ground combat troops” and noted that
                            the U.S. already has “troops” in Thailand. He wondered if those troops
                            had the right to defend themselves. The Secretary explained that from
                            our viewpoint the Church Amendment had no effect on the activities of
                            U.S. military personnel now in Thailand who will naturally be expected
                            to defend themselves if attacked. He said the amendment deals with a
                            possible land war in Asia and the possibility that we might become
                            involved in such a war without congressional approval. However, he
                            repeated we would seek congressional approval in any case, just as had
                            been done in Korea and as President <persName>Johnson</persName> thought
                            he had done in Vietnam through the Tonkin Gulf resolution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> remarked that the Thai do
                            not doubt the Administration's words in offering such reassurances but
                            that the words of Congress raise doubts. He said he understands there is
                            a struggle going on between Congress and the Executive for the control
                            of foreign policy. He thought this was exemplified in congressional
                            questioning about U.S. activities in Laos, adding that he thought
                            attacks on U.S. policy in Laos were really intended indirectly for
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that the real target is the Administration, that
                            congressional attacks represent a feeling that Congress has not been
                            adequately consulted and their determination that in the future they
                            will be consulted. He repeated the point that the Executive would, under
                            any circumstances, feel obliged to consult Congress on any measures that
                            might involve armed combat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked about the “secret
                            agreement” (Plan Taksin) and the <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            communiqué. What is the Administration's view on these? With regard to
                            the latter, the Secretary recalled that when he was in Bangkok last year
                            he reaffirmed the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> communiqué and added that
                            subsequent events had not in any way altered that position. As for the
                            “secret agreement”, he repeated the by-now-standard <pb n="110"
                                xml:id="pg_110" facs="0159"/>explanation that we regard this as a
                            contingency military plan which clearly provides that both governments
                            must approve before it can be put into effect. He said Congress had been
                            concerned because it thought it was a “secret treaty” but it is really
                            no more than a plan. (<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then
                            muttered, “Yes, like an executive agreement.”) The Secretary repeated
                            that the plan required agreement between the two governments before it
                            could be put into effect and that we thought of it as coming under the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty with its provision
                            for constitutional processes.</p>
                        <p>Later in the conversation, after other subjects had been discussed,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> reverted to his concern
                            about Congress, stating that his Prime Minister follows events on
                            Capitol Hill closely and is worried. He mentioned that Ambassador Unger
                            had given him (<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>) shortly
                            before he left Bangkok a useful memorandum on congressional developments
                            but said the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is not happy. He said,
                            “We want to establish squarely where responsibility lies.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that from our viewpoint there is no problem at
                            this time. He said that when he was in Bangkok last year there had been
                            a problem because of strong sentiment in the United States against our
                            Vietnam war policy, but that the situation was now quite different. He
                            cited a recent Gallup poll indicating that 64 percent of the people
                            favored the President's policy in Vietnam as compared with only 24
                            percent opposed. Previously he said there had been a problem of
                            congressional pressure on our Vietnam policy but this was no longer
                            serious except to the extent that it caused the Thai to be disturbed and
                            fearful that we might disengage from the region. He elaborated on the
                            point by comparing U.S. sentiment which had compelled President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> to decide against seeking reelection
                            with the relative lack of interest in Vietnam today.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed confidence that there is general public
                            acceptance today of the President's policy, of which key elements are
                            that we will not disengage from our responsibilities in Asia but will
                            phase down our presence at a rate geared to the ability of local
                            governments to take over. He mentioned as an example that we now have
                            many troops in Korea but that, in due course, we will probably want to
                            reduce them gradually, though not to withdraw them entirely. In any
                            case, he said, we will not disengage or renege on our treaty
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> commented that the Thai for
                            their part would also keep their promise not to call on outside manpower
                            to help them with their internal insurgency problem, though they will
                            appreciate continuing U.S. assistance.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary asked how the Thai view things in Laos. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> responded that they were worried
                            and that just before he left Bangkok there had been several Security
                            Council meetings on the subject. He said they are not sure of Communist
                            intentions. Possibly the Communists merely intend to secure the Ho Chi
                            Minh Trail, but there are other indications that they may also have
                            designs on Thailand. He cited the Chinese road. (He noted as a “nuance”
                            that in the construction, after a certain village had been reached—he
                            could not recall the name—the Chinese no longer used Chinese personnel
                            but only Pathet Lao or North Vietnamese.) He said the Thai fear that the
                            road is being constructed to serve potentially as another “Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail” if the Chinese choose to move against Thailand in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that since his last conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> the war in Vietnam had been going
                            worse for the North Vietnamese and that both infiltration and the
                            intensity of combat were considerably reduced. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> observed that this was offset by
                            increased Communist efforts in Laos. He added that there was also
                            increased guerilla infiltration into Thailand. He said his Prime
                            Minister was much concerned and had asked him specifically to express
                            his concern to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said the Thai would be
                            willing to help the effort in Laos by operating helicopter gunships and
                            added that the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would also like them
                            to do this. He said the Thai had trained personnel to operate them but
                            would need help. He indicated vaguely that they might require additional
                            helicopters (though he may have been referring to equipment needed to
                            convert existing helicopters to gunships).</p>

                        <p>This is a reduction from our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969
                            obligations of $35.5 million and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                            obligations of $46.7 million. The reduction adds to Thai doubts about
                            U.S. interest in them. State feels that the Thais understand that the
                            reduction is due to Congressional cuts in <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> appropriations and a shortage of projects, so the
                            adverse political reactions can be minimized.</p>
                        <p>The program's primary objective is to help preserve the security of
                            Thailand, partly by inducing the Thais to allocate more resources to
                            their own security programs. Our program concentrates on providing
                            advisory and financial support to the Thai police, and assisting in
                            development programs, to try to prevent the growth of Communist
                            insurgency in the North and Northeast.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the program provides:</p>
                        <p>—$7 million for a public safety program, to help develop a security
                            capacity sufficient to counter the growth of Communist insurgency in the
                            rural areas.</p>
                        <p>—$9 million for the accelerated rural development program, which
                            emphasizes road construction and other projects aimed at increasing the
                            Government's responsiveness to village needs.</p>
                        <p>—$14 million to help increase support for the Thai Government in the
                            North and Northeast, by helping their programs in health, education,
                            agriculture and public administration.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the bilateral program proposed in State's memorandum,
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> conducts a $14 million East Asia
                            Regional Program, roughly half of which benefits Thailand. The regional
                            program is growing <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0162"/>in
                            importance and could expand rapidly if its support for Mekong River
                            Basin projects moves beyond the feasibility study phase.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 51 study of Thailand, now in
                            the final stages of preparation, will address the major options open to
                            the U.S. in our overall relations with Thailand. Issues which will be
                            considered in that study are, inter alia:</p>
                        <p>—Have we overemphasized quick-impact counter-insurgency programs at the
                            expense of longer-term development programs?</p>
                        <p>—Have we pushed the Thais into programs which they feel are of low
                            priority, and will be discontinued by the Thais after U.S. inputs are
                            withdrawn?</p>
                        <p>—Can the Thais take full responsibility for their public safety program
                            and their accelerated rural development program?</p>
                        <p>Your approval of the recommended program for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1970 will not prejudge these decisions for <gloss

                            covered the military situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
                            status of pacification, our views of Hanoi's post-hostilities planning
                            and the Vietnamization program, including a word about its relation to
                            third country forces.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> was very interested and brought
                            up several points the most important of which concerned Vietnamization.
                            He pointedly asked whether the U.S. was training and equipping the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> to replace U.S. forces only
                            or whether we also planned to replace Thai and other allied forces. I
                            explained to him that for the purposes of the Vietnamization program we
                            were now discussing the revitalized <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            forces were intended to replace a substantial share of U.S. forces in

                            assumed their eventually replacing <gloss target="#t_FWF1">FWF</gloss>
                            was also contemplated. (I had already said that some U.S. troops which
                            would be remaining in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> through the
                            Vietnamization process would continue to provide the Black Panthers with
                            the various kinds of support from U.S. forces they are receiving today;
                            my comment was based on my discussions last week in Saigon.) He
                            responded that he had been under considerable pressure from Parliament
                            to withdraw Thai forces from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in face
                            of continued U.S. and allied reductions. In response to my direct
                            question on whether it was his feeling that he would be obliged to carry
                            our reductions, he did not say he intended to reduce the Thai troop
                            contributions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, but again stressed
                            that he was under growing pressure from the representatives in
                            Parliament and said that “when the people feel very strongly about a
                            situation, the government must do something to ease that situation.”</p>

                        <p>3. I replied that I was aware of and sympathetic to his problem. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had warmly appreciated his
                            statement that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> intended to
                            maintain the Thai forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> as long
                            as the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> needs them or until Thailand
                            itself requires those forces. I added that my government hoped the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> would retain all of the Thai
                            forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, or at least a substantial
                            part of them, at least during the Vietnamization process. I had already
                            emphasized, however, that the Vietnamization program did not have a
                            specific schedule for completion but its rate depended upon intensity of
                            enemy activity on the battlefield, the capacity of the Vietnamese to
                            take over the combat role and progress in Paris, if any. I then pointed
                            out the psychological and political importance of having not only U.S.
                            forces but Thai and other allied forces as well to support the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> during the period of its takeover of
                            the combat responsibility. I also pointed out the importance of the Thai
                            forces in protecting the eastern and southeastern approaches to Saigon
                            and thus freeing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, as
                            Vietnamization proceeds to establish a stronger Vietnamese military
                            presence in remote areas along the Cambodian border. I requested that,
                            if at any time he felt he had to decide to withdraw some of the Thai
                            forces, I be given the opportunity to discuss his plans with him before
                            he takes any action. He said that he would discuss such plans with the
                            cabinet, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and indicated that I would
                            also have an opportunity to talk with him.</p>
                        <p>4. In connection with Vietnamization I told the <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss> that the U.S. forces in Thailand might have some
                            additional functions to perform here because some of the combat support
                            activities now being con-ducted in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            such as air defense, air interdiction and reconnaissance might, as
                            Vietnamization proceeds, have to be continued from outside <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, e.g., Thailand and elsewhere. I added
                            that while there appeared to be a continuing need to have U.S. forces
                            and personnel in Thailand to support the <gloss target="#t_VN1"
                                >VN</gloss> effort until Vietnamization is well down the road, I did
                            not believe this ruled out a continuation of the gradual reduction of
                            U.S. forces in Thailand which we and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> had jointly got underway last September. I speculated
                            that we might have a follow-on reduction to the present one in the next
                            fiscal year which would reduce our forces by about the same magnitude
                            and that I would consult with the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> as
                            our plans developed. He acknowledged these points without comment.</p>
                        <p>5. Comment. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> carefully avoided
                            saying that he would at some point have to withdraw all or part of the
                            Thai forces. However, it was clear that he wished to register the point
                            of Parliamentary pres-sure and I did not press the matter beyond making
                            clear our interest in maintaining Thai forces and in being consulted
                            about any reduction plans. I believe that in sharing with the <gloss

                            weigh heavily on his mind we have restored some <pb n="116"

                            will have made available to me timely information with which to continue
                            such exchanges of information on matters of importance to the Thai,
                            which also give us an opportunity to gain valuable insights into their

                        <p>In February 1970, North Vietnam began an offensive in Laos which caused
                            great concern to both the Thai and U.S. Governments. The Washington
                            Special Actions Group (<gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>) began a

                        <p>One of the key issues discussed by the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> was the question of whether Thai troops should
                            reinforce friendly troops in the Long Tieng and other areas of Laos. In
                            the March 19 <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting, the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s briefing officer, [<hi rend="italic"
                                >name not declassified</hi>], noted that “the recently deployed
                                <gloss target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1">Sierra Romeo</gloss> IX Thai
                            artillery battalion” was among friendly forces at Long Tieng facing
                            severe North Vietnamese pressure. Assistant to the President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> wondered about the
                            consequences if any of the Thai were captured by the North Vietnamese.
                            The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Deputy Director for Plans,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Thomas H. Karamessines</persName>, said
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], “but that there
                            certainly might be problems if some of them were captured.” In response
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s question about
                            what further forces could be put into the defense of Long Tieng, <gloss

                                Johnson</persName> mentioned a Thai regimental combat team (<gloss

                            Ambassador to Laos, G. McMurtrie Godley. However, Johnson noted that
                            neither the Thai nor the Lao Governments had yet approached the United
                            States about that step. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                                >Green</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_RCT1"
                                >RCT</gloss> in question was the one designated in the Taksin Plan,
                            “and its employment might raise the question of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> action under the plan. He noted that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> thought that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> would not be suitable for anti-guerilla
                            operations.” In response to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>'s asking whether anyone favored using Thai
                            troops, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JVANC1">Nels Johnson</persName>
                            said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> thought that the
                            possibility should be explored. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                                >Green</persName> said that the North Vietnamese might retaliate
                            against the Thais if the Thais became more involved in Laos. When
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if the
                            introduction of Thai troops at this time would restrain the North
                            Vietnamese, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> replied that on
                            the contrary, the <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0166"/>North
                            Vietnamese “would very much like to give the Thais a beating, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName> agreed.” When
                            Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> circulated a draft <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> cable calling for the transfer of the

                            Vietnam to Laos, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> objected
                            that the Thai unit in South Vietnam was made up of volunteers who were
                            entitled to discharge if withdrawn from Vietnam. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> added that it was “highly

                                <persName>Johnson</persName> raised the question of briefing

                            operation, but <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said
                            that this should not be done yet. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> cautioned that the United States did not want
                            a Thai debacle at Long Tieng. His final comment was that he would
                            discuss the use of additional Thai forces with the President. (National

                        <p>Dear Mr. Foreign Minister:</p>
                        <p>My colleagues and I have had an opportunity to study your letter of March
                            22.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>You can rest assured that we are deeply concerned about recent
                            developments in Laos and we appreciate the Thai wish to accede to the
                            Royal Lao Government's appeal by dispatching an infantry battalion and
                            possibly other units as well if future needs should dictate. We fully
                            recognize the danger that Communist advances in Laos could ultimately
                            pose to the security of Thailand which is, of course, a matter of
                            highest importance to the United States. It is for this reason that we
                            have recently taken the air actions of which I informed you yesterday as
                            well as other steps designed to bring home to Hanoi the seriousness of
                            our view of its actions.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, we are not convinced that the proposed deployment of Thai
                            troops additional to those now serving in Laos with the <gloss
                                target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1">Sierra Romeo</gloss> artillery battery
                            would be effective at this time. It is our current assessment that the
                            fate of Long Tieng is not likely to be decided by introduction of such
                            additional ground troops. Perhaps the best move that could be made at
                            this time would be for you to assemble these battalions into an <gloss
                                target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> at an advanced base (i.e., Udorn) and
                            see that it is trained and readied against the contingency of further
                            moves the North Vietnamese may make.</p>
                        <p>In expressing this judgment, I do not wish to imply in any way that, from
                            a military viewpoint, Thai contributions to the Laos struggle have not
                            been or will not continue to be extremely valuable. The Thai artillery
                            battery now at Long Tieng has, according to our reports, been performing
                            extremely well and may be given a large part of the credit for the fact
                            that that outpost is still in Lao Government hands. We are also
                            conscious that your Government's contributions, through your advisors in
                            Laos, have been most important in improving the capability of the Lao
                            Government forces. Our decision with respect to the proposed additional
                            deployment of infantry is based upon our judgment that at this time, the
                            risks and costs of this move would not be justified by the prospects of
                            military success.</p>
                        <p>The President hopes that our two Governments will continue to maintain
                            the closest contact with each other and with the Royal Lao Government on
                            developments in Laos and on possible military and political means to
                            stabilize the situation.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards,</p>

                            1) acceding to the Thai and Lao request by introducing the Thai

                            agreeing to move the Thai battalion in and providing pay and allowances,

                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked what
                            advantage there would be in declaring the Thai presence,
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that “there would be an
                            advantage in the U.S. showing that we were not continuing to fight a
                            secret war, but rather that the Thais felt strongly enough to take a
                            clear stand.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then
                            asked if the Thais would be willing to declare their forces.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> responded that this remained to be
                            seen, stating that with respect to Long Tieng, the Thais were reluctant,
                            “but if the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> crossed the border, he
                            didn't see how they could be expected to act in any other way.” General

                            replied that “the troops would be in place 36 hours after approval is

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then advanced two
                            options: option 1 was an airlift of a Thai battalion of 600 men to Long
                            Tieng, and option 2 was a commitment to <persName corresp="#p_SP2"

                            detailed explanation of the pros and cons of each option.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that “The
                            President's preference [for putting Thai troops in Laos] has not
                            abated.” <persName>Johnson</persName> warned against building up Long
                            Tieng into “a turning point of the struggle in Laos” and against the
                            “Dienbienphu factor.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            stated that the President wanted to know whether, “if we move in a Thai
                            battalion, the enemy could then isolate it.” General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> replied: “Sure they could but
                            it would be a difficult operation. I don't think the Meo and Thai would
                            sit in Long Tieng for a long siege. They would just fade into the
                            bush.”</p>
                        <p>In weighing option 2, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            noted that if Long Tieng fell the North Vietnamese would have moved
                            closer to the Thai border, the effectiveness of the Lao forces would be
                            less, “our commitment would be greater,” and that it “would be difficult
                            to avoid linkage to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and Plan

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] He added that the “Thais
                            want to involve us. They consider that U.S. involvement is tantamount to
                            victory.”</p>

                            by stating that the President wanted to make a decision by noon and that
                            he was leaning toward option 1, moving the Thai battalion to Long Tieng
                            as soon as possible. In response to <persName corresp="#p_CLGRE1"

                            developed:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Option 1:</hi> We could quickly flesh out the
                            equipment needs of a Thai battalion (about 900 men) now located at Udorn
                            Air Base and airlift it to Long Thien. This could be accomplished in
                            about 72–96 hours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Pro:</hi> If this unit is put into position before an
                            all-out attack by North Vietnamese forces it would increase the
                            probability of holding Long Thien against the forces now deployed
                            against it. But it would not assure that the position could be held. It
                            would delay the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> forces, however, at
                            least for the time they would need to move forward the division now held
                            in reserve 40 miles away. It would boost the morale of <persName
                                corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> and his Meo forces and toughen
                            their resistance. It would stabilize <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                                >Souvanna</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> for the time being and reduce the risk of the
                            whole situation unraveling. The chances for an organized retreat should
                            that become necessary, and thus the saving of those forces, would be
                            increased. Moreover, this action would be a clear signal to North
                            Vietnam that we would not let a major threat to Laotian sovereignty go
                            unchallenged. This response also would strengthen <persName
                                corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName>'s hand against those rightist
                            elements who seek his removal and whose succession could complicate our

                            <hi rend="italic">Con:</hi> On the other hand, Long Thien might fall
                            despite the introduction of the Thai unit. We could face the same
                            dilemmas compounded by an additional commitment especially if the
                            retreat is not orderly. We would also face a strong domestic outcry
                            which could result in increased inhibitions on our air operations in
                            Laos. If the Thai battalion were lost in the action, it could be a
                            serious blow to Thai morale.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Option 2:</hi> We could tell <persName

                                >Thanat</persName> that the best way to use Thai forces would be to
                            prepare a full regiment of three battalions for introduction at a later
                            stage should North Vietnam take Long Thien and continue to move
                            southward. We would commit ourselves to proceed on this course if the
                            need were to arise. We would consult with them now on how to equip and
                            train the unit readying it for use when the time came and decide on a
                            place for putting it.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Pro:</hi> This course would avoid the danger of a
                            disaster involving substantial Thai forces at Long Thien (although over
                            300 Thais are already there with an artillery unit). We would be giving
                            a favorable response to the urgent plea of <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                                >Souvanna</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>. The domestic political problem would be somewhat
                            reduced—we could point to the fact that we had waited until North
                            Vietnamese intentions to overrun Laos had become unambiguous and that we
                            had shown great restraint in the face of earlier strong pleas for our
                            help. Since it is not certain that North Vietnam intends to move much
                            beyond Long Thien, we might not have to move the Thais at all.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Con:</hi> This response is less than <persName

                            him from stampeding—and seeking a deal with North Vietnam in the belief
                            that we are not prepared to support him. Moreover, by waiting we may be
                            in a worse position when and if we have to move the Thai forces. The
                            North Vietnamese would have moved closer to the Thai border,
                            effectiveness of the Lao forces would be less and our commitment would
                            be greater. Moreover, it would be harder in those circumstances to avoid

                            orderly retreat from Long Tieng, if necessary, is considered preferable
                            to encirclement.</p>

                            that a regimental combat team be assembled. We will not make any U.S.
                            commitment to provide support for this regimental combat team or for its
                            employment.</p>
                        <p>b. The message to <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> will
                            take the form of a letter from the President. It will note the need for
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> to make a formal
                            request to the Thai Government for the battalion. However, preparations
                            to move the battalion will not be delayed awaiting confirmation that a
                            Lao request has been transmitted to the Thais.</p>
                        <p>4. Our public position, on an if-asked basis, will be the same as that
                            already taken on <gloss target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1">Sierra Romeo</gloss>,
                            namely, that reports of movement of Thai troops to Laos are exaggerated
                            and that the question is one for the Thai and Lao Governments, to whom
                            inquiries should be directed. We will ask the Thai and Lao Governments
                            to adopt a position of no <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0175"
                            />comment in response to inquiries. We will urge the Thai and Lao
                            Governments not to deny that additional Thai troops have been sent to
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. It was the consensus of the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> that
                            the Administration should take the initiative in informing the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee of the movement of the Thai Battalion to
                            Laos. The <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> recommended that the
                            Committee be told that in response to requests from the Governments of
                            Thailand and Laos, we are assisting with the movement of a few hundred
                            more Thai troops to Laos. The new movement should be explained as an
                            extension of the <gloss target="#t_SIERRAROMEO1">Sierra Romeo</gloss>
                            program about which the Committee has already been informed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will seek the views
                            of Bryce Harlow and will ask the President's approval of the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> proposal.</p>
                        <p>6. All operational communications involving the movement of the Thai
                            battalion are to be handled through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            channels. Other communications are to be transmitted through the most
                            secure channels. Knowledge of the movement is to be restricted within
                            each agency.</p>
                        <p>7. The letters which the President has already approved to signatories of
                            the Geneva Convention other than Great Britain and the Soviet Union are
                            to be dispatched.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">See ibid., <ref

                        <p>In the <hi rend="italic">short term</hi>, the Thai can help the Lon Nol
                            Government by:</p>
                        <p>—Issuing a statement recognizing the Cambodian border along the present
                            frontiers. This is something which <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                                >Sihanouk</persName> never got from the Thai, and issuance of such a
                            statement now might help to give the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName> Government extra credit in the eyes of the Cambodian
                            people. The Cambodians have long wanted the Thai to accept the existing
                            frontiers, since Thailand has maintained a traditional claim to large
                            areas of Western Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>—Getting the word to the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>
                            Government that Thailand has no intention of causing any military
                            problems for Cambodia along the Thai-Cambodian frontiers. This would
                            permit the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> Government to
                            shift military forces from the Thai borders to more critical areas in
                            Eastern and Northeastern Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>—Backing up Cambodian political and diplomatic initiatives, e.g.
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the
                            Cambodian situation if Cambodia wants this, and helping out where
                            possible to bring about reactivation of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1"
                                >ICC</gloss> in Cambodia. Thai help in this sphere would be most
                            useful if other Asian nations without too close ties to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> (for example Indonesia and Singapore)
                            were also in the act.</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0177"/>
                        <p>Over the longer term, Thailand might provide additional help by:</p>
                        <p>—Offering military aid to Cambodia. Cambodia still possesses sizeable
                            stocks of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-supplied weapons, and the
                            Thail might be able to provide (or act as a transit point for)
                            ammunition, spare parts, and additional arms in the event that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> Government finds it
                            necessary to draw upon its US-supplied stocks to supplement the
                            Communist arms with which the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FARK</gloss> is
                            now mostly equipped. Conceivably, Thai <gloss target="#t_LOC1"
                                >LOC</gloss>s to Cambodia could become very important in sustaining
                            the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> Government.</p>
                        <p>—Once a sufficiently large number of other nations have recognized the
                                <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> Government, extending
                            Thai diplomatic recognition. <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName> will probably need all the international backing he
                            can get, but it would be unwise for Thailand to act too soon because of
                            Thailand's close association with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            and the desirability of keeping <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName>'s neutral credentials intact.</p>
                        <p>The Thai may already be thinking of taking some of the above steps, both
                            short and longer-term, but could be stimulated into focussing more
                            closely on possible actions through conversations with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> and others on his
                            staff.</p>
                        <p>One step which I would not recommend would be introducing Thai troops
                            into Cambodia. From our Laos exercise, we know that trained Thai troops
                            are in any event hard to come by and might not be particularly helpful
                            if the Lon Nol Government were attacked by <gloss target="#t_NVA1"
                                >NVA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces. In addition,
                            in view of Thailand's territorial claims, the presence of Thai troops on
                            Cambodian soil would probably not be welcomed by the Cambodian people or
                            could play into <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s hands.
                            Finally, we would have the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            commitment to worry about if Thai troops were introduced into
                            Cambodia.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> discussed the pros and cons of
                            responding to <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName>'s request
                            for an additional Thai battalion. The principal arguments put forth in
                            favor were that the battalion would strengthen the defensive situation
                            and that it would deter the North Vietnamese from advancing further
                            along Routes 7 and 13. The principal arguments cited against were that
                            the presence of additional Thai troops might increase the incentive to
                            the North Vietnamese to attack, that the Thai commitment to a
                            conventional role in Laos would be increased at the expense of
                            counterinsurgency activities within Thailand, that the Chinese might be
                            led to step up their support for insurgency in northeast Thailand, and
                            that the Thais might request additional military assistance from the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> members noted the lack of Congressional and public
                            reaction to the earlier introduction of a Thai battalion.</p>
                        <p>It was the consensus that the Thais would be willing to make another
                            battalion available in return for the same sort of <gloss

                                the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> was informed at that time
                                of “the President's decision to go forward with moving a second Thai
                                battalion to Laos.” The summary stated the movement would be
                                “arranged on the same basis and according to the same procedures as

                                of March 26, 1970 to govern meeting of the first Thai battalion.” It
                                also added that the press guidance for the movement and the need for
                                a contingency plan for orderly withdrawal would remain the same.

                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>I deeply appreciated your letter of March 27, with which you enclosed the
                            text of your statement before the House Sub-Committee on Defense
                            Appropriations. I have reviewed this very significant document and I
                            noted particularly the emphasis which you placed upon the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. As you know, the Thai
                            have fully endorsed the Guam Doctrine. They have repeatedly stressed the
                            identity of their and our views that U.S. forces should not become
                            involved in Thailand's internal security operations. They have also
                            stressed the very point you made in your presentation, namely, the need
                            to obtain critical resources and skills to do the job themselves. The
                            Thai attitude can be illustrated by reference to three specific points
                            which are currently active issues, i.e. military assistance, Laos and
                            U.S. force reductions. These points and some others that are also
                            relevant are discussed in greater detail in a memorandum attached to
                            this letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">A more detailed analysis of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s reduction
                                recommendations, summarized in an April 29 memorandum from the
                                Embassy's Political-Military Counselor, George F. Muller, to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, is attached but
                                not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>U.S. military assistance is regarded by the Thai as a key measure of the
                            meaning of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine.
                            Unfortunately, military assistance is declining. Viewed in isolation the
                            projected downward trend for Thailand would probably not be
                            unmanageable, but the Thai will regard it as only one among several
                            recent developments that have produced a sense of uncertainty about our
                            future intentions. I was encouraged, however, by your remarks in the
                            March 27 letter about the importance of improved training and sales
                            programs. We are making certain recommendations regarding intensified
                            training and the Thai are interested in increased military sales.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Laos, it is obvious from the map, why the Thai regard the
                            situation there as being even more directly related to their own
                            security than the situation in Viet-Nam. You are familiar with the
                            rather considerable commitment Thailand has already made in cooperation
                            with us to support the neutral Government of Laos. We are considering
                            ways in which that support may be expanded. From the Thai point of view
                            a Viet-Nam settlement which does not include a satisfactory
                            stabilization in Laos would leave them under a very grave <pb n="131"

                                stepped up their infiltration and occupation of the part of Cambodia
                                that bordered South Vietnam and, in response, U.S. and South

                            would apply to that country. Accordingly, the Thai have been gratified
                            and encouraged by the strong actions and position announced by the
                            President in his statement of April 30.</p>
                        <p>The reduction of U.S. forces in Thailand is inseparable from the Laos
                            question. It is for this reason that I take this opportunity to express
                            to you personally my grave reservations regarding the impact of the
                            10,000-man force reduction which is now under consideration in
                                Washington.<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">The Thai reduction package

                            The removal of seven out of 15 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            squadrons, three of <gloss target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss>s and four of
                                <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105s, would necessarily gravely
                            weaken our capability in Laos and, accordingly, the capability of the
                            Lao forces to resist. As seen in Thailand, it would comparably increase
                            the threat to Thailand's security. The Thai expect us to propose a new
                            force reduction and I believe that a reduction of approximately the size
                            of the last one, 6,000 men, could be managed without either cutting too
                            deeply into the Air Force muscle required for Laos, or arousing acute
                            Thai concern over a too rapid withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the projected Vietnamization program requires the
                            continued availability of Thai bases and facilities as well as Thai
                            forces in South Viet-Nam well into 1973, if not beyond. I don't think we
                            will have any difficulty retaining the use of these facilities if we
                            maintain Thai confidence in our intentions as manifested in military
                            assistance under the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            Doctrine, our firmness in Laos, and the utilization of U.S. military
                            facilities in Thailand. A further point which is most germane you
                            yourself made very clearly on page 29 of your summary when you
                            emphasized the need to maintain the confidence of our allies that we do
                            not intend to renounce our long-standing obligations here. It is because
                            of the close relationship between the success of the Vietnamization
                            program and the availability of Thailand facilities over the next few
                            years that I have taken this opportunity to emphasize the foregoing
                            points. I appreciate the political and budgetary pressures at home and I
                            assure you that we will do our utmost, given the situation in Thailand,
                            to assist in the success of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>4. We concur (para 5) in keeping communications on two regiments in this

                            their property need not be protected, use of U.S.-supplied or funded
                            equipment for the two regiments should be protected on a closely held
                            basis. Provision by Thais of U.S. supplied equipment for any other
                            projects must also be carefully protected.</p>
                        <p>6. In regard second para reftel numbered 6 (number duplicated), we would
                            expect to furnish initial equipment for the two regiments from three to
                            four 1000-man packs of arms, ammo and communications equipment which we
                            have allotted for Cambodian assistance. Uniforms would be required. We
                            would hope to provide uniforms from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                            stocks in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> which would be moved [<hi

                            to training sites to avoid any major draw down of <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> stocks in Thailand. We do not believe
                            this project could be kept covert if <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                            stocks in Thailand are used. We expect [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>] covertly to fund for both
                            regiments during period of training in Thailand, costs of food, housing
                            and training, and following training to fund transportation to Cambodia.
                            While in Thailand, Cambodian regiment will be paid covertly [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>], but we would expect Thais to assume responsibility
                            for paying their regiment during training period. In Cambodia,
                            ammunition and some replacement of original equipment will be required
                            and we are planning to do this under same arrangement we have made for
                            support of Khmer Krom troops now in Cambodia, i.e., from <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> stocks in <gloss target="#t_RVN1"
                                >RVN</gloss> using South Vietnamese military transportation and
                            delivered to <gloss target="#t_FANK1">FANK</gloss>. After arrival in
                            Cambodia, pay, food and housing for Cambodian regiment would become
                            responsibility of <gloss target="#t_FANK1">FANK</gloss>. Thai regiment
                            presents special problem. We are proceeding on assumption that Thais
                            will take direct responsibility for pay, food and housing for their
                            regiment [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. It is essential that (a) both regiments
                            (officers and men) be composed entirely of or, in Thai regiment, almost
                            entirely of ethnic Khmer troops and (b) follow same process as have
                            Khmer Krom of being folded into <gloss target="#t_FANK1">FANK</gloss>.
                            Press and public seem to have accepted return of Khmer Krom to fight in
                            Cambodia as natural and normal state of affairs. We realize Thais may
                            have a different concept of operations for their regiment and need more
                            information on Thai plans before we can make final commitment on this
                            half of project.</p>
                        <p>7. On questions para 7, we are and will keep aware of what others may do
                            to assist Cambodians. Question on supply while in Cambodia answered para
                            6 above.</p>
                        <p>8. Regarding para 9, question A, we have a Presidential determination
                            establishing a small (7.9 million dollars) <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> program for Cambodia. This determination permits use of
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> stocks in <gloss
                                target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> or those in possession of <gloss

                            which will then be replaced (unless <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135"
                                facs="0184"/>equipment is excess of U.S., Thai or Vietnamese
                            requirements) from Cambodian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds
                            of $7.9 million. We would hope to avoid any major use of <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                            stocks in Thailand for reason stated para 6 above.</p>
                        <p>9. In response to para 9, question B, we wish to make it completely clear
                            to Thais that the two regiments cannot become a U.S. responsibility in
                            event they get into a situation in Cambodia like that faced by <gloss
                                target="#t_SR1">SR</gloss> VIII last June in Laos. As is case for
                            other <gloss target="#t_FANK1">FANK</gloss> units, U.S. ground forces
                            could not be committed to assist them; and it should not be assumed
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> air support would be
                            available. You should make clear to <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            that our support for this project does not carry any implication of a
                            decision on our part to commit U.S. forces to Cambodia or Thailand.</p>

                            SecDef memorandum, the problem is a complex one with important political
                            implications that must be fully considered, particularly because of the
                            likelihood of base closures and significant force readjustments.</p>

                        <p>Because U.S. troop withdrawals are of most serious concern to the Royal
                            Thai Government, it is important that the foreign policy implications be
                            fully taken into account. In addition, we must be mindful of the
                            necessity in any planning we do, to provide adequate time for genuine
                            consultations with the Royal Thai Government (anticipated to take about
                            60 days minimum) on any U.S. troop withdrawals we may desire to
                            undertake. Some of the questions which will undoubtedly arise during
                            discussions with the Thai are outlined in the attachment. With these in
                            mind, I suggest we ask our staffs to review together the troop
                            withdrawal proposals so that foreign policy problems can be resolved
                            prior to consultations with the Royal Thai Government.<note n="4"

                        </p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> asked to see me on urgent
                            basis this afternoon. As anticipated, he wanted above all to discuss
                            support arrangements for Thai <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0186"
                            />forces that might go to Cambodia. Present at our discussion also were
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> and General
                            Prasert, Deputy Commander AFSC. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                                >Dawee</persName> said that after the Prime Minister had received
                            another urgent letter for help from <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName> both the Cabinet and the Security Council had again
                            discussed this issue. The Thai were prepared to send two regiments
                            (3,600 men) of [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>], but could do so only on the basis of support
                            arrangements similar to those made for the three battalions in Laos. He
                            said, “If you cannot help Cambodia directly, help us to help them.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> stressed the importance
                            of holding Cambodia and that the situation there required immediate
                            deployment of Thai forces; there was no time to await completion of a
                            training program as previously discussed. Yem Sambour is still in town
                            and he will meet again with Deputy PriMin <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                                >Praphat</persName> tomorrow. Next week <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                                >Praphat</persName> and a Thai delegation including <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> and Chairatana will leave for
                            Phnom Penh to conduct further discussions on Thai assistance.</p>
                        <p>2. Agreeing with him on the importance of assisting Cambodia, I went into
                            the basic differences between the situation in Cambodia and that in Laos
                            and Viet-Nam and explained Washington's thinking about support
                            arrangements in terms of para 6, reftel. I stressed that we would help
                            out with training and equipment while the forces were still in Thailand,
                            but once they went into Cambodia we could no longer support their
                            subsistence the way we do in Viet-Nam or Laos. We do not and will not
                            have the means we have in both of those places to set up direct supply
                            channels for Thai personnel. Dawee accepted this but retorted that if we
                            don't find some means to help the Thai with the financial burden of
                            supporting the forces, there would be no chance of sending any Thai
                            forces to Cambodia; Thailand has the men, but needs matériel assistance.
                            He confirmed that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> would pay
                            basic pay, but would look to us for payment of subsistence and other
                            allowances, various benefits, as well as for matériel and equipment. He
                            said the reason they were thinking in terms of the same support
                            arrangements as in Laos was that they would not send regular troops, but
                                [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. In
                            this manner, the question of budgetary support would not come to public
                            attention. He felt this was politically the most acceptable arrangement
                            for us and would not stir up trouble in the U.S. such as charges about
                            Thailand and/or <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> trying to
                            involve the U.S. a la Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. The forces provided by Thailand could be immediately used to stabilize
                            the situation around Phnom Penh, and generally along the route from
                            Thailand as, for example, around Kompong Thom; perhaps also on the west
                            bank of the Mekong. He also said it was important to destroy enemy
                            forces in the border triangle of Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. After the
                            forces drawn from the Khmer Serei and other Cambodian groups had had
                            their training (in about 3–4 months) they could <pb n="138"
                                xml:id="pg_138" facs="0187"/>be rotated in to replace the [<hi

                            Thai forces. The latter can be phased in one battalion at a time,
                            beginning practically immediately.</p>
                        <p>4. In a separate development, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote
                                Sarasin</persName> asked [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] to call on him this morning in
                            order to urge U.S. reconsideration of decision re non-support for Thai
                            troops once deployed in Cambodia. Pote pointed out that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> intends to commit all the help to
                            Cambodia that it can from its own resources and that the National
                            Security Council had allocated 20 million baht to provide the kinds of
                            finished goods which can be produced in Thailand such as shoes,
                            uniforms, mosquito nets, and canteens. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss>, however, needs U.S. assistance of the kind provided in
                            Laos for Thai regiments in Cambodia and, in any case, could not fund
                            such support from the Thai budget, even if it were able, without the
                            knowledge of parliamentary reviewing committees and the consequent
                            exposure of the covert nature of the effort. He pointed out that with
                            U.S. assistance the Thais can maintain a credible cover story, if the
                            presence of Thai troops in Cambodia subsequently comes to public
                            attention, by claiming that these Thais are volunteers who are fighting
                            with the Cambodian Army. Finally, Pote cited the contributions Thailand
                            is now making to support free world efforts to resist aggression in
                            Vietnam, Laos, and now Cambodia as evidence of <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> commitment to participate fully in this effort within
                            the limits of its means.</p>
                        <p>5. To summarize, the Thais have undertaken to make two regiments of total
                            of 3,600 men available as rapidly as possible in response to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>'s urgent request. To the maximum
                            extent possible, these troops will be familiar with the Cambodian
                            language [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. In the meantime, the Thais are proceeding to
                            recruit former Khmer Serei and other Cambodian-speaking men on both
                            sides of the Thai/Cambodian border. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] has independent confirmation
                            that this recruitment is proceeding. When these troops trained they can
                            be rotated to replace the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] Thai forces.</p>
                        <p>6. It seems to me that we should agree to pay such allowances as we are
                            now paying the battalions in Laos in addition to the training expenses
                            which you have authorized in reftel. These include subsistence, combat
                            allowance, and death and disability payments. I have made it clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> that we cannot provide
                            subsistence in kind as in Vietnam. It seems to me, therefore, that a
                            monthly sum based on a daily baht rate should be negotiated as a
                            reimbursement for the outlay the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            will have to make. I think it is clear from the reasons which have been
                            cited by <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> and also by
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> that the Thais are
                            unlikely to feel able to respond to <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName>'s urgent request for these troops unless arrangements
                            similar to those in Laos can be worked out. I am satisfied <pb n="139"
                                xml:id="pg_139" facs="0188"/>that Thais do intend and have already
                            started providing significant assistance to the Cambodians from their
                            own resources, namely finished goods which can be produced here. They
                            are also ready to continue the basic pay for the [<hi rend="italic">less

                        <p>7. I urge therefore that you give this matter urgent and favorable

                            in Bangkok we have received a number of reports covering actions which
                            the Thai are planning to take on Cambodia. These are:</p>
                        <p>—The Thai Cabinet has agreed to send two regiments to Vietnam for
                            augmentation of the Black Panthers, and the commitment of Black Panther
                            units inside Cambodia in the sanctuary area. These will go probably a
                            battalion at a time.</p>
                        <p>—The decision has been made to proceed with the recruiting and training
                            of two Thai ethnic Khmer regiments, with U.S. support. These will be
                            trained in Thailand by battalions, and the process might take 8–16
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>—The Thai will train 8 Cambodian pilots (but characteristically want us
                            to pay).</p>
                        <p>—The Thai will also train regular Cambodian Army and Navy personnel.</p>
                        <p>—The question of giving Cambodian forces Thai Air Force support is being
                            looked into. The Thai are also considering using the <gloss

                        <p>—Furnishing trucks. They want us to provide 30–50 and are unwilling to

                        <p>Dear Alex:</p>
                        <p>This responds to your letter of May 21<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">
                                <ref target="#d65">Document 65</ref>.</note> regarding troop
                            withdrawals from Thailand.</p>
                        <p>As you probably know the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 Department
                            of Defense budget is facing serious pressure from both the Congress and
                            inflation. We anticipate that these difficulties will increase sharply
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72. For this reason it is essential
                            that we reevaluate the essentiality of each <gloss target="#t_SEA1"
                                >SEA</gloss> program. As part of this review Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            to assess the relative priorities of all Department of Defense programs.
                            In their response they found that, in the absence of supplemental <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 funding from Congress, reductions in
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> air operations must be made if
                            we are to support other essential <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            and non-<gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> Department of Defense
                            programs. Since the mood of the Congress, in our judgment, prevents
                            consideration of supplemental funding at this time, Secretary <persName

                        <p>At the juncture, it is essential that we initiate the discussions with

                            Secretary Laird emphasized the urgency of this step. I believe that the

                            important for such countries as Indonesia, Thailand and Laos to know
                            that we are standing firm; we must keep the psychological factor in
                            mind.” (Central Intelligence Agency, Job 80–B01285 A, Executive Registry

                            that he equated the current views “with the decisions which he had made
                            on March 17 regarding the defense of Long Tieng in Laos. There we had
                            decided to use our air power and commit the Thailand battalions. It had
                            been a close decision, but this decision had eventually had some effect.
                            We had perhaps saved the decision for another year.” (National Archives,

                            arguments and problems, but even Frank Church and several other Senators
                            who had objected to Americans in Cambodia understood the principle of
                            Asians helping Asians. This might be a costly business, and Congress
                            didn't like it, but the South Vietnamese, the Thai, the Indonesians, and
                            others had an economic excuse for not assisting on their own. In

                        <p>Dear Dave:</p>
                        <p>I refer to your letter of June 13<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">
                                <ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> with regard to the
                            force reductions in Thailand. I agree wholeheartedly that time is of
                            essence, if we are to consult meaningfully with the Thais. We are
                            proceeding as you suggest to prepare negotiating instructions for
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> on an urgent
                            basis. However, I believe we must adhere to the following ground rules
                            if we are to keep from jeopardizing important programs in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>a. As I pointed out to you in my letter of May 21, we must provide
                            adequate time for genuine consultations with the Royal Thai Government.
                            It is therefore urgently requested that any overt actions to withdraw
                            our forces from Thailand, which have not already been agreed to by the
                            Thais, be held in abeyance until our consultations can be satisfactorily
                            completed. Furthermore, I think we must assure that any discussions of
                            this matter with the Thais be coordinated by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> in Bangkok. In preparing these
                            instructions we would <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0194"/>want to
                            address jointly with your staff those questions we can expect the Thais
                            to raise, and assure that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> will be in the best possible position to answer
                            them persuasively. In addition, it would appear that the evaluation
                            directed by the President of our current air activities in Southeast
                            Asia, as outlined in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>'s memorandum of June 15, could also affect the
                            extent of our troop withdrawals for Thailand. I am well aware of the
                            budgetary problems in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and I can
                            assure you that we will proceed with these consultations with dispatch
                            as soon as we have the necessary data to make a persuasive case to the
                            Thais.</p>
                        <p>b. I have no doubt that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop
                            withdrawals from Thailand at this point will create political problems.
                            Although we are working out plans with your staff based on the
                            recommended <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> reduction package, it is
                            necessary that the door be left open to reconsider the timing and extent
                            of the program in light of the Thai reactions and reactions from other
                            Asian allies as well as the Presidential directed evaluation mentioned
                            previously. Changes would be recommended only if essential <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> programs and objectives in the area stand
                            in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>I note that the decisions made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> with respect to Thailand are but part of a broader
                            package of decisions affecting our world-wide force posture for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971. I think it would be useful,
                            particularly in connection with the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_DPRC1"
                                >DPRC</gloss> budget review, if I could have a copy of the document
                            approved by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>; and
                            if you could arrange in the future for similar documents reflecting
                            major program decisions and which bear on our relations with our allies
                            and other friendly states, to be made available to us. I will, of
                            course, see to it that they will be used on a close-hold restricted
                            basis.</p>

                        <p>Dear Alex:</p>
                        <p>After our discussion over the weekend, I reviewed our force planning for
                            U.S. forces in Thailand. I have concluded our plans to withdraw 10,000
                            men during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 are militarily sound and
                            should be executed expeditiously. Let me briefly review our plans for
                            the 10,000-man phasedown.</p>
                        <p>About 40% of the 10,000-man reduction relates to the phaseout of four
                                <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105 squadrons and the closure of
                            Takhli Air Base. The <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105s were very
                            effective during the bombing of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, but
                            they are not well suited for interdiction in Southern Laos, particularly
                            strikes against moving vehicles. Also, they are not as effective against
                            enemy troop targets as are other aircraft in our force which will remain
                            in Thailand. The eight <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–4 squadrons which
                            will remain in Thailand, in conjunction with carrier and <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>-based tactical air forces, will provide
                            adequate capability for requirements in Northern and Southern Laos.</p>
                        <p>The air base at Takhli is the most appropriate candidate for phasing out
                            U.S. operations, being the farthest away from targets in Laos. By
                            closing out all U.S. activity, we can maximize the manpower and budget
                            savings with the least impact on military capability. After we phase out
                            of the Takhli base, we will still be able to increase the number <pb
                                n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0196"/>of aircraft deployed in
                            Thailand quickly, should the need arise. Each of the remaining bases has
                            some limited expansion capability and can handle additional aircraft on
                            an emergency basis. In addition we believe the Takhli Air Base will be
                            kept open by the Royal Thai Air Force (<gloss target="#t_RTAF1"
                                >RTAF</gloss>). A skeleton U.S. Air Force element will remain there
                            for the rest of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 to assist the Thai
                            in learning to operate and maintain the base. Re-entry should be
                            relatively easy since the base will be in full operation. In addition,
                            we could move another Navy carrier into the South China Sea, or return
                            forces to South Vietnam where ample air base facilities exist.</p>
                        <p>Another 15% of the planned 10,000-man phasedown concerns turnover of
                                <gloss target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss> aircraft to the South Vietnamese
                            in July 1971. These aircraft will be used in Laos until that time. Their
                            turnover is part of our Vietnamization program and Vietnamese pilots are
                            being trained to fly them. The loss of their truck-killing capability
                            will be more than offset by the addition of new B–57G sensor-equipped
                            aircraft and wider use of aircraft gunships. In this regard, I recently
                            directed the Air Force to modify additional <gloss target="#t_C1301"
                                >C–130</gloss> aircraft as gunships for use in the next dry season
                            campaign. Planned reductions in reconnaissance forces constitute another
                            15% of the total Thailand force reduction. These are possible because of
                            reduced overall sorties levels from Thailand.</p>
                        <p>We also plan to reduce Army engineers and transportation personnel (15%
                            of the total phasedown) because they have largely completed their
                            road-building efforts. A few parts of the projects may not be finished
                            at their planned deployment date. If necessary, a small engineer force
                            will be left to complete them, or local contractors will be used. The
                            remainder of the 10,000-man phasedown consists of miscellaneous support,
                            personnel, whose reduction will have little impact.</p>
                        <p>The 10,000-man phasedown reflects due consideration of the attendant
                            military risks and I fully support it. Many of the redeployments were
                            planned for the July–September period. We budgeted funds accordingly and
                            any delays will force us to reprogram funds from other activities. You
                            are well aware of our budget constraints and will appreciate our
                            interest in getting these decisions carried out promptly.</p>
                        <p>For the above reasons I believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> should proceed promptly with the necessary
                            consultations with the Royal Thai Government. In his discussions he can
                            assure the Thai that:</p>
                        <p>1. Reduction of <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105 and <gloss
                                target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss> aircraft in Thailand will be compensated
                            by additional AC–130 and B–57G aircraft which are considerably more
                            effective for the type missions being flown in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss> capability will remain in
                            Southeast Asia, although the aircraft will move to South Vietnam to be
                            flown by the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The withdrawal of the Army engineers will not jeopardize the projects
                            which we have promised the Royal Thai Government would be completed.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0197"/>
                        <p>4. Remaining bases in Thailand and elsewhere in Southeast Asia have ample
                            capability to support promptly an increase in our air assets, should the
                            need arise. Also Takhli will be available for re-entry should it be
                                needed.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">A joint State–Defense message to

                                This action was precipitated by a July 2 telegram from <persName

                                stated that he “had not had chance to talk to

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> responded to the
                            Secretary's mention of Cambodia and described the position of the <gloss

                            that country. He explained that he had exerted some restraint on the
                            Thai military leaders on the grounds that Thailand should <pb n="149"
                                xml:id="pg_149" facs="0198"/>not move too quickly until the military
                            situation in Cambodia became clearer and also until the results of the
                            Djakarta meeting follow-up were known. Furthermore, it was essential for
                            the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> to have an understanding of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government intentions and to know
                            what support would be available for whatever Thailand felt able to do.
                            He emphasized that the Thais could not afford to become militarily
                            deeply involved and find themselves left high and dry with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> having washed its hand of the Cambodian
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Secretary then reviewed for the <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> the actions which we contemplate, including the
                            provision of small arms and equipment and economic assistance as well as
                            the provision of some continuing air support of specified types. He
                            referred also to the help which <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would
                            provide Cambodia through a new <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            program for fiscal year 1971 (beyond the $8 million provided for fiscal
                            year 1970), surplus weapons and equipment, the hand-over of captured
                            items and perhaps some loans. The Secretary mentioned in addition the
                            military help which we anticipate South Vietnam will provide to Cambodia
                            and expressed the hope that others in the region will also help.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Secretary expressed specific hope that Thailand will do as much
                            as it possibly can and he inquired how the US could help in this regard.
                                <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> first referred to the
                            Black Panther unit now deployed to Vietnam and suggested that it might
                            be wise in view of the new developments in Cambodia and the dangers
                            closer to home for Thailand to use some of the Black Panthers to provide
                            for Thailand's forward defense in Western and Northern Cambodia. In the
                            discussion that followed the Secretary generally endorsed this idea
                            after ascertaining that the <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                            was speaking of only a part, say about 4,000, of the Black Panthers and
                            that he contemplated keeping some of the Panthers in Vietnam for some
                            time yet. He also made clear that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            could not support the Panthers either in border areas of Thailand or in
                            adjacent areas of Cambodia in the same way as they are now supported;
                            specifically subsistence and various allowances could not be paid by the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> under the circumstances although
                            we could probably re-supply them with ammo, spare parts, etc. through
                            the Cambodian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program. In answer to
                            a direct question from the <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>,
                            the Secretary said it is <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy to
                            encourage the Thais to provide direct military assistance to Cambodia as
                            it may be necessary. He referred also to the President's view that we
                            would understand that the Thais would put a priority on the use of their
                            troops to defend their own home ground. In answer to the <gloss
                                target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>'s question, the Secretary said
                            that he did not believe that there would be any obstacles, generally
                            speaking, put up by Congress which would stand in the way of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support of its allies who wish to help
                            Cambodia, but there were certain specific kinds of assistance which were
                            in question and would remain so until decisions were taken on some
                            pending legislation.</p>
                        <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>(4) The discussion then turned to possible Thai assistance in training
                            Cambodians and the help which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            might provide for this. Aside from the special arrangements which have
                            been almost completed for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for
                            the training of Thai ethnic Khmer, we are not able at the moment to say
                            precisely what help we can give although it almost surely would include
                            some outfitting and equipping and possibly additional supply of
                            consumables in Cambodia through Cambodian <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> emphasized
                            the teamwork he envisaged under the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine in which Thailand and other countries in
                            the area would provide manpower and the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> would assist with weapons, equipment and financial and
                            other support.</p>
                        <p>(5) The Secretary then turned to <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1"
                                >FonMin</gloss>'s obvious distress over statements made by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Senators and <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> press. He said that it was essential to recognize that
                            these are personal and individual views and do not represent position of
                            the Administration which deeply appreciates Thailand's position and the
                            help it has rendered. He said it was essential to have a thick skin
                            about critical comments and see them in perspective.</p>
                        <p>(6) Returning to Cambodia, the <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                            again expressed Thailand's very deep concern at this point about
                            Cambodian situation and the threat posed to his country. The Secretary
                            acknowedged this and said it was important for us to think about the
                            measure it might be essential to take if a collapse of the government in
                            Phnom Penh should threaten. He expressed the need to see that the supply
                            route via Kompong Som (Sihanoukville) not be re-established by the
                            Communists and he also mentioned the need to keep open access to Phnom
                            Penh via the Mekong.</p>
                        <p>(7) The Secretary then referred to the <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1"
                                >FonMin</gloss>'s mention the previous year of his efforts to
                            establish some contact with the government of Communist China. Thanat
                            said that nothing had come of these. He said that he was sure that the
                            Chinese would be glad to receive a secret mission from Thailand and then
                            would undoubtedly seek to exploit it to Thailand's disadvantage. The
                            Minister had no intention of playing this game, but was ready to talk
                            openly; the Chinese were apparently not interested in pursuing this at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>(8) At the conclusion Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> mentioned possible closer cooperation among the
                            four nations of the region to make better provisions for their own
                            security. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> generally
                            endorsed this idea, noting the obvious common interests which Thailand,
                            Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam had in this regard. He also mentioned the
                            reticence of the Lao to deal with the Cambodians and the South
                            Vietnamese; the Lao preferred to work on security matters only with the
                            Thais.</p>

                        <p>I understand:</p>
                        <p>—the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> is considering a proposal to
                            provide a <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL 480</gloss> loan of up to $20
                            million to the Thai,<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">See <ref target="#d76"
                                    >Document 76</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>—that this loan is intended to indirectly compensate the Thai for costs
                            associated with possible Thai and Thai Khmer force deployments to
                            Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Although I have not seen all the cable traffic on this proposal, I
                            understand the Thai have not asked for the <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL
                                480</gloss> program or even an explicit quid pro quo for their
                            Cambodian contribution. Rather, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> has suggested that such a program could be used to
                            help the Thai defray the expenses of their Cambodian effort. We would
                            give the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> $20 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL 480</gloss> commodities (e.g., wheat, tobacco,
                            cotton). Thai importers would purchase these commodities from the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> with local currency (Baht). According
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> proposal, sixty
                            percent of the budget receipts, $12 million, would be used by the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> in agricultural development while the
                            remaining $8 million would be allocated to U.S. uses. The theory is that
                            the Thai would divert currently budgeted agricultural development funds
                            to their Cambodian effort.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> proposed this
                                <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL 480</gloss> program on May 19, 1970. It
                            was not clear why Thailand needed the program at that time (the economic
                            circumstances of Thailand do not warrant such a pro-gram—see below) and
                            his proposal was not favorably received at the working level in State,

                                added, however, that “if you believe that such a program is in the

                            represents a clear case of “incrementalism.” It is an example of a
                            policy proposal made in response to immediate circumstances, that has
                            not been viewed in the larger context of U.S.-Thai relations, the total

                            has achieved throughout the 1960's:</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_GDP1">GDP</gloss> increased by 7.5%,</p>
                        <p>—budget revenues rose by 11.3%,</p>
                        <p>—foreign exchange reserves stood at a relatively high level of $875
                            million at the end of the year, having suffered a slight decline from
                            the over $900 million level achieved in 1968 as a result of U.S.
                            war-related expenditures in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>—Over the period 1971–1975 the Thai budget and balance of payments will
                            come under serious pressure if the Thai expand their forces and if U.S.
                            war-related military spending is reduced. This pressure could be
                            alleviated by increases in U.S. military assistance and increases in the
                            U.S. program assistance. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"

                        <p>—The Thai have been sensitive to U.S. press and Congressional criticism
                            of our commitment to Thailand. They have repeatedly sought and obtained

                            defend against its critics and possibly beyond what U.S. interests could
                            justify. The study concluded that a diplomatic strategy more closely

                            be easier to defend, less likely to raise Thai expectations beyond what

                        <p>—The Thai view the level of U.S. program assistance to Thailand as one of
                            the most important benefits of close cooperation with the U.S. and as a
                            signal of U.S. intentions to back up its commitment. The <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 51 analysis concluded that our past
                            program effort has been too diffuse and volatile to take full advantage
                            of the Thai perception of it. The study concludes that we should focus
                            our program effort in fewer areas, and set long-term program strategy
                            and funding goals in consultation with the Thai. Such an approach would
                            have the important ancillary benefit of improving Thai performance in
                            key areas, e.g., ground force performance.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 51 study presents several U.S.
                            assistance program packages. The package choices most consistent with
                            the threats to Thailand, and therefore the most likely to be selected,
                            will increase the level of U.S. assistance to Thailand. Assistance to
                            the army and air force and possibly economic assistance can be expected
                            to rise.</p>
                        <p>—You have asked for a study of U.S. strategy alternatives for Southeast
                            Asia. A decision to embark on a new style of assistance to Thailand,
                            which is what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>'s
                            proposal amounts to, should be made after a review of alternative burden
                            sharing arrangements, the forms of assistance we are able to give, etc.
                            While all decisions cannot await the formulation of a Southeast Asian
                            strategy, this one probably can.</p>

                            contribution will be in proportion to the overall Thai defense burden

                        <p>In accordance with your request there is attached the memorandum which I
                            received from our Thai people concerning the problem of United States
                            reduction of Air Force units in Thailand. This memorandum addresses
                            itself only to those reductions which our Embassy in Thailand knows are
                            included in the Fiscal Year 1971 program. Our Embassy in Bangkok is not
                            yet aware of the fact that one of the alternatives in the tactical air
                            package for Southeast Asia might result in the elimination of additional
                            squadrons and in the evacuation of the base at Korat.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, if there were any decision taken to accept the alternative
                            which involves the Korat evacuation, our problem with the Thai would be
                            even greater than is suggested in the attached memorandum. On the other
                            hand, if we are going to make such a decision we should not break the
                            news to the Thai piecemeal but should give them the bad news all at
                            once.</p>

                            package should leave the Korat installation intact. Therefore, if and

                        </list>
                        <p>During your forthcoming visit to San Clemente, the Viet-Nam Special Study
                            Group will take up with the White House the reduction of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> sortie rate from Thai bases. Whatever
                            decision is taken with respect to the sortie rate will be the foundation
                            for subsequent actions to reduce U.S. military forces in Thailand. As
                            you know from your conversations with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> in Manila and Tokyo, he is
                            greatly concerned not only over the size and pattern of the cuts
                            themselves but also over the political importance that there be
                            thorough, unhurried and genuine consultations and that in these
                            consultations we genuinely take into account Thai problems. In this
                            connection there are two important points:</p>
                        <p>A. That there be adequate lead time for consultation and planning process
                            to take place. In practice this would mean that there should be at least
                            60 days following the initiation of consultations with the Thai and
                            prior to the actual commencement of reductions. Thus if a decision were
                            communicated to Bangkok to commence consultations on August 1, <pb
                                n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0209"/>actual reductions in operations
                            and/or redeployment actions should not commence until October 1. This is
                            important not only for political reasons but to permit sound planning of
                            what will prove to be a very complicated process for the Thai.</p>
                        <p>B. That the close out of Takhli Air Base be phased so as to gear into the
                            Thai budgetary cycle, i.e. October 1, 1971, rather than on the proposed
                            date of June 30, 1971. I understand our budgetary rationale behind the
                            June 30 date, but there are substantial considerations arguing in favor
                            of an October 1 close-out. Some 1900 locally hired workers will be
                            thrown out of work in what is otherwise a tiny village community. There
                            will be substantial local economic dislocation. In addition, if the Thai
                            Air Force is to continue to keep Takhli open on a standby basis it will
                            have to make budgetary arrangements to do so. All of these
                            considerations will require budgetary and appropriation action by the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>. To close out on June 30, 1971
                            will leave a three-month gap which will plague both the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> and us in the future. If the
                            consultation process is to be meaningful, we must be prepared to take
                            account of this genuine problem. Even though the flying air squadrons
                            may have already redeployed the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            skeleton ground element should remain in Takhli until October 1.</p>

                                >Packard</persName>'s letter of June 30 to Under Secretary

                                <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note> that Defense expects
                            the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> to keep Takhli open. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> goes on to indicate
                            that “reentry should be relatively easy since the base will be in full
                            operation”. Since we are counting on the Thai to maintain the base in a
                            operational status, it is in our own interest to facilitate Thai
                            administrative and budgetary take over by phasing out our final
                            withdrawal until October 1.</p>
                        <p>While the meeting in San Clemente is primarily concerned with the sortie
                            rate and may not take specific questions of timing, yet the decisions to
                            be made on the sortie rate will to a large extent determine our
                            flexibility with respect to phasing and timing. I hope full
                            consideration will be given to these points in considering the reduction
                            of the sortie rate.</p></frus:attachment>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> also agreed “that projects for

                            battalions and six Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions
                            for paramilitary operations in South Laos should go forward.”</p>
                        <p>The last discussion of the meeting concerned the withdrawal of U.S.
                            forces from Thailand. Under Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> asked about the
                            withdrawal of air support and stated that the “Black Panthers are
                            leaving Vietnam, and some U.S. troops are leaving Thailand.” (Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> announced on
                            August 27 that his Government had informed the South Vietnamese
                            Government that it planned to withdraw its troops from that country.) In
                            response to Deputy Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_PDM1"
                                >David Packard</persName>'s question as to whether there was any
                            reason to keep Takhli open, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> made the following response:</p>
                        <p>“When you draw down your involvement in Thailand, it will be hard to get
                            back in. Since one could conclude that Thailand will be our anchor in
                            Southeast Asia, we might wish to pull troops now in South Vietnam into
                            Thailand. If this should be the case, we would want to keep as much
                            presence as possible in Thailand at this time. This is the argument that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has been giving me,
                            and I understand that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> agrees.”</p>

                                >Kissinger</persName> then stated, “I agree. Let's take out the
                                <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105s, but keep open the base for
                            now.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> concluded by
                            stating that if “we tell the Thais that we are getting out, we will have
                            to pay the political price. On the other hand, if we just take the
                            F–105s out, but leave the base open, we can come back at any time that

                            1970 message to the Congress the President prescribed the following
                            relationship between U.S. interests and U.S. commitments: <hi
                                rend="italic">“Our interests must shape our commitments rather than
                                the other way around.”</hi>

                        <p>U.S. strategic, foreign policy, military, political, and economic
                            interests are involved in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">U.S. Strategic and Military Interests in
                            Thailand</hi>—The U.S. has made extensive use of air bases and support
                            facilities in Thailand for wartime bombing and intelligence operations
                                <hi rend="italic">in Vietnam</hi>. The bases, however, remain under
                            nominal Thai control. Thailand is in an ideal position for staging
                            operations in Laos and for support efforts to help Cambodia. Thailand
                            has also made a contribution to the war effort in Vietnam as a Troop
                            Contributing Country.</p>
                        <p>In the event of a Sino-U.S. war, the U.S. would mount attacks from its
                            East Asian bases e.g. Japan, Philippines, Korea, etc., because they are
                            close to China's industrial and population centers. Bases in Southeast
                            Asia would be an asset but not of critical importance. Therefore,
                            Thailand is not of great strategic value vis-à-vis China. However,
                            Thailand is and will remain an important intelligence base for the
                            monitoring of Chinese activities. Thai-based installations are useful
                            for monitoring Chinese missile developments and potential military
                            preparations, particularly for attacks on Southeast Asia. However, with
                                <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0212"/>satellite air and seaborne
                            capability, the loss of Thailand as an intelligence base would deal a
                            severe blow to U.S. interests only with regard to our ability to have
                            the necessary warning to defend Thailand itself. Therefore, in the
                            absence of other U.S. interests, the intelligence value of Thailand
                            alone would not justify a U.S. commitment to defend Thailand.</p>
                        <p>As the major industrial power in Asia, Japan's security interests are
                            important to the U.S. However, unlike its attitude toward Korea, Japan
                            does not view its security to be closely linked to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">With regard to Southeast Asia</hi>, although the U.S.
                            has stated that it does not seek permanent bases in Thailand after the
                            Vietnam war, it is conceivable that U.S. interests in preserving the
                            outcome in Laos or Vietnam may require U.S. access to bases in Thailand.
                            A U.S. presence in Southeast Asia maintained by the U.S. <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment to Thailand, may also
                            provide a security umbrella against an overt Chinese or other threats
                            for nascent Southeast Asian regionalism or for individual nations (e.g.
                            Cambodia) where the U.S. has interests but no commitments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">In relation to East Asia and the Pacific Area</hi>. To
                            the South, Singapore possesses in the form of one of the largest and
                            most modern non-American naval bases in the world—airfields, and ship
                            and aircraft maintenance facilities—assets that could be used to support
                            military forces in East Asia and the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>A continued British and Australian presence in Singapore would probably
                            preclude the hostile use of these naval facilities as well as provide a
                            barrier to aggression across the Straits of Malacca. If Thailand were
                            neutral or under Communist control, the U.S. would have the option of
                            basing its own forces at Singapore in addition to the British and
                            Australian presence.</p>
                        <p>About 800 Free World ships each month pass through the Straits of
                            Malacca, but this route is of primary economic importance not to the
                            U.S. but to Japan, which is the world's largest importer of oil (90% of
                            which comes through the Straits). Even Japanese interests would not be
                            seriously endangered if the Straits were closed as oil tankers could
                            pass south of Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia itself constitutes a major U.S. security interest in East Asia,
                            although it is doubtful that a neutral or hostile Thailand would

                        <p>In the Pacific area, as long as Indonesia remains independent, there is
                            no direct link between the security of Thailand and the defense of
                            Australia, New Zealand or other Pacific powers friendly to the U.S. Nor
                            is there any direct link between Thailand's security and the security of

                                    >SEATO</gloss> and the Problem of U.S. Commitments</hi>— To the
                            extent that other powers gauge U.S. intentions on the basis of the
                            U.S.'s performance vis-à-vis Thailand—for example, our willingness to
                            honor our commitment to Thailand—our actions in Thailand will have wider
                            repercussions in Asia, particularly for those Asian nations such as
                            Korea, Japan, and Taiwan that rely on the U.S. to balance the influence
                            of China.</p>
                        <p>The same is true, although to a lesser extent, world-wide. While Thailand
                            may not be considered an area of vital U.S. interest, and the Thai may
                            be able to deal with their internal security problems on their own (or
                            at least without U.S. combat troops), the U.S. has an interest in
                            demonstrating fidelity to its international commitments. As the only
                            mainland Asian subscriber to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>,
                            Thailand ranks with South Korea and Taiwan as an area where the
                            credibility of the U.S. commitment in Asia could be put to the test.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Thus, the U.S. commitment and involvement in Thailand
                                are an element of the Asian balance of power. The size and nature of
                                our role can vary significantly in relation to alternative estimates
                                of the extent of U.S. involvement required to maintain regional
                                stability in the face of the likely threats. While the present
                                equilibrium in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> may be acceptable
                                to U.S. interests, other stable arrangements could also be
                                compatible with U.S. goals</hi>. For example, in the post-Vietnam
                            period a Thailand less dependent on the U.S. either as a result of <hi
                                rend="italic">increased Thai military capability, diminished
                                threats, or diplomatic realignment</hi> or some combination of these
                            three would not necessarily threaten the balance of power in Asia and
                            thereby U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Political Interests</hi>—In addition to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> relationship, informal or implied
                            U.S. commitments to Thailand stem from communications and contingency
                            plans relating to the formal commitment, implicit understandings
                            regarding U.S. programs in Thailand, and from Thai cooperation in
                            collective security actions in Asia, particularly in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The net effect of these informal obligations, over a period of twenty
                            years, has been a considerable deepening of the intimacy of U.S.-Thai
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, while there are no historic U.S. ties of friendship with
                            Thailand, there is a measure of intimacy that has resulted from a past
                            close U.S.-Thai relationship, particularly through the Vietnam war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Economic Interests</hi>—The U.S. does not have major
                            economic interests in Thailand. U.S. investments amount to about $200
                            million. Thailand <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0214"/>is not an
                            important trading partner of the United States; total U.S.-Thai trade in
                            1968 was $267 million. Thailand is not an indispensable source of scarce
                            resources for the U.S. It is not a major market for U.S. industry.
                            However, U.S. access to Thai airspace and U.S. landing rights in
                            Thailand are a decided convenience for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>—Thailand is not of vital interest to
                            the United States. Our greatest interest in Thailand derives from our
                            foreign policy objective of bringing the Vietnam war to a successful
                                conclusion.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">A notation next to this
                                sentence reads: “more a non-commie <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss>

                        </p>
                        <p>Beyond this, however, U.S. interests are not inconsistent with a new
                            equilibrium in Southeast Asia resulting from either a change in the
                            military balance or from diplomatic realignment. Whether U.S. interests
                            would be served by such developments depends largely on <hi
                                rend="italic">how the new situation is arrived at</hi>. That is, if
                            the U.S. acted precipitously in rejecting its alliance with Thailand,
                            U.S. foreign policy interests in Asia and world wide could be seriously
                            harmed.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if the threats to Thailand diminished as a result of
                            action by China, the Soviet Union or North Vietnam, or if Thai actions
                            increased Thailand's defense capabilities or improved its relations with
                            Peking or Hanoi and thereby lessened Thailand's dependence on the U.S.,
                            such developments would not threaten U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>The issue then is not whether U.S. interests can tolerate a Thailand less
                            intimately linked to the U.S., but whether ways can be found to diminish
                            Thailand's dependence and scale down the U.S. commitment to Thailand
                            without: (a) jeopardizing our immediate goals in Southeast Asia, or (b)
                            abandoning the Thai in a precipitous manner that would jeopardize U.S.
                            foreign policy goals.</p>

                        <p>The Banner Sun package represents total reductions of about 10,000 U.S.
                            personnel. This includes about 4,000 personnel associated with the
                            withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105s and 6,000 other

                        <p>The Banner Sun package was discussed at the <gloss target="#t_VSSG1"
                                >VSSG</gloss> meeting in Los Angeles and subsequently in the <gloss

                            both cases the discussion turned on whether Takhli should be kept open.
                            In Los Angeles the discussion was in the context of sortie levels. At
                            the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting the discussion
                            centered on whether we should inform the Thai of our intention
                            ultimately to close Takhli or whether we should agree to keep it open
                            and manned until October 1971, deferring until early spring informing
                            the Thai of our decision. At the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>
                            meeting it was agreed that we would keep Takhli open through October
                            1971, would withdraw the <gloss target="#t_F1">F</gloss>–105 units, and
                            would defer until spring 1971 decision as to whether to continue our
                            operation of the base after October 1971 or to turn over responsibility
                            to the Thai and to inform them of our intention to do so. <gloss

                        <p>In brief, I believe that these messages bring out the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—In May, soon after the U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            operations began in Cambodia, the Thai became concerned about the
                            implications for them of the Communist aggression in Cambodia and began
                            to consider the possibility of deploying regular <gloss target="#t_RTA1"
                                >RTA</gloss> forces into Cambodia to help prevent a Communist
                            takeover.</p>
                        <p>—An initial Thai concept was to deploy a regiment of the Black Panthers
                            from Vietnam into Eastern Cambodia, replacing it with other regular
                            forces from Thailand. The Black Panthers would thus have stayed on in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>—After State determined that we could not legally support the Black
                            Panthers in Cambodia unless operations were confined to the sanctuaries
                            (“fighting the Vietnam war in Cambodia”) and we discovered also that the
                            Thai intended to cover a broad area of Cambodia with these forces, an
                            alternative was considered of supporting Thai forces (two regiments)
                            from Thailand moving into Western Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>—We then (about the end of May) spoke of upgrading the two regular
                            Thailand regiments but retaining them in Thailand as “fire brigades”
                            pending deployment of the Thai/Khmer regiments.</p>
                        <p>—At this point we also began to engage in discussions with the Thai—from
                            the Thai standpoint the word “haggle” might be a better term—on how U.S.
                            support for these activities might be provided. We offered various
                            combinations such as prior-year Thai <gloss target="#t_MASF1"
                                >MASF</gloss>, trade-offs from economic assistance, and increased
                                <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL 480</gloss>. It may have appeared to
                            the Thai from this that we were fiddling while Rome was burning.</p>
                        <p>—As the June 30 date for the U.S. withdrawal from Cambodia neared and no
                            definitive arrangement for support of Thai forces in Cambodia was
                            arrived at, the Thai began to consider the withdrawal of all Black
                            Panther units from Vietnam to cope with dangers closer to Thailand,
                            possibly by committing them to Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>—However, the Thai themselves began to have some second thoughts about
                            too obvious a Thai military presence in Cambodia. Thai public opinion
                            did not appear enthusiastic about involvement. Foreign Minister Thanat
                            apparently exercised some influence on planning to assure that Thai
                            contributions to Cambodia would be kept clandestine. In addition, a
                            “high level political decision” was allegedly required before Thai
                            troops would be committed. The Thai were also concerned that their
                            moving into a military role in Cambodia would vitiate their influence as
                            one of the three Djakarta Conference convener governments.</p>
                        <p>—Once again, misgivings about the level of U.S. support may have played a
                            role in the Thai reservations. They have consistently found it very
                            difficult to understand why the U.S. has not moved more vigorously to
                            support them in coping with what they regard as clear and <pb n="169"
                                xml:id="pg_169" facs="0218"/>present threat to Thailand, and have
                            apparently not comprehended the legal, financial, and Congressional
                            complexities with which we must deal.</p>
                        <p>—The Thai concept which finally began to emerge from the withdrawal of
                            the Black Panthers (which has still not been formally announced) was not
                            to use them as a fire brigade but as the trained nucleus of expanded
                            Thai forces—apparently not for immediate use in Cambodia.</p>

                            which has now been dropped by the Thai.</p>
                        <p>When the Thai first proposed this on May 22 they emphasized the need for
                                [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], and
                            (b) the need for U.S. support essentially as provided for their forces
                            in Laos and South Vietnam. These two regiments were to be in addition to
                            the Thai Khmer regiments which we were already committed to support. At
                            that time <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0219"/>the Thai had agreed
                            to pay the salaries and expenses of the Thai Khmer regiments after they
                            were deployed in Cambodia. Our initial reaction was to go slow on the
                            regular Thai regiments, getting them ready (contributing equipment and
                            training support) but keeping them in reserve.</p>
                        <p>When the Thai persisted, we discussed with them the possibility of
                            overcoming the complex problems of support for these units in Cambodia
                            by employing them as an augmentation of the Thai Black Panther unit in
                            Vietnam. Some of the Black Panthers would then have moved into the
                            sanctuary areas.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, plans for the Djakarta Conference were advancing and a great
                            deal of emphasis was being placed on “neutrality” and “nonalignment” in
                            the Asian capitals. Our Embassies with State's backing were taking every
                            opportunity to remind governmental leaders of the need to protect their
                            “neutral” credentials to (a) get the conference off the ground, and (b)
                            assure a reasonable prospect for its success. This probably contributed
                            to the Thai Cabinet's decision to defer sending the Thai “volunteers” to
                            Cambodia—the Djakarta Conference called for removal of all foreign
                            troops from Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Thai desire for moving at least a regiment of the Black Panthers waxed
                            again in mid-June, but despite our offers of indirect help to make this
                            possible, they began to temporize. (The military situation in Cambodia,
                            which had seemed critical in early and mid-June had improved somewhat
                            which may have relieved some of the pressures on the Thai to move.) The
                            way in which our offers were couched may have contributed at this point
                            to a general uneasiness on the part of the Thai. State continued to
                            paint a picture of the legal complexities which we had to overcome in
                            giving any support. The effect probably was to suggest to the Thai that
                            we really did not favor their movement. At the same time we were
                            pursuing in all capitals the need for a vigorous follow-up to the
                            Djakarta conference—the inferences were “remember your neutral status”
                            and remember the Djakarta declaration that all foreign troops should
                            withdraw.</p>
                        <p>The net effect of all this seems to have been that the Thai doubted
                            either our willingness or at least our ability to come through with the
                            kind of financial support they wanted. Behind their desire for financial
                            support was also a clear hope for a U.S. commitment on behalf of their
                            military actions in Cambodia. On this aspect, too, there must have been
                            growing doubts. Despite occasional suggestions that they might be
                            willing to go ahead without substantial help from us, the weight of the
                            evidence is on the side that they wanted support of a kind they already
                            were receiving for their forces in Northern Laos and in Vietnam. Our
                            “explanations” of the difficulties of providing such support in Cambodia
                            probably led them to conclude that we would only reluctantly acquiesce
                            in such support and might not continue it for long. There would be no
                            commitment.</p>
                        <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0220"/>
                        <p>Thus our position probably may have been interpreted as comparatively
                            negative. This led the Thai in turn to reach a “political” decision not
                            to go ahead. It also reinforced their concern as to our future
                            intentions in the region—our Vietnam withdrawals, our ground force
                            withdrawal from Cambodia and our planned reductions in Thailand all
                            added up to produce a growing sense of uneasiness in Bangkok. When we
                            discouraged (with General Abrams' concurrence) the use of the Panthers
                            in Cambodia and didn't come forward with a positive and simple solution
                            to the support problems for the Thai regiments in western Cambodia, the
                            Thai probably concluded that the better part of valor was to tighten
                            their belts and bring the Panthers home to protect Thailand itself
                            before we withdrew the support we were then providing.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> continued to
                            suggest to Washington his enthusiasm for the project. State's
                            instructions, however, tended to imply some reticence to move ahead and
                            left <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> to carry the ball
                            without positive evidence of full support from the Department for the
                            project.</p>
                        <p>As evidenced at the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meetings
                            neither Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> nor Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> were enthusiastic at the prospect
                            of regular Thai forces in Cambodia. This accounts for the fact that most
                            cables originally were drafted in negative tone.</p>

                        <p>3. Meeting opened with briefing by <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                                >Dawee</persName> on insurgency in Thailand and situation in
                            Cambodia and Laos. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> raised <persName
                                corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s request for three Thai
                            battalions in Laos and need for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            support of these. Vice President discussed this in relation to domestic
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> political situation and danger of
                            exacerbating opposition's obstructive actions by attempting to provide
                            direct support to this type of operation. He emphasized need to find
                            indirect means of compensating Thai for cost of such operations. Vice
                            President went on to discuss background of political situation in United
                            States, political pressures of forthcoming election and Senate
                            attitudes. He stressed need to keep Thai-<gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> disagreements “in the family” to avoid giving advocates
                            of isolationist policy ammunition for use against administration.</p>
                        <p>4. Vice President spoke briefly on visit to Viet-Nam and Cambodia,
                            stressing impressive performance of <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. Vice President informed Thais that <gloss target="#t_FANK1"
                                >FANK</gloss> trained in Thailand could be equipped out of Cambodian
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, assuming this met with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> approval. When Thais urged that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> make decision to divert funds for this
                            purpose, <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> cautioned against expecting
                            United States to act without consulting Cambodians or to put pressure on
                            Cambodians on this kind of issue.</p>
                        <p>6. Thais referred to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press attacks on
                            them, citing recent Newsweek article by Maynard Parker. Vice President
                            urged them not to be too sensitive and not to mistake this type of
                            criticism for voice of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> people.
                            Thais complained of being described as “bending with the wind” when in
                            fact they had taken strong position against Communism.</p>
                        <p>7. Thais expressed appreciation for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            aid, including <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> offer. Thais
                            made strong appeal to Vice President not to reduce aid in face of
                            increased threat. Vice President pledged to so recommend. Vice President
                            expressed gratitude for Thai commitment and assistance in many parts
                            [garble].</p>
                        <p>8. Meeting ended with brief discussion of situation in Burma. End

                        <p>10. PriMin <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> led off, saying
                            Thai had no formal agenda but would simply try to provide <gloss

                            Thailand as basis for his report to the President. He said Thais would
                            appreciate getting from <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> report of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy, <gloss target="#t_VP1"

                            Thailand and on this part of the world. For his part, he would try to
                            help them understand certain aspects of the complex political situation
                            in the United States which he knew were difficult to comprehend. He said
                            he hoped they would not be inhibited by the well known and much
                            appreciated Thai courtesy, but would go to the heart of all matters. He
                            said we are engaged together in a difficult war with a determined enemy
                            and must be completely frank with one another about problems.</p>

                            because they were mostly hill tribes and received no support from

                                >Souvanna Phouma</persName> had asked for three Thai battalions, one
                            to serve in Sayabouri and two in Campassak and Sithadone. They were to
                            relieve Lao forces to move into other, more critical areas. <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> said he understood Washington approved
                            establishing six Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions,
                            but noted they had a four-month training cycle and could probably not be
                            deployed before January 1, 1971. He said <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                                >Souvanna Phouma</persName> wants help immediately and therefore the
                            three battalions should move in in the meantime. He asked <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support.</p>
                        <p>15. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said this is difficult because of
                            the political problems in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. We are
                            working on means to provide assistance, but it may not take the
                            traditional form.</p>
                        <p>16. The Ambassador referred to discussions held with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> and others the previous day concerning
                            this problem. He said we can help with <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>s for use in trail interdiction, but he expressed doubt
                            as to how much we can do in connection with a requirement for regular
                                <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0223"/>battalions in Sayabouri,
                            Champassak, and Sithandone. However, we were seeking a complete answer
                            on this from Washington.</p>
                        <p>16. The <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said the situation in Southeast
                            Asia is so distorted in the press coverage that people do not get a
                            clear picture of the nature of actions such as the assistance <persName
                                corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> is seeking. The Senate is
                            focusing intensely on this type of action in a very hostile way. While
                            we know it is needed and worthy of our support, that support cannot be
                            provided in the usual way at this time. (At this point, <gloss
                                target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> (who has kept himself very
                            closely informed on the various amendments which the Senate is
                            considering) spoke to the PriMin in Thai for some time explaining some
                            implications of the Cooper–Church, Fulbright, and other proposed
                            amendments.)</p>
                        <p>17. The <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said that press is generally
                            aware that there were some Thai forces in Laos, although we had not
                            confirmed their presence. He said <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            support of additional Thai forces for Laos could cause a real explosion
                            in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public opinion. Thus it was
                            necessary to look for other kinds of assistance which would permit the
                            Thais to transfer funds now allocated to other purposes to support such
                            measures as Thai battalions for Laos.</p>
                        <p>18. Impact of Political Situation in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> on Southeast Asian Policy: Against this background the
                                <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> discussed further the pressures
                            from the forthcoming elections and current attitudes in the Senate. He
                            noted that <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> had recently
                            come out in support of the <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2"
                                >McGovern</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HMO1">Hatfield</persName>
                            Amendment. Many voices are now calling upon us to leave Asia now
                            regardless of the consequences. The <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>
                            described the severe inflationary situation the President had inherited
                            from the previous administration. Thus he had been forced to trim
                            spending in an effort to reestablish a sane fiscal policy. Congress,
                            however, had insisted on large education and housing appropriations,
                            even overriding the President's veto, forcing the administration to trim
                            the defense establishment by $10 billion. This meant applying the knife
                            heavily all over the world, and facing considerable resultant
                            unemployment in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He said the
                            present was as tough a period of national adjustment as we had ever had
                            to cope with.</p>
                        <p>19. The <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> understands that we should
                            fulfill our role as a Pacific power and was determined that we would
                            keep our treaty obligations. He said the President would not have sent
                            him back after only seven months if he didn't think this part of the
                            world was important.</p>
                        <p>20. The <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> expressed the belief that if
                            the administration gets through the off-year election without erosion of
                            its position on the Hill, the situation would right itself. He said that
                            in many key races the issue was not partisan politics but was drawn
                            between isolationism and continuation of the administration's foreign
                            policy. He noted the domestic <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0224"
                            />political importance of his ability to go back and report firsthand on
                            the situation in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>21. He said the mood of isolationism in certain parts of American society
                            is directed strongly at Southeast Asia. He noted the contrast between
                            Fulbright's position on the Middle East and that on Southeast Asia. It
                            is politically tempting to appeal to people who are tired of the war, to
                            students and to the media who want immediate withdrawal from Asia.</p>
                        <p>22. He appealed to the Thai leaders not to construe our actions as
                            lessening support for them or weakening of our resolve. That would cause
                            the administration further difficulty in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>23. He said if our allies seem to be complaining and criticizing all the
                            time, people may get sick of it and go along with those who demand that
                            we get out. This would make it impossible for the President, the real
                            advocate of helping our friends. We must face the fact, he continued,
                            that we cannot say things in the same way or operate in the same way as
                            before. Even the limited statements he had made in relation to Cambodia,
                            for example, had attracted criticism. He said the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> faces an absolute crisis in government, and that the
                            administration cannot operate without Congressional support. He
                            concluded these remarks by noting that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> would help find less direct ways
                            to meet the needs of the situation.</p>
                        <p>24. Impact on Vietnamization of Situation in Neighboring Countries: The
                            PriMin said that he agrees with the program on Vietnamization and the
                            need to strengthen the Vietnamese ability to stand on their own feet.
                            However, he emphasized that if we do not assist victims of Communist
                            aggression such as Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, and if they are weakened
                            and lack support, it will be difficult for Vietnam itself to stand on
                            its own feet.</p>
                        <p>25. The Vice President agreed, recalling his observations to newsmen
                            concerning the effect on our withdrawals from Vietnam should Cambodia
                            fall to the Communists. Administration policy is to do exactly what the
                            PriMin suggests but unfortunately that is not the policy favored by some
                            in the legislative branch who believe that countries of Southeast Asia
                            can be allowed to go Communist without any serious repercussions.</p>
                        <p>26. The Vice President said he would like to see assistance accelerated,
                            especially in light of the troop withdrawals we are making, but we must
                            have appropriations to do this and these are under pressure in every
                            respect. He noted that the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                            appropriation today is the lowest in terms of percentage of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> since 1950. Even so, there are members
                            of the House and Senate who would cut it further. They seem to want
                            complete abandonment of our foreign obligations and total focus on our
                            domestic problems. They apparently assume that Communists have suddenly
                            become benign.</p>
                        <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0225"/>
                        <p>27. In sum, while the administration wants to assist countries of this
                            area, it must play a cautious game so long as public opinion remains in
                            its present state.</p>
                        <p>28. The PriMin commented that if dove views prevail there will be great
                            danger in due course not only to this part of the world but to other
                            parts as well. The Vice President agreed.</p>
                        <p>29. Thailand and the Future of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine: The PriMin said Thailand agrees with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and is trying
                            to implement it as it had been described to them by the President. They
                            do not require manpower, but must have material assistance or the
                            doctrine could not be implemented. He suggested that Congress may
                            destroy or negate the Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>30. The Vice President said a fight is going on for the confidence of the
                            American public. At stake is the course we will take in foreign policy.
                            He said he thinks the administration will win this fight. He asked them
                            not to attach too much importance to the gloomy picture he had painted
                            because he regularly looks at the darker side so as to be prepared for
                            the worst. He believes that when the full importance of our material and
                            economic assistance is better understood, and as we reduce our armed
                            forces in the area to acceptable levels, public opinion can be turned
                            around. He believes people will ultimately understand that the cost of
                            preventing the war from spreading is vastly less than that of fighting
                            it after it expands.</p>
                        <p>31. The Vice President said he recognized the necessity of finding the
                            means of turning the tide politically so that we can carry out our
                            policy for this area directly and proudly as it should be carried out.
                            He said many people had been sold a bill of goods to the effect that
                            people of this area want communism.</p>
                        <p>32. He again appealed to the Thais to recognize the difficulties the
                            President faced and not let disappointments go beyond the family to the
                            point where they were exploitable by isolationist politicians and others
                            who would say our allies want only our money and endlessly criticize
                            us.</p>
                        <p>33. Press Attacks on Thailand: The <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> said that Thailand was attacked less by the
                            Communist side than by the “Eastern Seaboard Establishment” and “The
                            Washington–New York Axis.” He then read from the recent Newsweek article
                            on Thailand. He said millions of people would read this and be
                            influenced by it.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is the Summary of Conclusions.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Thai-Khmer Units</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: The Cambodians have now decided they
                            don't want the Thai Khmer units, and the Thais are in the process of
                            disbanding them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Are they already
                            disbanding them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: They will start very shortly. There
                            would be an advantage in converting the Thai Khmers into <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s, which could be used in Laos, where
                            they are needed. We prepared a draft message—which is now being
                            circulated—suggesting to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> that he discuss this possibility with the Thai. In
                            the meantime, <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> has come in
                            with a similar proposal. I would like to move that we dispatch our
                            cable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>: What does the cable
                            say?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: It tells <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> to talk to the Thais about turning the Thai-Khmer
                            units into <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s.</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0227"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If these troops are
                            partially Khmer, will they be enthusiastic about fighting in Laos?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: We have raised this question in our
                            draft cable. It can be pointed out to the Thai Khmers that they would be
                            helping in the defense of Cambodia. The pay will also be an inducement.
                            Of course, some of them may nevertheless drop out. We also ought to take
                            into account that we already have the money available for the <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>: I think these
                            operations in Southern Laos are useful.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That may be true;
                            but before the year is out, we may be hard pressed in Cambodia and may
                            be wishing we had two regiments to put in. I am reluctant to see our
                            assets disappear. We should also keep in mind the President's view that
                            he does not want Cambodia to go down the drain without some effort on
                            our part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>: In Southern Laos the
                            units will be doing just as much good for Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Possibly they will be more helpful if
                            used there.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If that is the
                            case, why didn't we think of putting them there in the beginning?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>: Our concern then was
                            about the immediate problem of bolstering the capabilities of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FANK1">FANK</gloss>. Since that time, they have given
                            evidence of having some staying power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>: Also, the Cambodians
                            won't integrate the Thai Khmer units into the <gloss target="#t_FANK1"
                                >FANK</gloss> sufficiently to make it possible for us to employ
                            Cambodian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds in the program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>
                            operation is undoubtedly more pertinent to the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>: If the Thai Khmer units
                            are needed later in Cambodia, they can be relocated.</p>
                        <p>Lt. Gen. Vogt: The Thai Khmers can be used right now. They have equipment
                            and ammunition. They will be a wasted asset unless we make some use of
                            them now. Placed astride the enemy supply lines in southern Laos, they
                            can make a real contribution to the defense of Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We were going to
                            establish the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s anyway. Using the
                            Thai Khmers won't add anything to our total assets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: It will mean that those assets will be
                            more immediately available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: Actually, the
                            Thai Khmers will add to the total of <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then the Thai
                            Khmers would be in addition to the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                            earlier planned for Southern Laos?</p>
                        <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: Yes. There would
                            eventually be a total of eight Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>s. In addition, we have been having difficulty finding
                            personnel for the proposed Lao <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s.
                            Using the Thai Khmers will permit us to move ahead immediately.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>: Then we will end up with
                            eight Thai and four Cambodian <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: That's
                            right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wells: One of the Cambodian <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s is
                            at Pakse now. The second is in training, and the third and fourth will
                            be coming in at the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>) I feel the same frustration
                            you do with the Thais. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName> has had more success than we anticipated.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And possibly more
                            than he can sustain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: We will be
                            significantly assisting Cambodia if we choke the enemy supply lines.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If <persName
                                corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> knew that the present Cambodian
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> might be supplemented, do you
                            suppose he would continue to refuse the Thai Khmers?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: Basically, he doesn't
                            like having Thai troops in his country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: The Cambodians
                            have had a lot of trouble with the South Vietnamese troops. They would
                            rather do without foreign troops now that their needs are less
                            pressing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I think there is no doubt that using
                            the Thai Khmers in southern Laos is the best way to help <persName
                                corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Lt. Gen. Vogt: <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> thinks so
                            too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will probably
                            never see any Thai troops anyway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wells: We still have one problem. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> is concerned about pay scales.
                            This has been holding up the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s for
                            four weeks. <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> says that it
                            isn't possible to have Thai units in Laos on two different pay
                            scales.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: How much is the difference?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wells: It is significant. The <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                            are much cheaper. An <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> costs us
                            $1,250,000 a year. The three artillery batteries and three battalions in
                            Long Tieng cost about $25 million.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>: It would be much better

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>'s proposal is eventually to
                            have all Thai units in Laos be <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Did he think that
                            up himself?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why did he suddenly
                            come up with the idea? Everyone has told me that having units in Long
                            Tieng has been financially very advantageous to the Thais. Why should
                            they give this up?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wells: General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> is
                            looking forward to the return of the dry season. He doesn't want to have
                            regular Thai units exposed to a major North Vietnamese offensive.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Has there been a
                            rainy season offensive by our side?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: There has been some
                            action in connection with Operation Leapfrog.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Holdridge: There is another explanation for <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>'s proposal. It would mean
                            putting a substantial portion—thirty-eight battalions— of the Thai Armed
                            Forces on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> payroll.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is everyone

                                satisfied with the idea of shifting the Thai Khmer regiments to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s in southern Laos. In a

                                    >Kissinger</persName> identified the following “serious risks:
                                The Cambodians probably will need all the help they can get two or
                                three months from now.” He also noted that the <gloss

                                available—they would be dispersed and hard to redeploy.” Finally, he
                                claimed that “there is no assurance that the personnel of the
                                regiment (who volunteered for Cambodia) would be willing to accept
                                the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> role in Laos. We run the
                                risk therefore that in pursuing this course we may in fact be

                        <p>You are probably aware that a strongly held view in the State Department
                            is that the U.S. should not urge the Thai to deploy ground forces
                            outside Thailand, e.g., in Laos and Cambodia, except perhaps on
                            short-term cross-border operations.</p>
                        <p>Those who favor this “Fortress Thailand” view do so for a variety of
                            reasons, including a fear that Thai ground operations outside Thailand
                            will provoke a retaliatory response from Hanoi or Peking. One of their
                            strongest arguments is that the limited Thai military capabilities that
                            are available should be deployed against the insurgent threat within
                            Thailand.</p>

                        <p>Tanham, who until recently served as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>'s Special Assistant for
                            Counterinsurgency, argues as follows:<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4"
                                >Although <persName corresp="#p_SKW1">Smith</persName> summarized
                                Tanham's two main points, the latter made numerous other
                                observations in his June 1970 memorandum. Some of his points are
                                specific, e.g. “too many young officers in Bangkok,” while others
                                are more general. For example, in his speculation concerning the
                                reason for Bangkok's “probably complacent” attitude towards the
                                insurgency, Tanham theorizes that “their successful experience in
                                maintaining their independence,” their “leaders' belief in the basic
                                loyalty of the Thai people,” and “an inadequate understanding of the
                                real threat of communist revolutionary warfare” all played a
                                part.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> does not take the insurgent
                            threat seriously enough and is not devoting adequate attention or
                            resources to its insurgency problems. For example, <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> units deployed against the insurgents
                            are poorly trained and undermanned.</p>
                        <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>—Efforts by the U.S. to involve the Thai outside Thailand indirectly
                            divert Thai attention from their internal problems. Moreover, in
                            responding to U.S. requests to deploy “forward,” the Thai may believe
                            that such deployments increase the U.S.'s obligation to help Thailand
                            meet its insurgent threat.</p>
                        <p>Tanham's reasoning drastically simplifies an exceedingly complex problem.
                            Thai decisions on out-of-country deployments turn more on their view of
                            their security interests than anything else, although financial
                            inducements play an important role. Furthermore, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 51 study has found no one-to-one
                            trade-off between <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> capability to meet
                            the external versus the internal threat. It is more likely that the Thai
                            will:</p>
                        <p>—meet neither threat if they do not reform their forces or receive
                            appropriate U.S. assistance, or</p>
                        <p>—meet both threats if they do take the necessary reform actions and U.S.
                            assistance is provided intelligently. <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"
                                >NSSM</gloss> 51 lays out several options designed to promote Thai
                            force effectiveness against the internal and external threats and weighs
                            the advantages and disadvantages of external deployments as a separate
                            political and strategic military issue.</p>

                            do now in Laos with Surakij and <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                                >Praphat</persName> in which climate established for working level
                            exploration to see what might be done. Ambassador emphasized that
                            Washington has not agreed any specific plan.</p>
                        <p>“3. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] followed up in working skull session with Surakij
                            on afternoon 18 September. Following are results of this meeting, all of
                            which subject to specific agreement between Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> that these arrangements are
                            desirable after some more working level negotiation.</p>
                        <p>“4. General Surakij agreed our understanding of the principle of ‘one pay
                            scale’ for Laos and said it could be at the <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss> rate. He accepted the desirability of an eventual 13
                            Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s to include Long Tieng
                            replacements. He had some reservations that Thais might not be able to
                            recruit and train 13 in end of year timeframe, but he did not raise this
                            as an objection. Finally, he agreed in principle that the 13 could be
                            used ‘anywhere’ in Laos after consultation; and he endorsed the current
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] pattern of operation, agreeing that the
                            arrangements for command and control of the Thai regulars currently at
                            Long Tieng are not really satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>“5. Surakij's problems grew out of the conversion of the <gloss
                                target="#t_TKV1">TKV</gloss> regiment to three <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s. First, he had in mind that agreement
                            with the Cambodians that these troops would be held in some sort of
                            ready reserve in case the call came from Phnom Penh. Second, he saw
                            problems with morale inherent in the conversion which he would prefer to
                            avoid.</p>
                        <p>“6. Surakij expressed desire to have first Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss> deployment put in Champassak, Sithandone, and
                            Sayaboury. He went on, however, that the units would not be irrevocably
                            tied to these locations. First, these areas would be considered
                            rotational; and second, if no <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/Pathet
                            Lao presence established, units would be moved to areas where
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>“7. Wish reiterate that all of above is exploratory with both sides
                            carefully repeating that no decisions have been made and in particular
                            Washington has not given approval for any specifics.” (End of
                            Message)</p>

                        <p>After expressing pleasure at seeing Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> again, Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked about the President's
                            European trip and whether it had been regarded as useful. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that the trip had
                            been very good, considering what had been attempted. Its purpose had
                            been to demonstrate U.S. power in the Mediterranean, and as an old
                            friend of the Foreign Minister, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could tell him that we had achieved what we
                            had wanted. Even in a Communist country such as Yugoslavia, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had found it more
                            important to remain and talk to the President than to go to Cairo for
                            Nasser's funeral. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> remarked that he had been glad to watch the
                            effective way that the trip had been conducted.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            President had specifically asked him to convey his, the President's,
                            personal respects to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> and to inform him of the high regard in which he
                            was held by the President. The Foreign Minister then declared that the
                            people and the government of Thailand consider the President their
                            friend. This also applied to the people of Asia as well. Some
                            unfortunate developments may have occurred in the U.S.-Thai
                            relationship, but on fundamental things the relationship between the two
                            countries remained firm.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked for Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s frank opinion
                            with respect to one question. Last April and May, there had been talk of
                            putting two regiments of regular Thai troops or two regiments of Thai
                            Khmer volunteers into Cambodia. Since then endless discussions had
                            ensued. Was it because the Thai had become distrustful of our
                            bureaucracy that their interest in sending their forces into Cambodia
                            had <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0234"/>cooled? The Foreign
                            Minister said that he would give a frank and straightforward reply.
                            There were a number of reasons as to why the Thai had not sent in their
                            forces. First, long debates had been held in Bangkok in which some
                            people, particularly the military, had wanted to send Thai soldiers to
                            Cambodia; others, however, had felt that this would not have been
                            desirable because if the Thai had sent in two battalions or two
                            regiments, the Communists might have sent in the same number or
                            more.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            said that in the second place, the mood in the U.S., as far as could be
                            judged from the press and from Congressional comment, was very hostile
                            toward Thailand and not appreciative of its role. Therefore, he had
                            thought that nothing should be done to aggravate the situation and
                            increase the President's political burden. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that the trouble was
                            some liberals here disliked the U.S. so much they felt that any country
                            which appreciated the U.S. had to be punished. They talked about what
                            Bangkok should and should not do, and not about Hanoi. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> observed that despite
                            all, “you're with us and we're with you.”</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> mentioned
                            as a third consideration in the Thai judgment on sending troops into
                            Cambodia the fact that they had worked out an arrangement with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> during his visits
                            to Bangkok whereby the Cambodians could ask for Thai troops if they were
                            in great need of them. In such a case, Thai forces stationed along the
                            Cambodian border would join with the Cambodians in task forces to “beat
                            up the Communist side.” This arrangement was one of the reasons which
                            had prompted the Thai to bring back some of their troops from Vietnam.
                            These troops would be moved to the Thai-Cambodian frontier.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that if the
                            Thai received any advice from our people to the effect that the Thai
                            should not be there on the frontier but rather in the Northeast, this
                            would be a violation of the intentions of the President and the Foreign
                            Minister should get in touch with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> about it. We wanted Thai forces to be
                            stationed near the Cambodian frontier. The Foreign Minister remarked
                            that he was not aware of anyone on the U.S. side who wanted Thai troops
                            in the Northeast. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            went on to say, however, that if any such advice was actually given to
                            them they could tell the advisers what the President's intentions were.
                            He could assure the Foreign Minister that he spoke for the President.
                            The stationing of Thai troops on the Cambodian frontier was exactly what
                            we were looking for. Commenting further on the plan to bring Thai troops
                            back from Vietnam, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> said that this move would cost less than raising
                            new units. New units might cost millions of baht, require an increase in
                            taxes, and create a political tempest. The Vietnam situation did <pb
                                n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0235"/>not appear so urgent now as to
                            require the whole Thai complement, and it was felt that “some” of the
                            Thai troops could be brought back.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we
                            welcomed this Thai move. We thought that the situation in Cambodia could
                            deteriorate, and it was comforting to know that there were forces
                            available which might be able to do something. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> confirmed that the Thai
                            were prepared to act in Cambodia, but not on a permanent basis. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned in
                            passing that the Thai troops in Long Tieng had made a big difference.
                            Referring again to the Thai rationale on troops in Cambodia, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> recalled at the
                            Djakarta Conference Thailand had pledged in the joint communiqué along
                            with the other participants to support a call for the withdrawal of all
                            foreign forces in Cambodia. Accordingly, if Thai troops had been sent
                            in, the spirit of the joint communiqué would have been violated.
                            Thailand felt that it had assumed a moral obligation under this
                            communiqué. In the light of all these circumstances, the Thai believed
                            that they would gain advantages on all sides by bringing some troops
                            from Vietnam, and stationing them on the border in agreement with the
                            Cambodians. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            endorsed this as a good solution.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then asked
                            if the U.S. could support Thailand logistically if Thai troops went into
                            Cambodia. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied
                            affirmatively. We had tremendous legal problems because of Congressional
                            actions, but believed it would be possible for us to replace in Thailand
                            those stocks of military equipment which the Thai used in Cambodia. The
                            Thai could employ the stocks which they had on hand at present. In
                            response to a question from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> as to whether it would be possible for the U.S.
                            military representatives in Thailand to tell the Thai this, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that if the
                            Thai talked to our Ambassador, he would give five million reasons as to
                            why there was a problem. However, he could assure the Foreign Minister
                            that if Thailand had to go in, we would find a way to give support. It
                            was hard to say now just how this would be done. It would be best to use
                            the stocks Thailand presently had on hand and we would replace them. We
                            would need to figure out just how this would be done.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked in
                            what way this matter could be undertaken—supposing that Thailand was
                            seized with a request from Cambodia, could he get in touch with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> personally? If and
                            when the needs arose, could he let Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> know? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> referred to the private channel which existed
                            between the Foreign Minister and himself, and said that if it turns out
                            we couldn't help he would tell the Foreign Minister. He reminded him,
                            though, that we had kept our promises to the government in Bangkok, and
                            had not given up any territory to the Communists. We did not want
                            Cambodia to go under. <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0236"/>The
                            President was not like Senator <persName corresp="#p_MCEJ1"
                                >McCarthy</persName>, who had wanted to abandon South Vietnam. We
                            had a massive internal problem, but if we were lucky, we would have an
                            easier time after the November elections.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked if
                            the election prospects were good, to which Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he was not a
                            domestic expert and couldn't say too much. While this was an off-year
                            election in which everyone in the House had to run for reelection and in
                            which the Administration party usually lost seats, there would be no
                            problem here and we expected some losses. In the Senate, it was possible
                            that the Administration might gain two or three seats. It might not seem
                            like this would make much difference, but many votes had been running
                            close to 50/50, and three seats more would make a significant
                            difference. If the Administration gained seven seats, it could organize
                            the Senate and get rid of Senator Fulbright. In this case it would be in
                            great shape and could do a lot of things for Thailand which were not now
                            possible. Arithmetically, the prospects were in our favor. Lots of
                            Republicans had lost in 1964 because Goldwater had been running for
                            President and had taken them down with him; hence there were more
                            Democrats in the Senate now than would normally have been the case.
                            Unfortunately, to speak frankly, in two big states we had poor
                            candidates. In California, Senator <persName corresp="#p_MG3"
                                >Murphy</persName> had cancer but was resisting all efforts to
                            induce him not to run, while in New York, Senator Goodell had decided to
                            run to the left of Fulbright. We were not supporting him. Nevertheless,
                            even though our gains were limited to only three seats, this would make
                            a lot of difference. 51 to 49 votes against the Administration would be
                            reversed.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> expressed
                            the hope that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                            prediction would come through. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said he felt that we had the Democrats on the
                            defensive over a lot of issues. For example, in May they thought they
                            could defeat the Administration on Southeast Asia, but today we had the
                            public on our side. The Foreign Minister thought that the President had
                            indeed handled the Vietnam question very well, and was interested in
                            knowing anything Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            could tell him about what the President would say that evening. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was surprised that
                            the Foreign Minister had not yet been informed as to what the President
                            would say, and gave a quick run-down on the President's five
                                points.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">For President <persName

                        <p>In connection with U.S. troop withdrawals, Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked if we were going to set a
                            withdrawal deadline. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>'s reply was “absolutely not.” In principle we
                            were willing to <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0237"/>withdraw
                            completely and give a fixed deadline, but not before all other issues
                            were settled. This would be conditional on everything else, including a
                            North Vietnamese withdrawal. When questioned by the Foreign Minister
                            about elections, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            declared that we were willing to have the North Vietnamese participate
                            in the electoral process and gain their support in elections to which
                            they were entitled, but would not accept their demands for a coalition
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> remarked
                            that he had made a suggestion in his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            General Assembly speech that if the four great powers could join
                            together for a Middle East settlement, they might also work with the
                            Asian countries toward a settlement in Asia. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that the exception
                            would be the French, who were not steady. The Foreign Minister said on
                            this point that it would be necessary to work for their support, since
                            they claimed to play a role. He had felt that the French were not
                            entirely negative, and cited a speech by Schuman as containing some
                            positive elements. In any event, the difference between the Middle East
                            and Southeast Asia was that the four powers were working alone in the
                            Middle East, while he did not want this to apply to Southeast Asia but
                            preferred that they worked together with the local people. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that this was the
                            reason why we wanted a larger conference on Indo-China. The U.S. had
                            done well to get a cease-fire in the Middle East, and a similar
                            situation might be attained in the Far East working in concert with the
                            nations of the area. The Foreign Minister stressed that he wanted these
                            nations to play a more effective role. He also was wondering about the
                            possibility of reaching an agreement between the U.S. and the
                            U.S.S.R.—if the Soviets stopped supplying Hanoi with the sinews of war
                            the fighting would end.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked the Foreign
                            Minister for his views on the situation in Vietnam. The Foreign Minister
                            stated that he had last been in Vietnam for the July <gloss
                                target="#t_TCC1">TCC</gloss> meeting and had been impressed with the
                            improvement in the situation and in the general appearance of the
                            country which had occurred since his previous visit. It was his belief
                            that the enormous amount of U.S. war matériel available should enable
                            the South Vietnamese to take over a good part of the defense of the
                            country once they were trained to handle this matériel. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we thought the
                            same thing. The Foreign Minister then cited his Prime Minister as
                            believing that Vietnamization alone would not have a lasting effect if
                            the Communists could use Laos and Cambodia— if these countries were
                            available to them, they could launch new attacks on South Vietnam and
                            offset the improvements which had taken place there. The present
                            situation in Vietnam would be only temporary if the military balance in
                            Laos and Cambodia could not be improved.</p>
                        <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0238"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if the Foreign
                            Minister thought we were being as active as we could be in operating
                            against the <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi Minh</persName> trail.
                            The Foreign Minister referred to the problem of supply, noting that the
                            U.S. seemed to be finding it increasingly difficult to assist local
                            forces in terms of economic and logistical support. He went on to refer
                            to a lack of agreement on the use of local forces in Laos. The Thai
                            would prefer to have forces of countries closest to the scene conduct
                            the operations. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            agreed with this, and pointed out that we had already undertaken to
                            train 2,000 Cambodians for operations in Laos. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> indicated that he knew
                            of this, and noted also that at the time of his departure there had been
                            discussions about sending Thai forces “far into Laos” to fill up the
                            vacuum while the Cambodian troops were being trained. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed some surprise, and
                            wondered when the Foreign Minister had left Bangkok. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said his departure had
                            been three weeks earlier, at which time the U.S. had wanted to send Thai
                            forces to the extreme southeast region of Laos beyond the Bolovens
                            Plateau to a point close to the Cambodian frontier. The Thai had
                            disagreed. They were in agreement on stationing Thai <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s in Sithandone and Champassak, but the
                            other area was too far east. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> referred to the difficulties which the
                            bureaucracy had created over the Thai troops, and said that this issue
                            of the Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s would be put on the
                            agenda for the next <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting. In
                            the ensuing discussion, the Foreign Minister made it clear that he was
                            not opposed to the recruiting of six Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>s for use in operations against the North Vietnamese
                                <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s along the Se Kong River and in
                            the Bolovens area of South Laos, but would object to any plans which
                            would call for deployment further east. It was pointed out to him that
                            we were in general agreement on this concept as well as with the Thai
                            concept of stationing some of their <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                            in Sayaboury, Sithandone, and Champassak.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> inquired about the
                            use of the Thai Khmer volunteers for service as <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>s in South Laos. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said that there would be no major
                            difficulty regarding this concept.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked if
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had any plans to
                            come to the Foreign Minister's part of the world, or if the President
                            had any further travel plans. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied that he personally would be delighted
                            to go back, but did not know when he could get away. The President would
                            not be making any more trips until next year. The main thing he wanted
                            the Foreign Minister to know was that everything the President had ever
                            said concerning Thailand could be believed. The President had a great
                            admiration for the Foreign Minister, and for selfish reasons was very
                            glad that he had been elected to the Thai Parliament last year. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> assured Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that the Thai for
                            their part hadn't changed. What he personally had said with respect to
                            some critics of Thailand did not affect Thai-U.S. friendship.</p>
                        <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0239"/>
                        <p>He had felt it necessary to defend the honor of his country, and hoped
                            that the President would understand. The Thai government had no problems
                            with the President or with the Administration. With the U.S. press,
                            though, there were indeed some problems.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> concluded by urging
                            the Foreign Minister to keep in close contact with him through the
                            special channel. If the Thai decided the time had come to move into
                            Cambodia, he should get in touch and we would work out the
                            modalities.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary took advantage of a previously scheduled call by Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> to brief him on
                            the Southeast Asia peace proposals that the President intended to put
                            forward in a television speech that evening.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d91fn2">footnote 2, Document 91</ref>.</note>
                            After he had heard the outline of the President's proposals, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> expressed the cautious judgment
                            that it would be a useful initiative.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s first question concerned
                            the concept of an enlarged conference that the Secretary had mentioned.
                            He was relieved to know that we did not have a “Geneva-type” conference
                            in mind. He then went on to comment that there were a number of Asian
                            nations who would probably be willing to assist in cease-fire
                            supervision measures. <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0240"/>He
                            mentioned Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Burma and Malaysia. He commented
                            that the Japanese would want to participate only through civilians and
                            that he supposed that, if the Pakistanis participated, the Indians would
                            also wish to do so. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then
                            noted the importance of the Soviet role in any peace negotiations. He
                            said that if the two super powers can agree, then peace can be obtained.
                            He went on to say that in New York he had been talking with other Asian
                            leaders such as Romulo and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                            about a plan to appeal to the big powers, especially the Soviets, to
                            work for peace in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> characterized relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as quite good. He said in connection
                            with the Thai forces in South Vietnam, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> wants the Thai to leave a token force there.</p>
                        <p>Further concerning Thai troops in Vietnam, he said the Thai want them
                            back in Thailand as a back-up force along the Cambodia/Laos border. He
                            said that they did not think it desirable now to send forces into
                            Cambodia but that it was necessary to have troops ready nearby to take
                            action in Cambodia if necessary. To send troops in now on a permanent
                            basis would give rise to problems of financing,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d92fn3">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"

                                    >Green</persName> noted that the Fulbright amendments to the
                                1971 Military Procurement Appropriations Act excluded “the use of
                                any such funds to support Vietnamese or other free world forces in
                                actions designed to provide military support and assistance to the
                                Governments of Cambodia or Laos.” This amendment was approved by the
                                Senate-House conference committee and was awaiting the President's
                                signature to become law. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                                added that although the legal advisers were “reviewing the
                                language,” “it appears that it will preclude U.S. support from the

                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> inquired about
                            conditions in the Middle East. The Secretary responded with comments
                            indicating that he thought prospects for peace there were somewhat
                            improved. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> observed that the
                            most helpful sign was the apparent fact that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and the Soviet Union were both willing to work for
                            peace. This he saw as a lesson for Southeast Asia. He said that he was
                            convinced that, if the Soviets would give the word, the North Vietnamese
                            would accept peace.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then mentioned the Djakarta
                            Conference and the follow-up actions of the Committee of Three. He said
                            they had reached a dead-end and there was now need for a new initiative.
                            He said, “We can't sit down and twiddle our thumbs.”</p>
                        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0241"/>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the Djakarta Three could make use of the
                            President's proposals and give their support to them. <persName

                            determine this after they had studied the speech. He said he would be
                            seeing <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and Romulo the next
                            few days in New York and would discuss it with them. He added that he

                            subsequently the Fulbright Amendment to the Defense Procurement Act has
                            given rise to a new problem with regard to the Thai-in-North Laos
                            proposal. The Fulbright Amendment would in effect prohibit use of <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> funds for Thai troops in Laos except
                            for <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0242"/>those associated with
                            interdiction of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> infiltration to

                            has advised Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> and
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> that
                            this would permit <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> funding of Thai
                            troops in South Laos but would not cover those in the North. <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believes there is an outside chance
                            that it would be acceptable legally for <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> funds to continue to be used for this purpose in North
                            Laos and, if so, the two projects could both go forward. All that would
                            be required is a shifting of funds to put the Thai <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s in the South under <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> funding and those in the North under
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, for which Bill Wells assures us
                            their funds would be adequate. However, the legal authority for this is
                            extremely shaky and I believe it would be hazardous to proceed without a
                            green light from the Hill.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile, it does not seem advisable to commence talks with the
                            Thai on the South Laos project independently. To do so would inevitably
                            open the question as to our intentions with respect to North Laos, where
                            we and the Thai will soon have to make important decisions about the
                            future of <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SR1"
                                >SR</gloss>–IX. As you recall, one reason for shifting to <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s in North Laos was to put all Thai
                            forces in that country on the same footing with regard to command and
                            control and pay and allowances. While we would like to keep the two
                            projects separate for planning purposes here, we agree with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> that it would be unwise
                            to start talking with the Thai about the South before we are prepared to
                            talk about the North as well.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that this problem be brought up at the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting scheduled for next Tuesday

                        <p>1. This memorandum constitutes my report to you on my 7–22 October 1970
                            trip to Southeast Asia. On this trip, I had three major objectives.</p>
                        <p>a. To survey the situation in Indochina and Thailand at first hand and to

                            through personal observation augmented by direct conversations with

                        <p>25. Thailand. Though Thailand is not technically part of Indochina, the
                            Thai are directly involved in the Indochina struggle and Thailand's
                            leaders are deeply concerned about its outcome. Not surprisingly, this
                            concern is viewed through the prism of what its leaders regard as
                            Thailand's <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0244"/>own vital interests,
                            and these tend to focus on Laos. There the Thai are particularly
                            concerned about the trans-Mekong border provinces of Sayaboury,
                            Champassak and Sithadone. These provinces used to belong to Thailand, a
                            fact that lends a strong emotional coloration to the views of the Thai
                            leaders, who feel that Vietnamese Communist control over any Lao
                            territory on the west bank of the Mekong would be tantamount to an
                            invasion of Thailand. The King made this clear in our conversation when
                            he pointed out that France had deliberately wrested these three
                            provinces from Thai control in the 19th century in order to point “a
                            dagger at our heart.” General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                                >Praphat</persName> and other senior Thai leaders expressed similar
                            sentiments. This attitude about the border provinces obviously colors
                            the whole Thai approach to the utilization and disposition of Thai
                            regular and irregular forces in Laos, including the Thai-Khmer
                            Volunteers and the Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s. The Thai
                            want to make sure that Sayaboury, Champassak and Sithadone are
                            adequately protected before they discuss use of Thai resources in other
                            areas of Laos which they consider of less immediately urgent importance
                            to Thailand itself.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">In paragraph 35 of his

                        <p>26. While the Thai welcome the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> doctrine, they are inclined to interpret it quite
                            literally. Believing that they have already done much to aid us in
                            providing bases in Thailand, sending troops openly to Vietnam, and
                            deploying them [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in Laos, the Thai feel that if they provide the
                            human resources for additional activities against North Vietnam, the
                            material and economic costs of raising and supporting these assets
                            should be borne by the United States. Their bargaining position is
                            framed accordingly. But the Thai do recognize that this is a common
                            struggle and are far from indifferent to its outcome. They are convinced
                            that a North Vietnamese victory in Indochina would leave them boxed on
                            the north and east by borders under hostile Communist control, Chinese
                            or Vietnamese. Under such circumstances, they feel that external support
                            to the already troublesome but presently manageable insurgency threat
                            within Thailand would rise sharply and the Thai government would find
                            itself faced with serious internal problems. [<hi rend="italic">less

                            officials with whom I talked believe that in such an eventuality, the
                            whole political complexion of Thailand and her international posture
                            would promptly change to a left-leaning neutralism.</p>

                        <p>27. Barring a North Vietnamese victory in the Indochina struggle,
                            however, U.S. officials believe that Thai politics will probably
                            continue on their current course without radical change. <persName

                        <p>Dear Len:</p>
                        <p>You will recall that when I was in Bangkok you suggested that it would be
                            helpful for me to write you to give you the benefit of the President's
                            thinking on issues of concern to you. In this light, I am passing on the
                            President's interest in doing everything that we can to assure that
                            third-country assistance to Cambodia is made available. He has issued
                            specific directives concerning Thai air and ground actions in Cambodia
                            if the need should arise.</p>
                        <p>First, the President wants everything possible to be done prior to the
                            end of the rainy season to mobilize our own and third-country assistance
                                <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0246"/>to Cambodia to enable that
                            country to survive an anticipated intensification in North Vietnamese
                            attacks after the rains. He communicated this personally to senior
                            officials of the Government in a meeting last June.</p>
                        <p>Second, the President has now directed that contingency plans be prepared
                            for employment of Thai air and ground forces in the event of an <gloss
                                target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            offensive in Cambodia when the dry season begins. These might include:
                            (a) the stationing of Thai forces along the Thai-Cambodia border in
                            preparation for deployment in Cambodia, (b) use of Thai air support in
                            Cambodia up to 900 sorties per month, to include areas beyond the
                            present 30 kilometer zone agreed to by the Cambodians, (c) use of the
                            Black Leopard units redeployed from South Vietnam as appropriate, and
                            (d) provision of U.S. funding and matériel support for the Thai
                            deployments including the use, as appropriate, of trade-off economic
                            programs. These plans are to be completed and submitted to the
                            Washington Special Actions Group for review no later than November
                            5.</p>
                        <p>Third, the President has further directed that the United States
                            Ambassadors in Bangkok and Phnom Penh be instructed that the development
                            of contingency plans to match our own by the Governments of Thailand and
                            Cambodia be given their high priority attention.</p>
                        <p>I have the impression that we may have misled you in some of the cables
                            which we sent to you by giving you a welter of technical details which
                            obscured the imperative nature of the President's concerns. I want to
                            assure you that he considers the situation in Cambodia to be extremely
                            urgent, and wants all of us concerned to bend every effort to see that
                            the assistance which Cambodia may need shortly on an emergency basis
                            will be provided. This of course requires full understanding on the part
                            of our Thai and Cambodian allies as to our thinking and as to the kinds
                            of support which we are prepared to offer. There should be nothing left
                            undone either by them or by us which actions on our part could have
                            avoided.</p>

                            points to which we would call your attention are that the <gloss

                            assisting in the training of 14 Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>'s (13 infantry and one artillery), of which two are to be

                        <p>The availability timing is determined by factors of recruiting and
                            training. A twelve week training program is planned for all except the

                            understand that there are about 2200 volunteers already signed up who
                            will man the next batch of six <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s. So
                            far as we know, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> does not yet

                        <p>Initially, there appears to have been a problem in recruitment. The

                            with previous military experience and other high qualifications, but
                            apparently were not very successful on the basis of the pay and
                            allowance scale initially proposed. Recent negotiations in Bangkok [<hi

                            problem can be resolved by establishing an additional training facility,
                            and the matter is under negotiation through <gloss

                            General Surakij returns from his present visit to Australia.</p>

                                >Sierra Romeo</gloss> now in Laos. We have been told, however, that
                            in negotiations with the Thai it is being made clear that those forces
                            will not be removed from Laos until the <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>'s, fully trained and equipped, are ready to replace

                        <p>In general, the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> training program is
                            not split in terms of future assignments to north or south Laos.
                            However, it is understood that the first two battalions, the <gloss
                                target="#t_TKV1">TKV</gloss>, will go to Champassak/Sithadone and
                            that the highest priority for the next batch will be Sayaboury. The
                            reason for Sayaboury's priority is that the Thai cadre for Project
                            Sayavong are being drawn down for the <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss> program and the Thai feel that an <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalion should be sent in to fill the
                            vacuum. Deployment of the rest of the <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>'s will be determined by circumstances at the time their

                        <p>Dear <persName>Marshall</persName>:</p>

                        <p>I agree that the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] role in Thai counterinsurgency operations should

                            />advice designed to improve Thai institutional capabilities to deal
                            with this problem. This principle, I assure you, is reflected in the
                            Mission <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> Guidelines and governs our
                            activities here. I am particularly alert to this principle because of my
                            testimony before the Symington Committee when I assured the Committee
                            that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> personnel do not participate in
                            counterinsurgency operations in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>The importance of adhering to this principle has been repeatedly reviewed
                            with the senior personnel [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>], and I have stressed the need to err on
                            the conservative side in such matters. On the other hand, I want to be
                            very careful that in the interests of maintaining this principle we do
                            not imbue [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] personnel with a frame of mind and attitude that
                            becomes too restrictive and unintentionally limits their performance in
                            their advisory role with the Thais [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>From time to time it will probably be necessary [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] to undertake
                            specific [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] operations within general program approvals that
                            I have given them to satisfy requirements that have been levied by
                            Washington. Such operations may become involved with some aspect of the
                            counterinsurgency effort of the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>.
                            When this type of situation can be foreseen I have asked [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            to bring these specific operations to my attention so that I can
                            determine whether we should go beyond the role we have set for ourselves
                            in the counterinsurgency field.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I wish to assure you that I have and will continue to do my
                            utmost to see that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] agencies leave the initiative in the
                            counterinsurgency field to the Thais and that our activities here are
                            such that there is no question in anyone's mind about our
                            non-involvement in Thai counterinsurgency operations.</p>

                        <p>Dear Alex,</p>
                        <p>The recent bombing of North Vietnam targets by <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> aircraft is yet another in a series of cases that found
                            me totally unprepared to tell the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                            anything about operations from Thai bases involving a significant
                            departure from existing policies and practices as they know them. While
                            fully appreciating the sensitivity of the subject, I strongly feel that
                            my inability to communicate some of this information—at least at the top
                            level—has prevented me from discharging commitments and responsibilities
                            to the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> that form an important part
                            of the arrangements <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0252"/>and
                            understandings under which <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces were
                            permitted to operate from Thai bases. Initially, you will recall, they
                            asked for advance information on our operations. Our present arrangement
                            of giving them post-strike summaries is predicated on the assumption
                            that we will keep them informed of unusual operations, especially when
                            the deviation from established practice has political dimensions of
                            interest to the Thai.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a brief list of Thai-based operations<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d99fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> that took place
                            this year without our knowing in advance or being able to inform the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> except after the fact.</p>
                        <p>As far as last weekend's strikes against North Vietnam are concerned,
                            despite my urgent inquiry to Washington,<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3"

                            to offer the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> any information about
                            the involvement of Thai-based <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            resources beyond what had already appeared in the papers. The Prime
                            Minister's first question when I introduced General Clay was about this
                            operation. Had <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> been
                            present, he would surely have probed more deeply and perhaps gotten off
                            one of his barbs about our failure to consult. To compound the problem,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s November 23
                            statement about the helicopter rescue operation (which I was instructed
                            to convey urgently) was sent only Priority, did not arrive here until
                            after lunch, and could not be conveyed before the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> read it in the afternoon papers. In
                            view of today's press stories that the helicopters used Thai bases, we
                            may yet have some inquiries about this one.</p>
                        <p>I strongly feel that the requirement to keep the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> fully informed on operations of Thai-based aircraft is
                            fundamental to the smooth conduct of air operations from Thai bases. It
                            has a direct bearing on the continuation of the operational freedom we
                            have enjoyed here and which I presume it is desirable to maintain.</p>
                        <p>I know you will share my growing concern over these disturbing episodes
                            and hope you will find opportunities to take them up at appropriate
                            levels in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, perhaps by drawing

                                for themselves, I feel that we should no longer necessarily expect
                                the same degree of Thai complaisance in our use of bases in
                                Thailand.” (Ibid.)</note> and <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Tom

                            the need for operational secrecy, I believe our policy of dealing out
                            the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> (whose <pb n="204"

                            is short-sighted and someday may boomerang. Informing the RTG after the
                            fact, and then only incompletely, simply will not do!</p>

                            contribute a fair share of the $140 million estimated food aid
                            requirement for the 15-month period ending March 31, 1971. This
                            assistance is still considered vital not only for its direct impact in
                            conserving foreign exchange and stabilizing prices but also because of
                            the local currency generated for support of the development program.
                            Although Indonesia had anticipated that the United States would provide
                            up to 450,000 tons of rice and had in fact requested a greater quantity,
                            the total to be provided is not expected to exceed 400,000 tons. This
                            would include 240,000 tons from the April agreement, the proposed sale
                            of 110,000 and a possible additional 50,000 tons early next year. Any
                            delay in arrival of <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> rice beyond
                            March 1971 would fail to accord with understandings reached at the
                            December 1969 <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the suggestion that the United States buy Thai rice as has
                            been done by Japan, it is regretted that this would not be feasible in
                            view of availabilities of United States rice and the United States
                            balance of payments considerations. It is understandable that Japan,
                            which has a large surplus in its bilateral payments with Thailand,
                            should wish to find measures to ease this imbalance. On the other hand,
                            the United States is still a net contributor to Thailand's balance of
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>Although the assistance provided by the various countries has helped to
                            improve the situation following the serious financial strains which led
                            to formation of the international assistance group in 1966, Indonesian
                            recovery and development requires that foreign exchange resources
                            allocated to food purchases be kept to a minimum. However, as a result
                            of this assistance Indonesia has had the resources to purchase
                            commercially on the average as much or more rice than was possible in
                            1965 when no rice imports were obtained under the United States <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> program. In supplementing
                            Indonesia's resources and enabling them to continue to make commercial
                            purchases of rice as well as other vital commodities this Government
                            believes that the program, on the whole, has been helpful rather than
                            harmful to Thailand.</p>

                                had only partly “gotten” the President's desires with respect to the
                                Thai helping out in Cambodia. Rather, he noted that <persName

                                his own ideas first, notably in trying to focus upon the
                                counterinsurgency requirements in Thailand as first priority. He
                                probably shares the general State view that ‘Thai troops should
                                serve in Thailand,’ as well as State's concerns over possible U.S.
                                military involvement along with the Thai via our <gloss

                                favors direct U.S. military assistance to Thailand in support of

                            many months he had the strong impression that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>'s colleagues wanted the Thai
                            troops to stay in Thailand, especially in the Northeast, and not get in
                            trouble in Cambodia. Somehow, by hook or crook, Thai units intended for
                            Cambodia would disappear. Because Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> probably didn't know the origins of the interest
                            here in having the Thai prepared to go into Cambodia, he, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, wanted to provide some of
                            the background. He had to deal with the President, who would repeatedly
                            telephone about this. One evening the President had called about the two
                            regiments of Thai regulars which were supposed to be a strategic
                            reserve, and said that he wanted them in Cambodia. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that he had then gone
                            back to the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> to say that these
                            regiments should be sent in.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0256"/>
                        <p>He happened to be a member of the school of thought, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued, which believed
                            that a Presidential order should be carried out. He referred to the
                            complicated sequence of events involving the two regiments of Thai
                            regulars which were supposed to go into Cambodia, the forces which were
                            to be sent from Thailand to Vietnam to free units of the Thai forces in
                            Vietnam for service in Cambodia, and then the plan to train two
                            regiments of Thai/Khmer volunteers. We had ended up with no Thai
                            regulars in Cambodia, no units sent to Vietnam, and no Thai/Khmer
                            regiments. Ultimately, the Thai decision was to pull out from Vietnam,
                            leaving nothing in reserve. This had not looked like the most
                            enthusiastic compliance with the President's orders.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that Thai
                            military planning now appeared to be coming along satisfactorily.
                            However, if the occasion ever arose for the Thai to move, we should give
                            the impression that we were really behind them rather than engaging in
                            discussions over the details of our aid. This would give them the wrong
                            impression. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> said
                            that he felt our negotiations with the Thai on support were now
                            proceeding satisfactorily, and that if we could carry these negotiations
                            through we would have Thai units prepared and in place ready to move out
                            for operations in Cambodia this dry season. Nevertheless, if the Thai
                            went into Cambodia we would have a big financial problem in paying for
                            the ordnance (bombs and ammunition), <gloss target="#t_POL1"
                            >POL</gloss>, and other supplies which the Thai would need. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> added that nobody had
                            told him where these funds were to come from. He assumed that Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> probably remembered
                            the last frank message from Bangkok in which he had pointed out these
                            difficulties. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked
                            if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> had suggested
                            any solutions, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> replied that he hadn't offered any because he had
                            been knocked down on using Thai <gloss target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss>,
                            and had also been informed that Cambodian <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> was unavailable because it was overcommitted. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that the
                            situation as to Cambodia <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> was now
                            remedied by the supplemental appropriation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> stated that he
                            wanted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to know his,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>'s, thinking. When the
                            question of the Thai operating in Cambodia through South Vietnam had
                            arisen, he had thought this was a great solution. However, it had been
                            knocked down somewhere in Washington. The question was apparently how
                            deeply into Cambodia the Thai should operate. The Thai had been ready to
                            go, but somebody back here had killed the idea. He understood that it
                            had been knocked out as a practicable possibility over the issue of how
                            funds could be used, and also because of the possibility of
                            Congressional flak. With respect to the Thai/Khmer idea the question was
                            where the money would come from when the troops moved into Cambodia.
                            Funds couldn't come from Thai <gloss target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss>, or
                            from Cambodia <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> either (although this
                            might now be changed).</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> explained that
                            the situation he had just described was why he had jumped on the <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> idea for using trained people—the two
                                <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions formed out of the
                            Thai/Khmer volunteers—against the <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName> trail. He understood that these units had just taken
                            off from Korat for commitment to the Bolovens. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>'s opinion of the capability of
                            these troops, to which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> replied that the units ought to be good because
                            they had been well-trained. Because of this, the judgment had been made
                            to put them into the Bolovens area, but we wouldn't know until later how
                            well they would do. Thai troops were good on the defensive, although not
                            so good on the offensive. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> cited Thai regulars in North Laos as an example of
                            effective Thai performance on the defensive, noting that although they
                            had recently been hit very hard and had suffered substantial casualties,
                            they had held very well. He believed that the situation in the Bolovens
                            was also one in which the Thai would do well. <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>s were a better kind of unit than the regulars, since
                            they were more mobile. He hoped to see all the Thai troops in Laos
                            eventually put into the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> mode, with
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> pulled back. It could also help
                            defend Long Tieng and Sam Thong. Going back to the South Laos picture,
                            if all went well and the situation didn't get out of hand, we would work
                            out a smooth transition for putting in <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that he was
                            willing to go along with this since we had an assessment that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s were as good as the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>. The Joint Chiefs did not think so.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> remarked that
                            the test would come soon in the South.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> why the
                            Department of State was so interested in <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                                >SGU</gloss>s instead of Thai regulars. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> replied that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> had told him that the Thai
                            could not have their soldiers fighting side by side at different rates
                            of pay, and that types of units and pay scales should be standardized.
                            In addition, the Thai were hesitant to put in <gloss target="#t_RCT1"
                                >RCT</gloss>s except in places where they could be covered up. This
                            was so as to avoid the appearance of violating the Geneva Accords.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> observed that
                            his own conclusion was that the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                            were preferable because they cost less and were more suitable for the
                            type of fighting involved. Did Washington feel that the cost was an
                            important factor?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that what the
                            President wanted was success— he wouldn't care about an additional $10
                            million if success was assured. There was a school here which
                            interpreted the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine as
                            favoring a semi-neutralist Thailand. This was a brilliant theory, except
                            for the fact that it didn't meet the President's ideas. The President
                            did not want to encourage a semi-neutralist Thailand, or a defeat in
                            Laos. When the chips were down, Thai regulars would be pulled in <pb
                                n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0258"/>anyway. The President wanted
                            reports on what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                            believed, not reports on what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> believed conformed with the views of the White
                            House. We then would proceed to give definite instructions. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that
                            every once in a while Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> should sum up what he really thought for his, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s, use.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> reiterated the
                            belief that over the long run <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s were
                            the better deal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said that he had no brief for the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                            over the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>s except that we knew that
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> had worked in North Laos. What
                            we would do was to put the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s in when
                            they were trained, which would be at the beginning of the rainy season.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> told Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that he would so
                            inform <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>, who wouldn't
                            simply pull out the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> but would keep
                            it there in order to maintain his assets. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that this was very
                            important.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> said that the
                            Thai were not planning to put an <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>
                            into South Laos, to which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> commented that he did not see the need for an
                                <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> where one was not already in
                            place. In the Long Tieng situation we had waited a long time after being
                            told the Thai regulars were needed before deciding to go ahead. The
                            President had made the decision, which obviously had made all the
                            difference. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                            mentioned that he had no complaint over this decision, only over the
                            fact that he had not been brought in on all of the preliminary
                            communications. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            explained that back channel messages had been used only because we had
                            wanted to make sure before hand that the Thai were willing to go. There
                            was no sense here that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> was doing anything but loyally carrying out his
                            instructions. The difficulty was in making sure that the President's
                            policy and wishes filtered through.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> noted that there
                            were misunderstandings among the Thai, too. He was now speaking to them
                            on an entirely different basis from what he had been saying two years
                            ago. Nevertheless, the Thai understood the Congressional problem, and
                            knew that what Congress said was not necessarily the President's policy.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed
                            understanding of the difficulties the Thai faced, recalling some of the
                            problems which the President's advance men had caused prior to the
                            President's trip last year.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> declared that in
                            our relations with the Thai we should not overlook small but important
                            issues such as the Son Tay raid. The aircraft involved had all taken off
                            from Thai bases, but he had been given absolutely nothing which he could
                            pass along to the Thai about this. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that the problem here did not lie with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> or himself, but
                            was due to the fact that when the decision had been made Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had not agreed to a
                                <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0259"/>suggestion from him that
                            others in State such as Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> should be brought
                            in. He personally had been prohibited from talking, and had called
                            Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> over against orders to tell him
                            about the raid while it was in progress. This was of course too late,
                            and we should have had Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> talking to the Thai about that same time.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> asserted that
                            even an hour of advance notice would have been helpful. Only today, with
                            the help of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, he
                            had gotten Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> to
                            clear an anodyne message which could be given to the Thai.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                            mentioned that there were two issues which caused him considerable
                            concern: first, the matter of close-in air support for the Thai if they
                            went into Cambodia, and second the matter of our longer term commitment
                            to Thailand under these circumstances and the relationship of the Thai
                            actions to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that these were
                            important issues, and instructed Mr. Holdridge to see that they would be
                            put before the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> for
                            consideration.</p>

                            support issue to Mr. Holdridge, saying that he believed the Thai air
                            resources were inadequate to maintain the authorized sortie rate of 900
                            per month, and that in any event the Thai had no real experience in
                            providing the kind of close-in support which might be necessary in
                            Cambodia. There was also the related matter of how to provide logistical
                            support.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Thailand's long-standing security concerns have been compounded by
                            Communist aggression in Cambodia. However, initial Thai receptivity to
                            sweeping requests for assistance from <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                                Nol</persName> was tempered not only by reserved response by U.S.
                            concerning support, but <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0260"/>also by
                            serious assessment of their priorities and capabilities in light of
                            existing troop commitments in Vietnam and Laos and requirements to meet
                            mounting insurgency problems at home. Moreover, after it became evident
                            that <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> ground combat presence would
                            raise number of touchy issues (including command and control),
                            Cambodians indicated to Thai that there was no immediate requirement for
                            their troops and Cambodians also limited that airforce operations, thus
                            reducing number of sorties <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> could
                            fly in support of Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>2. In response Washington directives to discuss with Thai measures to
                            meet dry season emergency in Cambodia, we and Thai costed out their
                            contingency plan for western Cambodia (Chakri Plan). We have recommended
                            to Washington our moving ahead at this time only with package of
                            readiness measures drawn from Chakri Plan for: <gloss target="#t_RTAF1"
                                >RTAF</gloss> operations of 900 sorties per month; preparing five
                            regiments for combat; command and control; and activating reserve
                            division. Total one-time costs of these packages would be about $36
                            million to achieve readiness; continuing O&amp;M and personnel costs to
                            maintain readiness would be $1.6 million per month. We would not intend
                            to finance personnel costs of these packages and Thai have agreed in
                            principle to assume them. One-time personnel costs are $2.66 million and
                            continuing personnel costs are $1.8 million per month.</p>
                        <p>3. While consideration has been given to deploying Black Leopard units
                            returning from <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> to Cambodia, if
                            requested by Cambodia, this is not practicable since Black Leopards
                            cease to exist as units shortly after returning to Thailand; about 40
                            percent of the personnel are volunteers for Vietnam and under the law
                            must be released from active duty in accordance with their contracts;
                            the other 60 percent (<gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> regulars)
                            normally return to their former units, and are badly needed there to
                            bring forces up to acceptable strength levels.</p>
                        <p>4. Pending an answer from Washington on our recommendation (see para 2
                            above), we have not resumed dialogue on readiness measures with Thai. We
                            expect Thai will take occasion of <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1"
                                >SecDef</gloss> visit to inquire into status of project (which was

                            Cambodia. Thai may also raise questions about U.S. support if in fact
                            deployment to Cambodia should be required. This would include our help
                            with logistics and air support as well as with greatly expanded costs
                            for material in actual combat conditions.</p>

                                >US</gloss> mission reps, Thai leaders stressed following: their
                            support for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and
                            Vietnamization, but concern that success of latter may be gravely
                            impaired by continued enemy capability mount threat in Laos and
                            Cambodia; recognition that <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> nations
                            must make growing contribution to their own defense, especially in
                            manpower; determination to assume full responsibility for their defense
                            needs without <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops, but requirement
                            for continuation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military
                            assistance; need for helicopters, ammo, <gloss target="#t_T281"
                                >T–28</gloss>'s and excess equipment that can be used to develop
                            Thai forces; rice problem (reported Bangkok 276)<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d104fn2">Telegram 276 from Bangkok, January 8, noted that
                                “Thai leaders (especially <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>) made impassioned plea
                                to <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss> for U.S.
                                reconsideration of <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> rice
                                shipments to Thailand's traditional markets.” It noted that Deputy
                                Prime Minister and Minister for National Development <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PS5">Pote Sarasin</persName> told <persName

                                cutting into Thailand's most important source of income. This
                                applied especially to Indonesia which normally buys Thai rice. If
                                U.S. were to compete in open market and at a fair price, the Thai
                                would not mind, but <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> sales
                                not made under competitive conditions.” (Ibid., <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine (including
                            assurance of continued regular military assistance and fullest
                            exploitation of excess program), stressed need for regional cooperation
                            and will of regional countries to make effective use of their resources.
                            In response to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s expressed
                            doubts whether the administration will be able to carry out the programs
                            underpinning the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine,
                            Secretary explained importance of recent vote of defense appropriations
                            and stated his conviction that President will get the support to carry
                            through his program. Thai leaders did not seek additional meeting,
                            evidently feeling that they got their main problems off their chests.
                            End summary.</p>

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> opened with brief review of
                            instances of Thai cooperation with free world (Korea, Laos, <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, basing of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces in Thailand). He expressed full support for
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and
                            understanding for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop reductions,
                            but argued that these reductions be planned carefully, taking into
                            account assessments of communist strength and action. Communist threat
                            to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> was still great as the small
                            countries here were developing their own defenses while simultaneously
                            trying to improve living standards. All sea nations should bear
                            responsibility for their own defense, but continued substantial <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance was required. Concept of
                            Vietnamization should be broadened to “Southeast-Asianization.”</p>
                        <p>4. In commenting on implications of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            troop withdrawals, Thai leaders several times stressed danger that as
                            war in Vietnam winds down, threat to Laos and Cambodia (and thus to
                            Thailand) could well increase. In their view, success of Vietnamization
                            depended on how well the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could manage
                            situation in Laos and Cambodia. Thanks to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and other <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            assistance, Cambodia had resisted much better than anticipated, but
                            “some sort of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> guard must be
                            maintained; otherwise Vietnamization will fall flat” (<persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>). Saigon was still the enemy's
                            principal target, but he is now attempting to get at it through Laos
                            (where he is building up <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s in the
                            panhandle) and Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary several times stressed theme of regional cohesion,
                            coordination and self-help. Enemy capabilities and intentions are not
                            the only factors being considered in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            troop reductions; willingness and capability of our friends to use their
                            energies effectively and well were also very important. <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces were now much larger and more
                            capable while enemy capabilities had declined since 1968. Secretary said
                            in applying <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine we
                            will give as much help as possible; while we are terminating our combat
                            role, we will continue other important roles such as air, logistic and
                            artillery support; we not fully withdrawing now, but only reducing and
                            cutting back particularly in our direct involvement in combat.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary made several inquiries about the insurgency, most of which
                            brought little substantive response; <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                                >Dawee</persName> stated however, government was successful in
                            keeping insurgents from moving into villages, but Hanoi-trained Meo were
                            operating in several provinces in the north; particularly disturbing
                            aspect of the trouble in the mid-south was that the terrorists were
                            ethnic Thai. Recent operations by 700 young <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214"

                                >Dawee</persName> rejected term kmt) in the process of resettlement
                            in the north had resulted in discovery of larger ct forces stores and
                            facilities than had been anticipated, including a 300–500 man reception
                            center for trainees and infiltrators from <gloss target="#t_NVN1"
                                >NVN</gloss> and Laos. Throughout the meeting, <gloss

                                >Dawee</persName>, and also <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> stressed that Thailand wants to take care of its
                            own defenses; it will do its own fighting and wants no <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces (presumably <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> ground combat troops); but it needs <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> material support to subdue threat before
                            it is too late. Secretary said he got the message on <gloss

                            apply to Cambodia as well.</p>
                        <p>7. Thai made strong plea for excess equipment left behind by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces. Secretary explained legal
                            requirements for transfer of excess items; if <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> could meet necessary criteria it would have priority on
                            excess items located in country. Secretary stated that increase in
                            military assistance effort was important aspect of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and that excess program
                            offered in some ways better vehicle than direct appropriation; Thai
                            should identify their needs and explain how they proposed to use items
                            so one could move ahead with excess program.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to Secretary's query re <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss>'s assessment of possibility arriving at some sort of
                            arrangement with <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> as result recent
                            Thai contacts with <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> Red Cross
                            repatriation delegation, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                            stated that talks had not yielded any results. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Note</hi>: In context Secretary's query he presumably referred to
                            political results, not question whether some repatriation may in fact
                            take place.) <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said only one
                            member of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> team was bona fide Red
                            Cross; others were intelligence types. He interpreted <gloss
                                target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> initiative largely as probing action.
                            Even though several subjects, including POWs, had been touched upon,
                            there had been no real communication or signal.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said in his personal
                            opinion <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> were using Paris Talks as
                            propaganda forum and no results should be expected there. To the <gloss
                                target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, the real meaning of Vietnamization is
                            how long the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> can stand behind <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, since they are confident of their
                            ability to dispose of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> once <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> departs scene. Referring to situation in
                            Laos and Cambodia, he expressed doubt whether successful implementation
                            of Vietnamization in 1972 was possible unless situation those two
                            counties could be contained; despite expressed intention of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his administration,
                            he was not certain whether in light of Congressional opposition these
                            measures could be taken and whether American people were really behind
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>10. Secretary stressed legislative debate was often misunderstood,
                            misinterpreted and misrepresented; he pointed out that though
                            Vietnamization was first major thrust of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine, it was only small part of it and should
                            not be taken in isolation. He then explained importance <pb n="215"
                                xml:id="pg_215" facs="0264"/>of recent positive Senate vote on
                            defense appropriations, stressing administration had done well on every
                            test vote. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> conceded recent
                            success but insisted there will continue to be opposition to President's
                            program. Secretary said he thought President meant what he said.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> briefly referred to Thai
                            defense plan (Chakri), saying that costing exercise carried on with help
                            of <gloss target="#t_MACTHAI1">MacThai</gloss> had demonstrated
                            tremendous defense costs which Thailand unable to bear with its limited
                            resources. Secretary said he aware of planning effort which now being
                            considered in Washington in light of this back to <gloss

                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> planning for a new division in 1973
                            which meant equipment requirements being developed now. Thai needed
                            helicopters to replace combat attrition; they were running ammo war
                            reserve down to dangerously low level due to high expenditure rates in
                            Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand; and speed-up of <gloss target="#t_T281"
                                >T–28</gloss> delivery would be most desirable. (Secretary held out
                            no hope that this last was possible). <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                                >Dawee</persName> stressed <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>
                            purchase of OV–10s as example of Thai modernization effort without

                        <p>13. Bangkok press Jan. 8–9 gave frontpage coverage to Secretary's visit.
                            Stories highlighted his references to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>The meeting was convened at 10:55 a.m. in the President's Oval Office so
                            that the President and his principal advisors could hear a personal
                            report from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> and
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> on their trip to
                            Thailand and South Vietnam with stop enroute in Paris.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion of the professional football championship game
                            (Superbowl) which took place the preceding day, the President asked
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> to provide the
                            group with a report on his trip to Southeast Asia and Paris.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Paris Peace Talks.]</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> then stated that
                            in Thailand his team had met with all of the principal Thai leaders and
                            had participated in a dinner and an extensive after-dinner working
                            session. The Thais made the following points to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>:</p>
                        <p>—They complained bitterly about U.S. <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL
                                480</gloss> rice sales to Indonesia and other Thai market areas.
                            (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> said that he
                            avoided substantive comment.)</p>
                        <p>—Thai officials were not as concerned about the counterinsurgency problem
                            in Northeast Thailand as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> thought they should be. (The Secretary stated that
                            two large insurgent base camps had been developed in Northeast Thailand,
                            with the most serious problem being the camp located at the projected
                            end of the Chinese road complex.) </p>
                        <p>—The Thais asked for assurances of continued U.S. military assistance,
                            emphasizing they wished us to maintain our bases in Thailand but that
                            they would have no need for U.S. ground power.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> that his past discussions with the Thais suggested
                            that they were very much concerned about internal insurgency. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> replied that the threat
                            had <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0266"/>actually increased over the
                            past 12 months and that the Thais had few forces involved in this
                            role.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that if the Thais fell we would be in deep
                            difficulty because of our treaty arrangements and, therefore, we will
                            have to push them on the insurgency issue. More importantly, we are
                            going to have to assure that they get all the military assistance in
                            terms of equipment and funds that they need. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that an additional
                            problem was the fact that the Thais have forces in Laos and that while
                            the insurgency in the Northeast may be a problem, the viability of Laos
                            and Cambodia is the decisive factor in terms of Thailand's future. It is
                            essential that they not pull their forces out of Laos.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented that he had been encouraged by the recent
                            report on the performance of Thai forces in Laos.<note n="2"

                                    <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> a message, in
                                telegram 6319 to Bangkok, January 14, stating that “I want you to
                                know how impressed I have been with the performance of the Thai
                                personnel who are assisting the Lao in the common defense interests
                                of Laos and Thailand, first in successful actions at Long Tieng and
                                Sam Thong, then at Ban Na and now at Ban Houay Sai. I wish in
                                particular to commend the irregular forces at Ban Houay Sai who
                                recently inflicted very heavy casualties on three regular North
                                Vietnamese battalions with the loss of only one Thai.” (Ibid.,

                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> THAI–US)</note> Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> stated that this was
                            the first <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalion that had been
                            formed by the Thais. He noted that the conduct of the battle was well
                            executed by the Thais, who permitted the enemy to get inside their
                            positions and then inflicted great damage on them.</p>
                        <p>The President then remarked that he had recently read an excellent press
                            story on Cambodia and that these were the kinds of stories which would
                            insure the proper attitude in the U.S. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"
                                >Helms</persName> stated that the Cambodians have certainly
                            demonstrated an outstanding will but that now their requirement was to
                            learn how to operate their forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> reopened the
                            question of insurgency in Thailand and asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> to comment on the seriousness.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied that action
                            programs are initiated each year with the anticipation that they will
                            succeed but that at the end of the period it always appears that there
                            has been further deterioration. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> indicated that he had raised this issue on three
                            separate occasions with the Thais but that they had appeared to want to
                            avoid the issue. The President then reiterated that because of our
                            treaty commitments, it was important not to permit the situation to
                            deteriorate. He directed that necessary spending be undertaken now
                            rather than to find ourselves involved in another massive insurgency in
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> stated that he
                            sensed the need by the Thais for continual hand-holding with respect to
                            our presence in Thailand and our <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0267"
                            />assistance program. For this reason, the Secretary provided additional
                            assurances to the Thai leadership. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> added that we have already cut our forces by
                            16,000 in Thailand and that further reductions should be avoided. He
                            expressed special concern about the retention of our naval base and the
                            air base at Utopa.</p>
                        <p>The President confirmed that he wanted our bases retained in Thailand.
                            The slight draw-downs accomplished thus far were acceptable but the
                            bases must be retained. The President stated that the Thais have always
                            needed constant reassurances and suggested that it might be of value to
                            include a visit by the King on this year's state visit schedule.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> interjected that
                            he agreed that this would be a good idea.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that specific assurances should be given to the
                            Thais after our next troop withdrawal announcement. He pointed out that
                            the Symington Subcommittee hearings had done great damage to our overall
                            relationships with the Thais and that this damage had to be rectified.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> remarked that the
                            Thai Foreign Minister was the principal problem in Thailand. The
                            Secretary had emphasized to the Prime Minister that the supplemental
                            vote in the U.S. Congress represented a major victory for those who
                            supported strong U.S./Thai relations.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he wanted it clearly understood that the U.S.
                            was on a razor's edge with respect to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine in Southeast Asia. While we have made our
                            policy clear, the press has consistently distorted it to our
                            disadvantage. The President stressed that we must retain our presence in
                            Thailand, and in all Southeast Asia, to include the Philippines, South
                            Vietnam and Korea. The idea that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine constituted a formula for reducing our
                            presence to zero was neither true nor in our interest. The President
                            emphasized that it was important that we reassure our allies in this
                            respect. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> remarked
                            that military assistance was the essential element since our Asian
                            allies have the manpower resources.</p>
                        <p>In continuing his discourse on our relationships with our allies, the
                            President stated that this same philosophy applied worldwide. That was
                            why Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC5">Percy</persName> had been so much
                            in error. We need a continued presence in Europe and in terms of our
                            worldwide position, we cannot permit ourselves to slip into a weak
                            conventional force posture. We need a strong conventional posture
                            abroad. We should now be thinking about permanent U.S./Asian and
                            European force deployments. Our Soviet and Chinese friends watch this
                            issue intensely and they draw great comfort and attach great
                            significance to reductions in our force levels abroad.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> remarked that we
                            have to sell this issue to the American people. He commented that a 11/2
                            war strategy was not <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0268"/>saleable
                            but rather we should sell it on the grounds of a realistic deterrent
                            consisting of adequate conventional, tactical nuclear and nuclear
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that Congressional proponents were the first to
                            complain when we cut bases here in the U.S. if they involved their
                            constituents. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> stated it
                            was obvious that the Thais must have continued reassurance from us and
                            that they had already started to refurbish their lines with the Chinese
                            Communists. The President restated that we should bring the Thai King on
                            a visit to the U.S. The President instructed Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>, Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, as appropriate, to bring
                            Senators in and to talk about the importance of Thailand and the need to
                            avoid future hearings such as those conducted by Senator Symington.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> commented that he
                            was convinced the situation in the Foreign Relations Committee was now a
                            great deal better. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> added that the Committee was now obviously split
                            and that the Son Tay operation had been largely responsible for this.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> stated that the
                            Department of State was also breakfasting with members of the Committee
                            and that this had improved communications immeasurably. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> remarked that the
                            Department of Defense was also working with the Committee on a regular
                            basis.</p>

                        <p>1. I made presentation to Prime Minister this afternoon following closely
                            reftel A. PriMin was accompanied by <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1"
                                >FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> and Minister in Prime
                            Minister's office General <persName corresp="#p_SSG2"
                            >Sawaeng</persName>. I was accompanied by political and economic
                            counselors.</p>
                        <p>2. In my presentation, I laid particular stress on: a) joint interest of
                            our two governments in Indonesia's economic and financial stability.
                            This importantly furthered by <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>
                            efforts, in context of which U.S. <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> and other assistance provided. b) Opportunity for
                            additional commercial sales which may be presented if <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> decides to forgo 50,000 tons of <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> rice in favor of other <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> commodities; and c) Evidence that
                            our activity has not been disruptive of commercial opportunities
                            provided by fact that 400,000 tons of rice commercially imported by
                            Indonesia in their <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969–70 (almost
                            double the 1965–66 total).</p>
                        <p>3. Thai side argued extensively with all three of these points, with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> carrying the
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> did not argue against aid to
                            Indonesia, but made one point in this respect which he held to politely
                            but persistently—the U.S. should aid Indonesia, but with commodities
                            other than rice or with cash. He said that the amount of money involved
                            in 400,000 tons rice sale meant little to the U.S., but was
                            fundamentally important to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, nominally acting as
                            interpreter but in fact presenting most of the argumentation himself,
                            said “the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> has nothing to do with
                            U.S. Simply because it is a member of <gloss target="#t_IGGI1"
                                >IGGI</gloss>, the United States cannot arrogate to itself the right
                            to take actions seriously detrimental to this country.” He said Thailand
                            is trying hard to stand on its own feet, as Marshall <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> in a recent speech was quoted as
                            saying they should do. Then he added their ability to do so is seriously
                            affected when the United States unfairly disrupts its markets for its
                            principal export, rice.</p>
                        <p>6. I said that the U.S. had not disrupted Thailand's market, but that our
                            actions had greatly helped Indonesia, a country badly in need.</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>Like Thailand, Indonesia was a very important country in Southeast Asia,
                            its security, stability and financial health was very important to the
                            area, including to Thailand, as well as to the U.S. Therefore we were
                            working with others to try to restore Indonesia's economic health, at
                            the same time minimizing the ill effects on the export markets of
                            others. I said the fact that Indonesia's commercial imports were up
                            showed both that the program was in fact contributing to the health of
                            the Indonesian economy and that our program had not interfered with
                            commercial markets. (<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> picked
                            this point up somewhat later.)</p>
                        <p>7. A second point stressed by <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> was that
                            if we had to use rice as a commodity in aid program for Indonesia, we
                            should do as Japan did, i.e., buy some of the rice in Thailand to give
                            to Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> added that
                            Japan had much larger rice stocks than the U.S., yet found it possible
                            to take account of the interest of countries such as Thailand and to
                            forestall the ill effects of its “politically motivated” sales.</p>
                        <p>8. I said I was happy that the Japanese had been able to take this
                            action. I said that in making comparisons with this action and that of
                            the U.S., however, we must remember that Thailand's heavy trade
                            imbalance with Japan, which was not offset in any other way, contributed
                            importantly to Thailand's balance of payments problems. By contrast, the
                            total effect of U.S. activities and direct assistance made an important
                            positive contribution to Thailand's overall balance of payments. Thus I
                            could understand why the Japanese would be especially concerned to
                            compensate at least in some small measure for the overall effect of
                            their role.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then said that if we are
                            going to compare Japan and the U.S., we must remember that Thailand is
                            not extending the same cooperation to Japan and opening the same
                            facilities to Japan that it is to the U.S. He said the Thai contribution
                            to the security of this area and to U.S. interests in particular was
                            persistently overlooked by some in Washington. I said I did not in the
                            least minimize the Thai contribution, but that if we were going to look
                            at the matter in the perspective he had suggested we should also round
                            out the picture and recall the enormous expenditures which the U.S. had
                            made and the enormous role it had played in other respects in Southeast
                            Asia to contribute to the security of the countries of the area.</p>
                        <p>10. On the question of the commercial opportunity being open to Thailand,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> was thoroughly scornful
                            of the 600,000 ton figure originally requested by the Indonesians (“Only
                            a bargaining figure”; “They may just as well have asked for a million
                            tons”). He was equally scornful of the possibility of a further 50,000
                            ton increase from the 400,000 ton planning figure. He said that 50,000
                            tons of rice was “an almost ridiculous amount,” and said that if we were
                            to say we were cutting that 350,000 tons had already been shipped or was
                            in the late <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0271"/>stages of
                            preparation for shipping and therefore the 50,000 tons were all that
                            could be cut from the program. He said (referring to the Vietnamese case
                            of last year) that “ships can be diverted”. He asked “What makes you
                            think they will buy the 50,000 ton balance from us anyway?” I replied
                            that they have been pressing us for more rice, and that we will be
                            supplying other kinds of needs if they decide to forgo the rice which
                            should free the necessary foreign exchange. Thus the possibility seemed
                            good.</p>
                        <p>11. Picking up my point about the 400,000 tons of commercial sales in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69–70, he denied that Indonesia
                            had purchased that much, saying he did not question that I had been told
                            that, but that I had been “misled” by Washington. He said in any case it
                            was “specious reasoning” to say that commercial imports of rice had gone
                            up as the result of our <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> sales.
                            I responded firmly that I had not argued that, but had said that the
                            total effect of our activities, including the <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> sales, had obviously not been disruptive when
                            commercial purchases by Indonesia were double the 1965–66 level. I said
                            we thus saw no evidence that our activities had been disruptive. He said
                            if we would stop our sales we would see immediately how disruptive they
                            had been because Thai export sales would immediately rise. I responded
                            by raising again the question of why Thailand had not obtained more of
                            the rising commercial purchases Indonesia was making. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then challenged me saying did I
                            mean to say that <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> has not
                            disrupted normal commercial sales: what about sales which Thailand in
                            the past has been on the point of making which were cancelled at the
                            last minute because of this program. I said I was addressing the present
                            case of Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> again spoke of
                            “intrusion into a perfectly normal market”. I asked why Germany and
                            others couldn't just as well use such an argument to prove that we were
                            “interfering” with their market in Thailand for equipment, weapons, etc.
                            He simply said that was up to the Germans to raise with us. He said it
                            was up to us to prove we were not causing disruption, not the other way
                            around. He said everyone in Thailand, including the people on the
                            streets, knew that disruption was being caused. I said these people were
                            of course guided by what they were being told by the newspapers and
                            others. I said I knew there was a problem, but the question was why. In
                            the face of the large Indonesian commercial imports in the past year, I
                            was still uncertain why Thailand did not get more of that market.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> again took the position
                            that our figures were simply wrong. </p>
                        <p>13. I said our actions have shown that we do mean to work closely with
                            the Thais to avoid damaging their interests. I said the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has many commitments, including to
                            Indonesia, but we attempted to discharge them without disrupting the
                            markets of others. I recalled again the two reductions already made in
                            the figure for <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> rice for
                            Indonesia, and that we were now proposing another.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0272"/>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> denied that we had taken
                            their interests into account. He said we had not really consulted them,
                            but simply presented them with faits accomplis. He said Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_HS5">Sunthorn</persName> has been treated with
                            “arrogance” in his talks on this subject in Washington. I said I was
                            very surprised to hear him say that, pointing out I had seen no
                            reflection of it in my talks in Washington.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> then said the U.S. does
                            not raise rice for consumption but only to dump on the markets of the
                            world, and asked why we don't do something about production. I pointed
                            out that we had increased rice production to meet a grave world shortage
                            starting in 1965, and that we had thereby saved many people from
                            starvation. We recognized that the supply situation had changed and we
                            had cut back acreage in the past two years, but such an adjustment takes
                            time. He said I was “evading” the U.S. domestic political element. I
                            said of course that element was there, but it was there largely because
                            of the investments American farmers had made to gear up production where
                            it was needed. He said the American economy could adjust more quickly
                            than it was doing.</p>
                        <p>16. At the end I agreed to report the views I had heard to Washington and
                            again urged them to be prepared to follow up on the commercial
                            opportunity that might open. This earned a scornful “thanks” from
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>.</p>
                        <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> While <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName> carried the ball and did most of the talking,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> obviously agreed with
                            him on at least a couple of basic points, i.e., that Thailand is being
                            hurt, and that they got previous little from us in response to his
                            appeal through <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>18. It is worth noting in particular that to reinforce one point about
                                <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> rice sales <persName

                        <p>19. We are withholding any press release or comment until we see how

                        <p>1492. Subject: <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> Rice.</p>
                        <p>1. In informal, wide ranging session with Deputy Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> and two of his close aides and
                            advisors (General <persName corresp="#p_SM5">Surakit Mayalarp</persName>
                            and Dr. Malai Huvanandana), subject of <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> rice assistance to Indonesia came in for extended
                            discussion. I ran through all of our principal arguments and found that
                            he had been well briefed on them in advance by staff members to whom we
                            had earlier provided background material.</p>
                        <p>2. All of our efforts, however, went for little because of the fact that
                            he has also been informed that, when Thailand was negotiating for a
                            commercial sale with Indonesia, the Indonesians, who at first showed
                            considerable interest, later broke off the negotiations and told the
                            Thais they had learned that the U.S. would be supplying Indonesia's rice
                            needs through a <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> deal. In light
                            of this, he said it was of no use to try to “prove” that our program did
                            not interfere with Thai exports to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>3. He went on to make it quite clear that he regards this issue as
                            potentially damaging in the extreme to the long standing friendship
                            between the Thai and American peoples—to him it is not just a
                            government-to-government matter. He said that virtually every Thai
                            person knows about this issue and believes that it strikes at the very
                            heart of Thailand's economy, its rice production and trade. He said this
                            was an issue which could easily put placard-bearing students on the
                            march and which could get out of hand to the point where Americans could
                            not appear on the streets of Bangkok “without getting their heads
                            broken.” All this was said without any personal rancor on his part and
                            in fact with explicit recognition of the political and economic problems
                            we face at home and in full knowledge of the steps we have taken to try
                            to ease the situation from Thailand's point of view.</p>
                        <p>4. I think we must take this as a very serious indication from our
                            friends in the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>, in this case a most
                            important one, that while they are prepared to accept the fact that
                            nothing can be done about our rice shipments to Indonesia during the
                            present Indonesian <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>, they do not <pb

                            face a similar outcome next year without it spilling over to the serious
                            detriment of our general relations with Thailand. (I am not sure myself
                            that we will not feel those consequences a good deal sooner.)</p>
                        <p>5. With this in mind, I would appreciate the earliest possible indication

                        <p>Summary. In preliminary consultations concerning <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> aid to Indonesia during coming
                            year, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> stressed gravity of
                            Thailand's rice problem at present, above all depressed price, and
                            concern that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Japanese activity
                            would leave little room for commercial sales to Indonesia. Our
                            willingness to begin consultations this early and our commitments re
                            timing of agreements are major new positive factors, and were
                            acknowledged as such by <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>.
                            End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. I told <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> at meeting on
                            February 23 that Department had authorized me to open preliminary
                            consultations with him concerning <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> portion of our aid to Indonesia for coming year. He
                            was evidently appreciative of our willingness to begin process this
                            early in the game. He said the rice problem, particularly severely
                            depressed price, was a matter of deep concern to the <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>. This concern was shared by the King,
                            he said, who was taking the closest interest in the problem. In all
                            fairness, he said, they had to accept that there were a great many <pb
                                n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0276"/>factors other than <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> which contributed to the problem.
                            However, the latter did aggravate the problem at a time when it was
                            already extremely serious. He said the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                                >RTG</gloss> might well have to adopt a highly expensive price
                            support program for rice this year to avoid widespread and serious
                            hardship and dissatisfaction in rural areas. He said that the timing and
                            magnitude of our <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> sales, while
                            only one factor, could be an extremely important one.</p>
                        <p>2. I then spoke as outlined in ref A as authorized and modified by ref B.
                            I stressed that what I had given him and the fact that I had been
                            authorized to open these consultations at this time was in further
                            response to the Prime Minister's request to the President made through
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> took note of this and instructed
                            his secretary (Birabhongse) to record the facts so that the substance of
                            my presentation would be passed to the Prime Minister's office.</p>
                        <p>3. Commenting on the substance of our presentation, he noted that our
                            planning figure of 350,000 was half of the minimum estimate of
                            Indonesian requirements. Considering that the Japanese would be active
                            in this market with non-commercial sales as well, he expressed concern
                            that there would be precious little left for commercial sellers. He
                            asked whether we knew what Japan was planning to do this year. I agreed
                            to find out what if anything the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            held on that. (<persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> mentioned,
                            incidentally, that <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> had also
                            complained to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> concerning its rice
                            program for Indonesia.)</p>
                        <p>4. In discussion of level of commercial sales in past years, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> acknowledged that there were
                            other competing suppliers, including Italy and Egypt. However, he said
                            Thailand was much less concerned about them, considering their
                            competition as commercial in contrast to that of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and Japan.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It would be helpful to be able to go
                            back to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> as promptly as
                            possible with whatever information we can provide concerning Japanese
                            intentions. This will of course have a bearing on the position <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will take concerning the 350,000 ton
                            figure. In any case, our commitment with respect to timing, which was
                            obviously responsive to one of the primary concerns <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> expressed prior to my
                            presentation, will be of major help.</p>

                        <p>1. Late yesterday afternoon Amb. <persName>Kennedy</persName> was
                            received in audience by Their Majesties the King and Queen; also present
                            were Mrs. <persName>Kennedy</persName>, Mrs. Whittle, Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> and myself. Amb.
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> at the outset explained President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had asked him to convey
                            his greetings to His Majesty, reaffirm his high regard for Thailand and
                            close interest in developments here, his determination to continue
                            working closely with countries in this region to assure their security,
                            and to solicit any message which His Majesty would like to convey to the
                            President through Amb. <persName>Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. The President's letter of invitation to Their Majesties was then
                                presented.<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">The approved text of the
                                letter was transmitted in telegram 38103 to Bangkok, March 5.
                                (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss>/<persName>KENNEDY</persName>)</note> His Majesty was
                            obviously pleased but expressed his doubt about leaving his country this
                            year in view of the many pressing problems and unsettled situation here.
                            Amb. <persName>Kennedy</persName> made it clear that the President hoped
                            that if this year were not possible, next year might be. (I arranged
                            with His Majesty's aide to get the King's more considered reply for
                            transmittal to the President as soon as it is ready.)</p>
                        <p>3. The remainder of the discussion between His Majesty and Amb.
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> was taken up in a lengthy and intense
                            discussion by the King of several critical issues now facing Thailand.
                            First on the list and obviously of profound concern to His Majesty was
                            Thailand's severe internal and external economic problems deriving from
                            the depressed price of rice and the important contribution to this
                            problem made by U.S. <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> sales,
                            above all to Indonesia. His Majesty's review of the problem was along
                            familiar lines but I think we must not underestimate the strength of his
                            feelings on this matter and his conviction that the rice problem will
                            have not only mounting economic consequences but serious political
                            repercussions as well, potentially very damaging to U.S.-Thai relations.
                            Without going into detail His Majesty also alluded to the problem of
                            disposal of rubber surpluses.</p>
                        <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0278"/>
                        <p>4. The other major topic was a review by His Majesty of the growing
                            insurgency problem. Here his principal emphasis was laid in the first
                            place on the need for equipment (above all helicopters) for the border
                            patrol police who should receive support largely according to the same
                            criteria as the military forces since their role is largely a military
                            one. He also made clear his dissatisfaction with inept administration
                            and even oppression by public officials as a contributory factor to the
                            growth of the insurgency.</p>
                        <p>5. At the close of the audience His Majesty expressed appreciation for
                            the President's having sent Amb. <persName>Kennedy</persName> and the
                            opportunity it provided for him to convey his messages in return.</p>
                        <p>6. Amb. <persName>Kennedy</persName> has approved this message.</p>

                            spokesman.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> opened discussion with brief
                            explanation of his Presidential mandate. In his response <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> immediately turned to Thailand's
                            balance of payments problem. Thailand was still a low income country
                            depending for economic viability heavily on a few export commodities.
                            Rice was by far the most important export. Current trends toward
                            self-sufficiency in neighboring countries, which constituted Thailand's
                            markets, were seriously reducing export opportunities and depressing
                            price. This problem was intensified by <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> sales. Besides rice, the important rubber market was
                            weak, and the surplus disposal issue is a depressing effect. Tin,
                            although of somewhat less importance to Thailand, was another export
                            commodity whose price was declining. Ambassador
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> briefly commented on the importance of
                            agricultural diversification in coping with excessive dependence on one
                            or a few export commodities, but <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName>, speaking through <persName corresp="#p_PS5"
                                >Pote</persName>, returned to his theme. Diversification required
                            both time and markets. For Thailand rice was now and would inevitably
                            remain for some time the principal export commodity. For the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, rice was a marginal product. Thailand
                            was able and prepared to compete even in the present depressed market on
                            normal commercial terms, but was unable to compete against concessional
                            terms offered to its traditional customers. Thailand's problem was
                            intensified by the increasing financial burden of essential security
                            measures and need to expand development activities just to keep even
                            with population increase. Security was a precondition for economic
                            development, and economic development without security would be
                            meaningless.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> said the United States was
                            anxious to be helpful in assisting Thailand in working its way out of
                            its present predicament. Among the major tasks with which we might be
                            able to be helpful were the development of expertise and education, and
                            particularly with diversification and market development. <gloss

                            <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0280"/>Sanga immediately returned to
                            the theme of rice, saying that the biggest single problem in finding a
                            market for the rice available for export was Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> expressed understanding of the
                            importance of this problem, and asked whether tourism was expanding.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> replied that the number
                            of tourists was increasing, but money was getting scarce and the hotels
                            were suffering. Returning to rice, he said that Thailand had considered
                            subsidizing the Thai farmer, but there was really no way to do this
                            which the country could afford. Sanga added that current prices were far
                            below last year's. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                                >Unger</persName> said that, recognizing Thailand's concern about
                            this matter, we wanted to be extremely careful regarding next year's
                                <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> program. We would consider
                            what the ministers had told us, continue our consultations, which had
                            already begun, both here and in Washington and avoid, in particular,
                            timing of sales which would fall within Thailand's principal marketing
                            period.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>, for the first time raising
                            a subject other than rice, said tourism was very important to Thailand.
                            Thailand was providing all possible incentives for its expansion. He
                            was, therefore, concerned about reports that PanAm was taking its 747's
                            to Singapore and hoped that they would not bypass Bangkok. He and
                            Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> then briefly discussed character
                            of tourist industry here.</p>
                        <p>7. Returning to rice <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> hoped that the United States
                            might be able to lend money to Indonesia on favorable terms to buy rice
                            from Thailand. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                            explained that American rice to Indonesia was in effect not supplied on
                            a loan basis but as outright aid. In a sense it did double duty: the
                            rice itself met an urgent immediate requirement in foreign exchange
                            field, and the rupiahs paid for it were channeled into development.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said he understood well
                            that the American program was very helpful to Indonesia, and Thailand
                            ‘could not make too much noise about it.’ Indonesia needed rice and had
                            no foreign exchange to buy it. But even if the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> lent money to Indonesia for only two years to purchase
                            this rice from Thailand, this would help Thailand get over the worst of
                            its readjustment to the new situation. The Minister of Finance commented
                            that for the same reason Thailand warmly welcomed other <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance to Indonesia, including
                            American investment in Indonesia. The inflow of American resources in
                            turn enabled Indonesia to purchase other requirements from Thailand.
                            Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> said part of the problem was
                            that Indonesia's problems were long-term. It took the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and other international lenders to
                            work out an approach that seemed appropriate to the Indonesian
                            situation, and this type of solution was not addressed to Thailand's
                            short-term problem. He was most anxious to understand Thailand's problem
                            and to have this opportunity to discuss it with Thai leaders.</p>

                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>, speaking through
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>, said Thailand was happy
                            to know that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> helped Indonesia
                            which has turned toward the free world. This assistance helped in
                            strengthening the whole region. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                                >Thanom</persName> wanted this help to continue, and was only
                            concerned that it should not create problems for Thailand's own
                            endeavors to help itself.</p>
                        <p>9. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> said he was here to learn and
                            appreciated the friendship extended to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            over many years. It was the President's personal determination to build
                            strength throughout the region and to work together with Thailand. It
                            was his conviction that a good potential for a stronger economy existed
                            throughout the whole area. He was also well aware of the fact that
                            sometimes we ourselves were slowing down deliberately and tightening our
                            budget in a manner that made itself felt in many contexts, in particular
                            in our aid programs and in American tourism.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> raised the question of
                            special funds. The Asian Development Bank had substantial resources by
                            now but its terms were such that Thailand did not appear able to receive
                            much help from it. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> said that the
                            administration had been unable to obtain Congressional approval for
                            special funds for the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>. It had been
                            his own endeavor to have the United States make a contribution to <gloss
                                target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>'s special funds equal to that which the
                            Japanese were making. This position which envisaged a <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> contribution of approximately $100
                            million had the firm support of the executive, and had been included in
                            a bill providing for appropriations for other international lending
                            institutions. Even though special funds for the <gloss target="#t_ADB1"
                                >ADB</gloss> had been deleted by the Congress, the request will be
                            resubmitted. The <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, which had been
                            slow in getting started, was nevertheless now in a better position to
                            contribute to the development of the region.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> asked whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could help Indonesia with commodities
                            other than rice. Was the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> discouraging
                            farmers from growing rice? Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> said
                            technological progress such as use of fertilizers sometimes permitted
                            increases in yields even though acreage was restricted. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> referred to the recent
                            discussion of our Indonesian aid program in Bangkok and Washington and
                            pointed out that we had in fact offered to substitute other commodities
                            this year for some rice scheduled for Indonesia. Indonesia needed a
                            great deal of rice at certain times, and he repeated the hope that by
                            beginning consultations on this complex problem early our efforts to
                            reduce or eliminate an unfavorable impact on Thailand would be as
                            effective as possible. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>
                            repeated that the Prime Minister wanted to stress the key importance of
                            rice to Thailand. Indonesia constitutes a traditional market for about
                            300,000 tons of rice. With a disposable surplus of about 1 million tons,
                            and with few other large markets (such <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233"
                                facs="0282"/>as Hong Kong), sales to Indonesia were critical. He
                            wished to repeat the suggestion that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> assist Indonesia by lending to it, perhaps through
                            banking channels, an amount corresponding to the present level of
                            American assistance. This would help solve Thailand's problem and
                            satisfy everyone. Thailand itself would need <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> assistance and was looking forward to further talks
                            about this matter.</p>
                        <p>12. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> expressed his deep
                            appreciation for the opportunity to meet with his hosts and to explore
                            these important problems with them.</p>

                            be composed of regulars and would count against the total of regulars
                            projected for <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s. No extra money would
                            be required for this program, since these troops would proceed into
                                <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> programs. The regulars are part
                            of the 1,174-man cadre already planned for the program. [<hi

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, why not go

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: There is a second item that was a late
                            starter for this meeting. This is medevac for Ban Na. We were talking
                            this over before the meeting and agreed that there would be great
                            difficulty in stationing gunships in Laos. The Joint Staff is going to
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to see if it would not
                            be possible to put the gunships in Udorn, realizing that they might have
                            to refuel in Laos. There are two questions: whether we have the
                            necessary assets and whether they should be stationed in Udorn.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Weren't Air America
                            pilots to be used for this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>: We were talking about

                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KRT2">Knowles</persName>: We were talking
                            about gunships other than Cobras. I will ring out <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to see what is available.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_CLGRE1">Cushman</persName>: Cobras are not
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KRT2">Knowles</persName>: We will check this
                            out, but it is unlikely that we can get any Cobras.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me see if I
                            understand what has been agreed. We are going to station gunships in
                            Udorn.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KRT2">Knowles</persName>: We are going out to
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to see, first, if we can
                            station gunships (probably of the UHB type) at Udorn and, second,
                            whether they can be provided with range-extension kits or whether we can
                            put some bladders in Laos for refueling. The B-type gunships have
                            greater utility, since they can also do some medevac.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can find out if
                            it is feasible. If it proves to be feasible why not go ahead and do
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>: We decided that we
                            should not base the gunships in Laos. We can approve a program that
                            bases them in Thailand but provides for refueling in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't see what
                            more we can learn once we determine whether this is technically
                            feasible. Is everyone agreed that we should go ahead if this proposal is
                            feasible?</p>
                        <p>All agreed. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not

                                >Praphat</persName> on April 1 expressed grave concern about outcome

                            generally worried about what he sees as evidence of uncertainty in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> about concrete support to

                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Evening Thursday, April 1 I had a long, highly informal session with
                            Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>
                            over drinks. He had only <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> Chief of
                            Staff Surakij and his civilian adviser Malai with him. I was accompanied
                            by political counselor.</p>
                        <p>3. It soon became clear that the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> was
                            in generally gloomy mood about situation in this area. After brief and
                            very general discussion of problems that had arisen during two decades
                            of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military assistance to Thailand,
                            and somewhat more specific reference to problems and ambiguities in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for Thai operations and
                            contingency plans in recent months, General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                                >Praphat</persName> said he was deeply worried about the
                            uncertainties that had arisen concerning <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> support for the countries of Southeast Asia in the
                            future. He said the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> seemed to be
                            wavering in its commitment to this area because of domestic politics—he
                            referred to pledges to strengthen countries in the region but didn't see
                            evidence of this in Thailand. He said he and the other <gloss
                                target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> leaders were strongly committed to
                            continue cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, but
                            that if the uncertainties about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            intentions were allowed to deepen no one could tell when the Thai
                            people, or Asian people generally, would feel obliged to change their
                            attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. He then introduced the subject of Lam Son 719, and it was quickly
                            apparent that this had contributed greatly to his disturbed frame of
                            mind. Reiterating several times that he was giving us an “Asian view” as
                            a close friend, he said he was extremely worried about what he
                            characterized as the premature withdrawal from the route 9 area of Laos.
                            He said he had heard from South Vietnamese sources that their retreat
                            was made necessary by poor US support—the source claimed some units were
                            not even kept supplied with basics such as ammunition. He expressed the
                            view that if we were not prepared to stay in key parts of the trail area
                            until the end of the dry season, it would have been much better not to
                            go in at all. He compared the action to striking a bee hive with a
                            stick, which makes the bees go out and sting everyone, but which does
                            not prevent their return, leaving everything as before. In fact he said
                            the enemy would be even better prepared next year to meet attempts to
                            block their efforts, attempts which would have even less US support than
                            the present ones had. He said it appeared that political considerations
                            had prevailed over military in this operation. He expressed concern that
                            the intent may have <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0286"/>been merely
                            to keep the situation in the South quiet so as to permit continued
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> withdrawals that would leave the
                            countries of the area to cope with a worsened situation afterwards.</p>
                        <p>5. I said I was quite certain he was misinterpreting the purpose of the
                            operation and not giving enough credit to its achievement. I noted that
                            from the beginning it had been said publicly and privately that the
                            intent was to destroy and to disrupt the flow of supplies and
                            ammunition, not to hold territory. The strength of the enemy reaction
                            seemed to have been a factor in determining the length of the operation,
                            but indications were the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> generally
                            fought well. As for our support, I said that weather was always a
                            problem in connection with air operations, especially helicopter
                            operations. I said the President had to be realistic about what he could
                            do on a continuing basis since this could be done only with the support
                            of the American people, and therefore could not put <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ground forces in Laos in support of the
                            Vietnamese troops. But I said our air and logistic support had been
                            massive and unstinting. With respect to the effect of the operation, in
                            addition to the casualties inflicted and the impact on supplies, it
                            seemed almost certain now that the operation had given the Cambodians
                            another year in which to train and equip their forces. By next dry
                            season they should be a much more significant factor in the picture.
                            Likewise other friendly countries in the area would be stronger by then
                            so that the outlook was by no means bleak in spite of the fact that
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop withdrawals from Vietnam
                            would be continuing.</p>
                        <p>6. While he took note of and understood my arguments, it was perfectly
                            clear that he still believed the friendly forces should have gone in to
                            stay until the end of the dry season, or not have gone in at all. With
                            respect to strengthening the countries of the area, he did not question
                            this with respect to South Vietnam and Cambodia, but he asked how much
                            stronger will Thailand really be by the end of next year. He said old
                            plans we had begun on had not been completed, and new plans have been
                            discussed but implementation has not begun. He reminded me gently that
                            he has been waiting for months to hear from me concerning plans and
                            preparations which we asked them to begin making for Cambodian
                            contingencies. Meanwhile he said he gets constant requests for his armed
                            forces to loan equipment to others, and to provide training to others
                            who “arrive naked” looking to Thailand to supply them from the ground
                            up. While we have promised to replace what Thailand is giving he has

                        <p>During the course of a wide-ranging luncheon conversation on Thailand's
                            present rice marketing difficulties Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1"
                                >Barger</persName> reviewed actions the United States has taken or

                                >PL–480</gloss> food assistance to Indonesia. He noted first that
                            this past year the total amount of U.S. <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> rice provided to Indonesia totaled 350,000 tons as
                            compared to their original request for 600,000 tons. He said that part
                            of this reduction—50,000 tons—had been in direct response to an appeal
                            made by the Prime Minister to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>Moreover, we began early consultations with the Thai on next year's
                            program. Such consultations have been virtually continuous on this
                            subject between the State Department and the Thai Embassy in Washington
                            and Thai and American officials in Bangkok since the problem was
                            originally raised several months ago. Out of these consultations had
                            come our decision to stay out of the Indonesian market during the peak
                            period of Thai rice sales. This had come at the specific request of the
                            Thai Government and we had duly informed the Foreign Ministry of our
                            willingness to cooperate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1"
                                >Barger</persName> also said that the U.S. would try to avoid
                            piecemeal sales and attempt to cover all <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                                >PL–480</gloss> rice sales to Indonesia for the year under one
                            agreement. Furthermore, the U.S. was willing to discuss at the <gloss
                                target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> a “Usual Marketing Requirements”
                            provision in agreements with the Indonesians. This would guarantee that
                            Indonesia would then procure a fixed proportion of her rice import needs
                            on the commercial market.</p>
                        <p>At various points in the conversation Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1"
                                >Barger</persName> pointed out that the real problem facing Thailand
                            stemmed from the “Green Revolution” and the desire of almost all
                            countries to be self-sufficient in rice. The essential task is to come
                            to grips with this phenomenon but the issue of U.S. <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> rice sales has tended to divert
                            Thai attention from it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SNDUSS1">Suthi</persName> said that the U.S.
                            decision to stay out of the Indonesian market during the period
                            immediately following the Thai harvest, which is the time when the bulk
                            of Thailand's commercial sales abroad are made, was really meaningless
                            since the Indonesians would attempt to avoid buying from Thailand during
                            that period. First, he said, the Indonesian warehouses were full then,
                            making it impossible to import more rice at that time. Moreover, they
                            wanted to know the size of their own harvest before making any decisions
                            on import requirements. They would then seek to cover as much of their
                            deficit as possible through aid. Even if they were finally forced to
                            make some commercial purchases the effect of their waiting would have
                            been to force down the price of Thai rice. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> said that the Thai Government's
                            view as expressed to us through the Foreign Ministry was that it <hi
                                rend="italic">was</hi> important for us to stay out of the
                            Indonesian market during Thailand's peak trading period.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d114fn2">Telegram 5615 from Djakarta, June 30, reported the

                                success. It added that the “Indonesians were not disposed to buy
                                rice from Thais against whom they harbor resentment for what they
                                consider past price gouging. This resentment could be exacerbated if
                                Thais again agitate about U.S. supply of <gloss target="#t_PL4801"

                        <p>At another point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VN1">Vicharn</persName> said
                            the new principle of the World Food Organization was that food aid
                            should not only benefit the recipient country but should also help the
                            other developing countries that could supply that country's needs. He
                            said that it was in accordance with this principle that the Japanese had
                            agreed last year to purchase part of the rice it had undertaken to
                            supply to Indonesia from Thailand. He said that Thailand would be very
                            pleased if the U.S. could also adhere to this principle in supplying
                            Indonesia with rice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> pointed out that there
                            was a significant difference between the U.S. and Japan in this
                            instance. The U.S. is already supplying Thailand with considerable aid
                            in other forms. Moreover, Thailand does not have a payments deficit with
                            the U.S. Finally, since the U.S. has balance of payments problems of its
                            own and a rice surplus the U.S. Congress is hardly likely to provide
                            money for rice purchases in Thailand. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VN1"
                                >Vicharn</persName> said that the amount would not have to be large
                            whereupon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> said that if
                            Thailand was only interested in a cosmetic effect it could be done with
                            a pencil; all that would be necessary would be to make a slight
                            adjustment in the accounting procedures we are now using for the aid we
                            are already providing to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SNDUSS1">Suthi</persName>'s comment should not be
                            regarded as overly significant. In the first instance it probably
                            reflects the usual lack of Thai interministerial coordination. Beyond
                            that it is indicative of the Thai frustration over their lack of success
                            in capturing a significant proportion of the Indonesian commercial
                            market during the last few years. <persName corresp="#p_SNDUSS1"
                                >Suthi</persName> was right to the extent that U.S. activity in the
                            Indonesian market whenever it may occur is not likely to affect
                            Thailand's lack of competitiveness. <persName corresp="#p_VN1"
                                >Vicharn</persName>'s proposal was certainly not new. He realizes,
                            however, that political considerations effectively eliminate such action
                            from the realm of possibility. His advancement of it was more in the way
                            of a pro forma plea rather than as a serious proposal.</p>

                    <p>Dear Marshall:</p>
                    <p>Our projection of future developments in Thailand involves us at the very
                        outset in consideration of developments in United States policy. The major
                        developments in Thai foreign and defense policy which are now taking place
                        are a direct reaction to changes and anticipated changes in U.S. policy
                        toward Southeast Asia. These changes have been most apparent in the context
                        of the Indochina war, particularly in our reaction to events in Laos and
                        Cambodia. In addition, over the past year the insurgency has grown in terms
                        of the strength of the insurgents, the areas affected and in the impact on
                        national life. Furthermore, the Thai have become alarmed over adverse trends
                        in their economic situation. Their economic difficulties have given stimulus
                        to a new nationalist and restrictionist outlook, and have placed additional
                        strains on the fledgling parliamentary system. Thailand faces a difficult
                        period of adjustment over the next few years, and Thai leaders face
                        difficult decisions if they are to meet urgent defense requirements without
                        sacrificing development needs. While we are not, on balance, pessimistic in
                        our general projection, we recognize that our ability to influence Thai
                        decisions on these important issues is declining with the shift in U.S.—and
                        Thai— policy. In reading what follows it should be borne in mind that there
                        are differing trends and currents in the Thai leadership's thinking and the
                        issues identified are not necessarily seen in the same light by all.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Thai-U.S. Relations</p>
                    <p>Thailand is taking the first reluctant and tentative steps toward a partial
                        disengagement from the close relationship with the U.S. which she has
                        maintained over the past two decades. This process is painful to the Thai,
                        but will doubtless continue—at a rate, I believe, closely related to the
                        reduction of the American presence in Southeast Asia and of the credibility
                        of the American commitment to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>Thai leaders have accepted the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine as a reasonable and responsible statement of U.S. policy, but they
                        are increasingly doubtful that the President will be able to carry out his
                        policies in the face of political and especially Congressional resistance.
                        As Deputy Prime Minister <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0291"/> (and heir
                        apparent) <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> remarked when I
                        presented him a copy of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName>' Foreign Policy Report 1969–70, Thai leaders find no
                        fault whatever with statements of U.S. Policy—it is the implementation which
                        sometimes troubles them.</p>
                    <p>Changes in U.S. policy, as they affect Thailand, have been revealed to the
                        Thai most clearly in the context of the Indochina war, particularly in Laos
                        and Cambodia, where the Thai see the U.S. ability to prosecute the war
                        increasingly hedged in by Congressional restrictions. These restrictions
                        alter the security situation for Thailand in basic ways, and have led the
                        Thai to question the validity of the American commitment to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>In forward defense of their homeland, the Thai have been willing to commit
                        forces in Vietnam and, covertly, in Laos. However, their involvement was
                        undertaken with full U.S. backing and assistance, and with the expectation
                        of U.S. support in the event the conflict should spread to threaten Thailand
                        directly. This concept—of American support to enable a Southeast Asian
                        country to go to the defense of a neighbor—had to be discarded when, after
                        the conflict spread to Cambodia, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was
                        legally constrained from supporting Thai military operations in Cambodia. As
                        a result, the Thai increasingly question the possibility of our past
                        partnership's continuing. Although they still attach great value to the
                        alliance, I think that in the future they will view with increasing care and
                        skepticism any new American proposals for cooperative actions which would
                        expose them to a potentially dangerous situation, unless they receive
                        concrete evidence that adequate American support will be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>On military matters, U.S.-Thai relations continue to reflect a high degree of
                        cooperation, and I expect that this will generally continue to be the case
                        with activities which the Thai consider to be directly related to their
                        security. They recognize that U.S. military and economic assistance are
                        needed to meet Thailand's development and security problems. They also
                        recognize the importance to Thailand of U.S. efforts to bring the Indonesia
                        war to an acceptable conclusion, and in this context the still considerable
                        U.S. military presence continues to be only a relatively minor source of
                        friction. It will in the future be increasingly difficult, however, to
                        secure Thai cooperation in nonmilitary areas, and even in some U.S. military
                        activities in which the Thai do not consider that there is a mutual benefit.
                        We are already feeling the effects of an increased Thai nationalism in our
                        dealings with civilian branches of the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>,
                        and we expect that these frictions will increase. This could lead to acute
                        issues between us and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> over the
                        status of U.S. military personnel still stationed here.</p>
                    <p>Another rapidly emerging problem is that of drugs. We can expect strains in
                        our relations as accusations are levelled at Thailand from the <pb n="243"
                            xml:id="pg_243" facs="0292"/>U.S. because of frustrations there over
                        this tragic U.S. domestic problem and as we work with the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> to try to control the traffic in drugs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">New Foreign Policy Directions</p>
                    <p>Disillusionment with the 20-year old relationship with the United States has
                        led the Thai to consider new foreign policy directions—they are moving
                        cautiously toward expanded trade and other relations with the Soviet Union
                        and other Eastern European countries, they have made tentative overtures to
                        initiate some kind of dialogue with Peking, and they have attempted
                        exploratory talks seeking some way of reducing the hostility of North
                        Vietnam. The Thai are, however, too realistic to abandon the protection
                        which the remaining U.S. presence in Southeast Asia affords them, as the
                        price of a risky accommodation with Peking.</p>
                    <p>We expect that the Thai will continue their role of active leadership in
                        moves toward regionalism, especially in economic and social matters. I
                        believe they will also emphasize the political aspects of regionalism, in an
                        attempt to gain for Southeast Asia a measure of influence in international
                        councils which can be attained only by joint action. On security issues, the
                        essential and continuing Thai view is that, without the support of a major
                        power, the military effectiveness of the nations of Southeast Asia would not
                        be enhanced significantly through a regional alliance. They recognize that
                        Japan is unlikely, in the foreseeable future, to play a major security role,
                        although they view the expanding Japanese influence and participation in
                        Southeast Asian affairs as largely inevitable and, on balance, in Thai
                        interests.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Prospects</p>
                    <p>Increasing pressures on the Thai economy will also be a key factor
                        influencing Thai foreign policy, U.S.-Thai relations, Thai internal
                        politics, and Thailand's defense capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Thailand's very substantial rate of economic growth during the decade of the
                        1960's obscured from the Thai Government the pressing need to make changes
                        in law and policy, and in its economic development strategy, if it were to
                        sustain the rate of growth. Since 1965, however, earnings from some major
                        commodity exports—principally rice, tin and rubber—have stagnated because of
                        falling external demand and/or falling prices. By mid-1969 the softening
                        markets for Thai exports, lower U.S. military expenditures, and reduced net
                        inflows on capital account, together with a continuation of the heavy demand
                        for imports which built up during the booming 60's, combined to produce a
                        sizeable balance of payments deficit and a consequent drawdown in Thai
                        foreign exchange reserves. We anticipate continuing depressed markets for
                        traditional Thai exports, and continuing reductions in U.S. military
                        expenditures; thus we foresee no relief from the balance of payments
                        disequilibrium for some time.</p>
                    <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0293"/>
                    <p>The Thai economy continues to be basically sound, but there is a growing
                        urgency for government action to maximize inflow of foreign investment
                        capital needed to spur industrial development, to maximize foreign exchange
                        earnings, and to spur and diversify agricultural production. The immediate
                        challenge is to accomplish this sufficiently within the next one or two
                        years to reverse the downward trend in foreign exchange reserves, or at
                        least stabilize them at a level above a danger point. The longer range
                        challenge, of course, is to sustain growth so that Thai economic
                        capabilities can support Thai defense needs and the educational, social and
                        other developmental programs required, given the very high rate of
                        population growth.</p>
                    <p>While the need for corrective action by the Thai Government is becoming
                        increasingly urgent, we find that our ability to influence their decision is
                        declining. This results from a number of factors including Thai attitudes
                        toward the United States discussed above, increasing nationalism, and a
                        scaling down and refocusing of our aid programs and other U.S. inputs into
                        the economy.</p>
                    <p>Rice, rubber and tin, major Thai exports which are now suffering from
                        depressed international markets, are all commodities on which U.S.
                        Government actions—<gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> sales and
                        stockpile disposals— threaten (at least in Thai minds) to reduce Thai export
                        earnings. Needless to say, it is extremely important for us to bear in mind
                        not only the real economic effects our actions may have on Thailand, but
                        also the effects such actions may have on overall Thai cooperation with
                        us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Evolution</p>
                    <p>While the past two years have brought experience and increased
                        self-confidence in their ability to work within a parliamentary government,
                        the Thai have hardly begun to develop the political parties and other
                        institutions needed to make a workable democratic political system. The
                        parliamentary process frequently has been a source of irritation to the
                        military men who still dominate the Council of Ministers, and few of them
                        show a real understanding of its workings. However, the desire to be counted
                        among the democratic countries of the world, shared by virtually all
                        important groups and leaders in Thailand, continues to encourage leaders to
                        work within the democratic process and to inhibit impulses toward drastic
                        solutions.</p>
                    <p>Over the next two or three years, the economic difficulties Thailand is
                        encountering will place increasing pressures on the parliamentary system.
                        Members of Parliament are growing more vocal in their criticisms of
                        government performance on economic problems, particularly the problems of
                        the rice farmers who constitute over 80 percent of the Thai population. The
                        issue will inevitably become more heated as the 1973 elections approach, and
                        political considerations will weigh <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0294"
                        />heavily in <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> decisions on economic
                        problems. Thus political and economic pressures on the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will combine in a way likely to increase
                        the irritation potential of the Thai parliamentary process, and this may
                        inhibit rational economic decisions by the government.</p>
                    <p>The top leadership of the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will inevitably
                        undergo some changes during the next few years. All of the key men are very
                        near the same age and will soon reach sixty, the mandatory retirement age in
                        both the military and civil service. It is virtually certain that Field
                        Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom Kittikachorn</persName> will not
                        be Prime Minister after the elections in early 1973, and he may step down
                        before that date. Deputy Prime Minister General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat Charusathien</persName> now seems to be the unchallenged heir
                        apparent but he too is getting older. General Kris Sivara is waiting in the
                        wings but age would make his tenure at most a brief one. Beyond that the
                        picture is less clear. While any change of leadership is bound to involve a
                        certain amount of maneuvering, the present leaders appear to have put
                        trusted general and field grade officers into the key military positions,
                        thus greatly reducing the uncertainties as to what group—if not which
                        individual—is likely to succeed them.</p>
                    <p>Future difficulties, arising possibly from a depressed economic situation or
                        an internal or external threat to Thai security, could at some point affect
                        Thailand's internal political stability. However, I believe the likelihood
                        is that the changing of the guard that must come before too many years will
                        be relatively smooth.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Insurgency</p>
                    <p>Communist insurgent capabilities and organization accelerated sharply over
                        the past year. The most significant <gloss target="#t_CPT1">CPT</gloss>
                        gains have been the establishment in both the north and northeast of
                        reasonably secure base areas for supply and training purposes, and the
                        substantial upgrading of insurgent weaponry from external sources. These
                        bases will facilitate more rapid insurgent expansion.</p>
                    <p>In the northeast, Communist cadre have undertaken a systematic expansion of
                        party influence and control by organizing more formal village militia units,
                        providing full-time presence in about 100 villages, and providing a
                        recruiting and training ground for subsequent promotion upwards into local
                        units and thence to hardcore regular “Thai People's Liberation Armed Forces”
                        (TPLAF). Government efforts to counter the insurgency have been weakened by
                        lack of vigorous national policy direction, diversion of the leadership's
                        attention to threats to Thailand's security from Cambodia and Laos,
                        frictions between the major responsible elements of the <gloss

                    <p>—The Thai questioning centered on the relationship of the proposed <gloss
                            target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> program to on-going military and
                        economic assistance programs and revealed considerable Thai misgivings on
                        the proposed program.</p>
                    <p>—The Thai challenged what they considered to be the requirement for “double
                        consultation” (on both the economic and military sides) for the same fund
                        contribution. <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> was subsequently
                        told that <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> has decided to set up
                        separate civilian and military groups to plan implementation of the proposal
                        with us. Discussions will start next week.</p>

                            >Unger</persName> believes that the Thai understand the dimension of our
                        proposal. Their attitude toward the size of the new resources available and
                        toward the complications of the interlocking military and economic programs
                        was reserved but <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> believes that
                        Thai suspicions and concerns, at least in part, are due to the difficulty
                        they are having in grasping the new concept of <hi rend="italic"
                            >indirect</hi> assistance.</p>
                    <p>The Thai view that the new program constitutes a double intrusion into their
                        budget process is also an obvious irritant. However, <persName

                        will adapt to this system and he hopes that this new military assistance
                        tool, Baht resources, will enable the U.S. to get the program under way.</p>

                        Secretary's Bilateral Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. In a private conversation between the Secretary and Thai Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat Khoman</persName>, the latter said
                        that he was satisfied with the outcome of our discussions thus far on the
                            <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL 480</gloss> rice question. <pb n="248"
                            xml:id="pg_248" facs="0297"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> indicated however that he felt
                        it important that in the coming year we avoid handling the matter as we did
                        over the past fall and winter.</p>
                    <p>2. In a much more extended discussion on the China question, the Secretary
                        told <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> that we still have under
                        consideration the choice of continuing our present policy or adopting the
                        principle of universality: no decision has been reached as yet. The
                        Secretary did make clear that whichever way we move, we cannot accept the
                        expulsion from the United Nations of the Republic of China, something which
                        would generate a very strong dissent in the United States and could
                        undermine our support of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>3. After a discussion of the various options available, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> recommended against proceeding at all
                        this coming fall with the “important question” approach. He is persuaded
                        that this will surely be defeated and in the aftermath the Republic of China
                        will be put out of the United Nations. Instead of that formula, he and the
                        Secretary discussed one which would be more positively based on seeking
                        approval for the admission in the United Nations to the People's Republic of
                        China. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> felt such a tactic
                        offered better possibilities of avoiding the expulsion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which Thailand also opposes. In the course
                        of this discussion with <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> the
                        related question of representation in the Security Council was not
                        raised.</p>

                        military presence and capability in East Asia declines in the coming years,
                        Thailand's role in <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0298"/>regional affairs
                        will become increasingly important as an issue in United States policy. The
                            “<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine” enunciates some
                        general principles that are relevant to Thailand but the Doctrine is
                        compatible with a wide range of policy options and needs more precise
                        definition.</p>
                    <p>We have in essence a choice between two general roles that we might want
                        Thailand to play in Southeast Asia. In one, Thailand would serve as an agent
                        of the United States, while also defending its own security interests,
                        through a primarily military posture of defense and deterrence against
                        further Communist expansion in the region. This role would envisage a line
                        drawn somewhere in Indochina which would represent the perimeter of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> balance of power interests and would
                        correspond with our assessment of what we could expect to hold, relying in
                        part on Thai manpower resources and probably also on our use of Thai bases
                        for supportive <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air operations. That line
                        would also represent a Thai forward defense perimeter, though it would lie
                        well beyond the vital zone that the Thai would be willing or capable of
                        attempting to hold without <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> subsidy and
                        support. The line would of course contain within it other political regimes
                        (e.g. non-Communist regimes in South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) which we
                        felt it essential to back indirectly, without U.S. ground combat forces, and
                        which the Thai could be persuaded to support directly, with our aid, in its
                        own security interests. This role for Thailand would be consistent with
                        those portions of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine
                        which emphasize <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> fidelity to our security
                        commitments, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> willingness to support the
                        defense capabilities of friends and allies, and <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> interest in promoting regional cooperation—in this case
                        military cooperation involving Thai assistance to its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>A major argument in favor of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for
                        Thailand in the role sketched above is that, if Thai forces proved
                        effective, it would help to keep the Communist threat away from Thai borders
                        and therefore would reduce the risk of armed attack that could bring into
                        play our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment. While we are
                        pledged to uphold that commitment, we obviously do not want to have it
                        tested because we wish to avoid the choice between further <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> fighting in Southeast Asia and reneging on
                        the commitment.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it is questionable whether this militant role for Thailand
                        is feasible in the current political atmosphere in the United States and in
                        light of the proclivities and capabilities of the Thai themselves.
                        Successful implementation of this concept would be heavily dependent upon
                        the willingness of Congress and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public
                        to back it, both in funding Thai military forces (and associated economic
                        assistance requirements) and in the security reassurances that the Thai
                        would seek if they were asked to continue exposing themselves in this
                        fashion to Communist military power in areas forward of their own <pb
                            n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0299"/>vital security zone. It would also
                        be dependent on Thai confidence that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        promises of support and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitments would
                        remain firm over a relatively long period of time. It could have serious
                        consequences if the Thai should be ineffective in their military role or if
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, because of political and legislative
                        developments at home, should have to have to cut off support for the Thai
                        after starting them down this path.</p>
                    <p>As an alternative to this role for Thailand, we could see that country
                        confining its security attention to Thailand itself, though with due concern
                        for certain adjacent border areas of truly vital interest to Thailand, and
                        seeking to settle its affairs with both North Vietnam and Peking by
                        political rather than military means. In this role, the Thai might use the
                        possibility of their intervention in support of neighboring non-Communist
                        regimes (and the fact of their current presence in Laos) as a bargaining
                        tool in attempting to reach an understanding with North Vietnam. The <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> security commitment and the actuality or
                        possibility of Thai bases being used by the United States could also be
                        helpful for this purpose and to strengthen Thai hands in working for
                        accommodation with Peking. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would
                        confine its assistance to developing Thai strength economically and
                        militarily for defense and internal security. We would terminate as soon as
                        possible our subsidization of Thai mercenaries in Laos and desist from
                        further planning on U.S. support of Thai forces in a regional role.</p>
                    <p>This alternative role for Thailand would, like the first, be compatible with
                        the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, especially with
                        the Doctrine's emphasis upon local initiative and a reduced American
                        “profile” in Southeast Asia. It would, on the other hand, call for us to
                        downplay the security commitment element of our relationship with Thailand
                        and to reduce Thai dependence upon that commitment. It could lead to a
                        “neutral” Thailand, with <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> eventually
                        reduced to a dead letter. This alternative would be consistent with present
                        trends in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public opinion and legislation
                        which do not favor subsidizing Asians to fight Asians in support of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests—or in support of our <gloss
                            target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> friends' interests as we see them. This
                        alternative would also be compatible with traditional Thai methods of
                        dealing with the outside world and with a strong current of opinion within
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> political circles which is pressing
                        for moves to accommodate with Hanoi and Peking.</p>
                    <p>While it may be argued that the first alternative role for Thailand would
                        have the advantage of insulating the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment, the same argument can be
                        made for this second alternative. There is little evidence today that either
                        North Vietnam or the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> have any intention
                        in the foreseeable future of attacking Thailand. There is little reason to
                        suppose that they would expand their ambitions and develop such an intention
                        if North Vietnamese forces should come nearer to <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251"
                            facs="0300"/>Thai borders. On the other hand, should Thai military
                        forces, at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> behest and with heavy <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> subsidy, become a major obstacle to North
                        Vietnamese objectives <hi rend="italic">within Indochina</hi>, North Vietnam
                        and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> could well be provoked into a
                        more hostile attitude toward Thailand and even into military threats. Such
                        threats would probably cause the Thai to turn to the United States for
                        further reassurances, possibly including deterrent military actions to
                        support our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment. The second
                        alternative would probably be preferable to the first in reducing the risk
                        of having our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment put to the
                        test in this manner as a result of Thai provocation.</p>
                    <p>There are of course limits to the degree the United States can determine
                        Thailand's role in the region and further limits to what the Executive
                        Branch in the United States can do in the face of current American political
                        trends. To the extent that we can rationally plan <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> policy and exert influence on Thailand however, our
                        interests would be best served by a policy which pushed Thailand in the
                        direction of the second alternative described above. The first alternative
                        would lead, without real hope of success, toward continuation of the Cold
                        War divisions in Asia of previous decades. The second alternative would
                        contribute to a more flexible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> diplomatic
                        posture that will be appropriate to the multi-power system that we now see
                        emerging in East Asia. Most important, this role for Thailand would be
                        compatible with current <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assessment of our
                        real interests in Southeast Asia, with our national reluctance to become
                        involved again in ground combat in that theatre and with our desire to
                        expand and normalize relations with the Peoples Republic of China.</p>

                    <p>Dear Alex:</p>
                    <p>You may remember a rather special operation which was conducted here in 1968
                        and early 1969 on a very limited basis, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of</hi>
                        <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0301"/>
                        <hi rend="italic">source text not declassified</hi>]. Most correspondence
                        with Washington was carried on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>], with a code word [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and I can give you in
                        that connection a specific reference to my close-out message on the subject
                        which was [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] of about February 10, 1969.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d2">Documents 2</ref> and <ref

                    </p>
                    <p>The reason I am raising this matter is because [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] has again come to me with a request [<hi
                            rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        that we engage in a similar operation, involving about the same magnitude of
                        funds and serving the same general purposes. In this case, the purpose is
                        not quite so immediately related to the elections which are not due to take
                        place here until 1973, but rather to building up of the government political
                        party, the Saha Pracha Thai (United Thai People's Party), having those
                        elections, of course, ultimately in view.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] reviewed many of the same
                        considerations he had put forward before, such as that [<hi rend="italic">1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>] do not want the government
                        party to become beholden to wealthy businessmen for funds lest they run into
                        the kinds of problems currently faced by, among others, the Philippines.
                        Neither do they want to make improper use of <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> budgeted funds. [<hi rend="italic">21/2 lines of source
                            text not declassified</hi>] said he has and would continue to be putting
                        some of his own money into this as would the others who were able to do so;
                        however, the requirements were beyond their resources.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] emphasized how enormously
                        useful our help had been previously. On the political side he said that [<hi
                            rend="italic">11/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>], the
                        government party can provide stability in Thailand for some time to come. He
                        referred to many years of close cooperation with the U.S. and the assurance
                        that this would continue and the strong implication that our interests would
                        also be served by the continuing dominance of the local political scene by
                        the government party.</p>
                    <p>Obviously [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] approach raises two
                        questions: Do we have a means of providing help [<hi rend="italic">less than
                            1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], and do we consider it in
                        the U.S. interest to do this? The first point can only be answered in
                        Washington. As for the second, I have my doubts.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, this is a very delicate business to be engaged in and
                        should it ever become public knowledge there would be acute embarrassment
                            <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0302"/>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>]. It is quite true that the
                        last time the matter was handled successfully without any leaks whatsoever,
                        but you can never be sure. In the second place, I strongly suspect that if
                        money is really needed, some of the well-heeled government party supporters
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] could find the money without getting it from us. Finally,
                        I think it is probably inadvisable for us at this time to be making such an
                        implied political commitment to the government party. To be sure, our close
                        working relationship is of great importance to us, particularly as long as
                        we have thousands of servicemen still in-country and the need to use Thai
                        bases. I don't, however, see our cooperation as hanging on whether we do or
                        don't provide this help, nor do I think this help is likely to be critical
                        to the success or failure of the government party in the next election.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] asked me [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] to support his
                        request in Washington. I told him only that I would report it, mentioning
                        that I would probably be in touch with you in the first instance. [<hi
                            rend="italic">21/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] I would
                        appreciate at least your preliminary reaction at an early date. I am sending

                    <p>1. Immediately after call on <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> May
                        27, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> met with
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat Khoman</persName>. Also
                        present were Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                        >Green</persName>, Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWH1"
                            >Sullivan</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName>, <gloss target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss> Colebaugh, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s Secretary Birabhongse
                        Kasemsri.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said the Thai look on <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop reductions in the region as
                        implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said the prime
                        American objective was to keep from using American manpower. The Thai agreed
                        and are using their own men and resources, but they need outside
                        help—economic, technical and logistical help. But now it appears that there
                        will be no American manpower and no economic support either. The Under
                        Secretary explained that the problem arises from anti-war elements who want
                        to move in every way to stop the war immediately. However, the
                        administration believes in building up our allies in Europe, Vietnam and
                        Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> commented that the problem is
                        deeper than just the anti-war groups, it is also a struggle between the
                        Executive and Legislative branches of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        Government. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>
                        agreed, but pointed out that the struggle arose over Vietnam and desire of
                        Congress to curb the war powers of the President, and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> commented on the make-up and
                        tactics of the anti-war movement.</p>
                    <p>4. Replying to a question on the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> position
                        during the recent talks on repatriation of Vietnamese refugees, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_NVN1"
                            >NVN</gloss>
                        <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0304"/>continued to accuse others of
                        intervention while refusing to talk about their own. There is not much hope
                        that they will argue reasonably. Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said there are two kinds of
                        negotiations, the kind we are conducting in Paris, the kind the Thais are
                        conducting here. In the second kind, one side takes tacit steps and then
                        awaits response of the other side. Taking Cambodia for example, <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> noted that Thailand uses minimal force
                        in providing tactical air support to Cambodia, but holds its deterrent force
                        on Thai territory. This appears to have kept the war from Thailand's
                        borders. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> remarked that the Thai
                        are looking for ways to open reasoned discussions to reduce hostilities. In
                        this regard, Chinese appear more flexible than North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>5. The Under Secretary then explained the background behind recent moves in
                        US–China relations. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> does not expect
                        China to change her goals, but hopes that by coming out of isolation and
                        resuming contact with rest of the world, China will begin to conduct herself
                        according to internationally accepted modes of conduct. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> commented that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would have a better chance to improve
                        relations with China if Congressmen and Senators were not hampering his
                        efforts. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>
                        pointed out that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                        position on China has majority support.</p>
                    <p>6. The Foreign Minister asked if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has
                        taken a firm decision on China policy. The Under Secretary replied that no
                        decision has been made, but one is expected soon. Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> noted the belief encountered
                        in Cambodia that ping-pong diplomacy might have some damaging effect in
                        Southeast Asia, particularly on their own situation. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said he and the Prime Minister
                        understood what the United States purposes were even if some politicians
                        were critical. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that there
                        is not likely to be any change soon, that gradually over the long term
                        contact with the outside should lessen China's sense of alienation from the
                        world. He cited the recent prompt return of the hijacked Philippine aircraft
                        and of a yacht which had strayed into Chinese waters, as examples of the new
                        approach taken by China.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said the Thai will try to
                        persuade the Chinese to stop providing arms to Communist insurgents in
                        Thailand, and to stop infiltrating men. He noted that Communist propaganda
                        has diminished, but has not ceased. If the Chinese really changed their
                        policy, for example, by a change of position in the Paris negotiations,
                        Thailand will get the message that Communist China plans to play its part in
                        the area. Thailand hopes eventually to involve China in a Bandung-type
                        conference, which <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> thought would
                        mean that Communist China had shifted back to a foreign policy similar to
                        the pre-Bandung period.</p>
                    <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0305"/>
                    <p>8. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> raised the
                        issue of Chinese representation at the United Nations. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> remarked that this is a very
                        difficult problem for Thailand, especially because the Republic of China is
                        inflexible on the subject. In response to comments from the Under Secretary
                        and Assistant Secretary that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is
                        aware it must change tactics, <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                        remained firm in his view that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is
                        inflexible and thinks in very simplistic terms. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName> noted that Thailand has not changed its policy on
                        China—”not yet, anyway.” It was agreed that we will keep the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> in touch with our thinking on the question
                        through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d121fn3">After meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                                >Thanat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>
                            met with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Development
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote Sarasin</persName> for 15 minutes.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> discussed the concern
                            expressed at the U.S. East Asian chiefs of mission conference about the
                            lack of Japanese aid in Southeast Asia. He stated that it was felt that
                            what the Japanese called aid “appears to be largely commercial credits.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> observed that the
                            Japanese should be able to do more and that the Thai looked on the
                            Japanese as “ghosts.” (Telegram 7420 from Bangkok, May 28; National

                                “<persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> generally adhered to

                    <p>1. Following is cleared record of Under Secretary's conversation May 27 in
                        Bangkok with Thai Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom
                            Kittikachorn</persName> on Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>

                    <p>2. After general discussion of security situation in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,
                        and Thailand, Under Secretary raised question of Congressional restrictions
                        on use of funds. Because of these restrictions funds have been provided
                        through [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] to support Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>
                        units in Laos. The Under Secretary asked for Thai views on the issue, noting
                        that Senators <persName corresp="#p_CCP1">Case</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> have raised the <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> publicly, and that it may be necessary for
                        Assistant Secretary Green to testify before Congress. In such event, and
                        although in executive session, the Assistant Secretary would have to testify
                        truthfully and candidly. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                            >Irwin</persName> expressed gratitude for what the Thai have done, and
                        regret for the publicity.</p>
                    <p>3. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> commented
                        with irony that everything had come out already, and attributed this to fact
                        that two former Foreign Service officers, Lowenstein and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRM1">Moose</persName>, had unearthed the information for
                        the Senate. (After the meeting, Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> and Deputy Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> pointed out to <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s private secretary, Birabhongse
                        Kasemsri, our inability to control the actions or statements of Lowenstein
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MRM1">Moose</persName> in their present status.)
                        The Under Secretary again stated the regret of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> for the publicity. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> again remarked that, as virtually all
                        has been revealed already, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName>'s testimony shouldn't have a great deal more impact.
                        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> explained
                        that anti-war elements in the U.S. will try to prove that funds have been
                        used illegally, and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> explained how his testimony may well have to go beyond
                        what has already appeared in the press and cover in specific detail some of
                        the arrangements which are not now public knowledge.</p>
                    <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> called attention

                            target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces but no regular Thai forces are
                        there. He suggested that this provided a satisfactory general basis for our
                        answers to queries. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> responded
                        that he has used this formula, and that no regular Thai troops are in Laos.
                        He emphasized that such <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> cadre as are
                        with the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> units have officially signed
                        resignations from the Thai army, and that all persons now in Laos are
                        “volunteers” [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                    <p>5. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> pointed
                        out that there are two sides to the issue—a legal side and a political side.
                        Leaving aside the legal aspect, it is important to argue the question on the
                        basis of why the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> units are used, in
                        terms of the protection of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces in
                        Vietnam and the fact that the countries of the area are helping one another
                        in accordance with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that this should
                        also carry a signal to the other side, and asked the Foreign Minister if
                        such <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0307"/>a signal acted as a deterrent
                        to <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName> did not reply directly, but remarked that both the
                        Chinese and the North Vietnamese had accused the Thai of enlarging the war.
                        These accusations have been made not only in propaganda attacks but from
                        private sources speaking on behalf of the Chinese and North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>6. This meeting also provided an opportunity to call attention to General
                        Sanga's remarks (<gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 93462)<note n="2"

                    <p>1. Following is cleared record of discussion of narcotics problem which took
                        place during call by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"

                    <p>2. At close of call on Prime Minister, the Under Secretary expressed
                        appreciation for Thai cooperation during the recent visit of <gloss
                            target="#t_BNDD1">BNDD</gloss> director <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">John
                            Ingersoll</persName>, and noted U.S. concern over the increased
                        availability of heroin to our troops in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                        He noted that the major sources are in Burma, Laos, and Southern China, and
                        that major traffic routes run through Laos and Thailand. Congress and those
                        opposed to the Vietnam War will also use the drug question to arouse further
                        opposition to the war. The Prime Minister responded that ever since the
                        President and Vice President visited Thailand, the Thai have done what they
                        could to help. He noted, however, that when even a big, powerful country
                        like the U.S. has a problem controlling drugs, <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259"
                            facs="0308"/>Thailand with its limited means finds it very difficult to

                        expressed our understanding of the problem for the Thai. He also mentioned
                        the joint U.S.-Thai committee on which <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>

                                >Thanom</persName> that morning on “the alarming increase in drug

                            ships, ostensibly engaged in fishing, that leave Thai ports daily and
                            rendezvous with other traffickers offshore from Hong Kong.” <persName

                    </list>
                    <p>My trip to Southeast Asia strengthened my belief in the value of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, not only as the
                        best means of pursuing U.S. policy objectives in Asia, but also as a formula
                        for developing self-reliance and determination in the Southeast Asian
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Those themes emerged again and again in conversations with government leaders
                        in Viet-Nam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. They all emphasize the continuing
                        need for U.S. military and economic assistance, but most seem prepared and
                        even anxious to do more for their own defense and development. They also
                        seem somewhat more willing to face the internal and international
                        implications of drugs and corruption, particularly as those issues bear on
                        the willingness and the ability of our government to sustain its effort in
                        their behalf.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Vietnam and Laos.]</p>
                    <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0309"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Thailand</p>
                    <p>Thailand has a special importance in the security of Southeast Asia, both for
                        its own sake and for the assistance the Thai are providing and may be able
                        to provide to the defense of Laos and Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>As you know, Thai regular army troops have all been replaced in northern Laos
                        by Thai Special Guerrilla Units (<gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s).
                            <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> speaks of the
                        effectiveness of these <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s primarily in a
                        defensive or consolidating role, thus freeing Meo and Lao <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s for offensive operations. The Thai, along
                        with U.S. air power, have been a key factor in resisting North Vietnamese
                        attacks on Long Tieng. There are at present 10 Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss> battalions (approximately 3,500 men) in northern Laos with
                        4 more battalions now being trained.</p>
                    <p>Although the Lao need and want the help of the Thai, they show some concern
                        about the long-term objectives of Thailand regarding those areas of Laos
                        which once were Thai. We heard occasional comments to the effect that the
                        Thai may be eventually almost as difficult to evacuate from the country as
                        the North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>The Cambodians too view the prospect of Thai troops in their western
                        provinces (which also once were under Thai rule) with some apprehension. At
                        the same time, they have welcomed the limited air support provided by the
                        Thai.</p>
                    <p>In both Laos and Cambodia, the Thai appear to be concerned about the risks of
                        direct confrontation with Hanoi. While desiring to avoid direct
                        confrontation, they are hoping that the use of their <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>'s in northern Laos and their limited air sorties in
                        Cambodia will signal to the North Vietnamese the seriousness with which
                        Thailand views Hanoi's approach to Thai borders. During my meeting with
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom Kittikachorn</persName>,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_SM5">Surakit Mayalap</persName>, Chief of
                        Staff of the Royal Thai Army, gave a briefing on the military situation in
                        which he stressed the serious Thai concern over Hanoi's approach to Thai
                        borders.</p>
                    <p>While the Thai need encouragement to continue their support to Laos and
                        Cambodia, we should be alert to avoid the development of a situation
                        vis-à-vis the North Vietnamese that might prompt the Thai to invoke our
                            <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment at a time when public
                        and Congressional attitudes inevitably raise a question as to our ability
                        effectively to meet that commitment.</p>
                    <p>The Thai and North Vietnamese have been engaging in negotiations in Bangkok
                        for some months, ostensibly with respect to the repatriation of Vietnamese
                        who have settled in northeastern Thailand, but undoubtedly touching on wider
                        issues. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> told
                        us frankly that the Thai have been trying to feel out both Hanoi and Peking,
                        and acknowledged that Thai actions in Laos and Cambodia <pb n="261"
                            xml:id="pg_261" facs="0310"/>have been designed in part as a tacit
                        negotiating process in which the Thai have been attempting to signal Hanoi.
                        Although the repatriation talks have now been broken off and the North
                        Vietnamese delegation has returned home, it would seem that the Thai, in
                        traditional fashion, remain willing to cover their bets by talking with
                        North Viet-Nam or China when an opportunity arises.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Heroin</p>
                    <p>In all conversations with government officials in Viet-Nam, Laos and
                        Thailand, I stressed the deep concern of the U.S. Government over heroin and
                        its impact on U.S. troops and the imperative need for action by the
                        governments of the three countries. In Viet-Nam and Laos, the groups
                        involved in the heroin trade seem to have high level protection and often to
                        be more or less immune from local police enforcement. On the other hand, the
                        leaders with whom we met gave the appearance of understanding the
                        seriousness of the drug traffic and evidenced a desire to act to suppress
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In Viet-Nam, President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> has taken
                        initial steps toward better enforcement in response to representations made
                        by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>. In Laos, after
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GGMM1">Godley</persName> and I spoke to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, he assured us
                        that new legislation aimed at controlling the trade in opium and its
                        derivatives would be passed by the National Assembly in the near future. In
                        Thailand, at the instigation of our Embassy, a joint U.S.-Thai planning
                        group is to be formed to develop plans to control the drug traffic in that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the attitude expressed by <persName corresp="#p_NVT3"
                            >Thieu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>, it seems unlikely, given
                        the high level involvement in the drug traffic in both South Viet-Nam and
                        Laos, that domestic forces alone will be sufficient. If some external police
                        authority, perhaps under the cover of an international body such as the
                        United Nations or Interpol were feasible, it might offer additional hope for
                        positive action. The Department will explore this idea. In selected cases,
                        the United States might also consider encouraging the use of guerrilla
                        forces against identified processing facilities.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> in response to the President's guideline
                        to the agencies (<gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 89 on Cambodia,
                        October 26, 1971) that, in recognition of possible dry season threats,
                        “contingency plans should be developed with Thailand for the possible
                        deployment of Thai forces to aid in the defense of western Cambodia.”</p>
                    <p>Proposed to the Thai in April (five months after the <gloss target="#t_NSDM1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> and well into the dry season we were concerned about), the
                        STFD package contains the following principal elements of program
                        assistance:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Foreign Military Sales Credit</hi>—We would provide up to
                        $12 million in credit to finance Thai purchases of military goods from the
                        United States. Most of these goods, consumables, would be in support of Thai
                        air force operations in Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">PL 480</hi>—We would provide $20 million of agricultural
                        commodities over the next two years. This assistance would save Thai foreign
                        exchange expenditures. The foreign exchange savings would offset the Thai
                        purchase from the U.S. of ammunition and other consumables under the foreign
                        military <hi rend="italic">sales</hi> credit program. <gloss

                            would be very helpful in gaining Thai acceptance of STFD.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> suggested that this reduction
                            could be justified by reduced number of sorties forecast for <gloss

                        is balking because it is:</p>
                    <p>—uncertain about the benefits of military deployments and preparedness which
                        we have linked specifically to Cambodia when Thai concern is much more
                        focused on the insurgency and on developments in Laos;</p>
                    <p>—confused about the complicated assistance trade-off and offset mechanism
                        associated with the proposed assistance imposed by our legal
                        restrictions.</p>
                    <p>The STFD proposal was poorly conceived from the beginning. We have received
                        the very distinct impression that the motivation of some individuals
                        involved in its design, who are against any external role for the Thai, was
                        simply to provide a “sop to <persName>Henry</persName>,” perhaps knowing all
                        along that the proposal would bring little or no results. It is, at best,
                        one more illustration of the ad hoc piecemeal manner with which we provide
                        assistance to Thailand. The White House guidance on the program was
                        consistently of the “we don't care about the details—get on with it”
                        variety.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Real Issues</p>

                        rapid additions of trained and skilled personnel to the force.</p>
                    <p>It does not provide the Thai with any indication of our long-run intentions
                        with respect to Thai defense support. <hi rend="italic">In effect nothing

                    <p>—(1) <hi rend="italic">The Threat</hi>. The overriding consideration that
                        bears on the content or timing of STFD or alternative proposals is that the
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is capable of sustaining probably no
                        more than the equivalent of ten battalions in combat—the approximate force
                        currently operating against the insurgents. With this limited capability the
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> faces:</p>

                        already deployed in North Laos. The Thai could, with the South Vietnamese,
                        deploy to interdict supply movements in the panhandle and divert <gloss
                            target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces
                        from targets in Cambodia and South Vietnam as in Lam Son 719. But in my
                        opinion a principal obstacle to Thai deployments is the paucity of Thai
                        ground force capability.</p>
                    <p>—(2) <hi rend="italic">Deployment Sustainability</hi>. Thai deployments
                        out-of-country in Vietnam and in Laos have been sustained by U.S. personnel
                        giving direct logistics support as well as financial assistance. By itself
                        the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> at present could probably sustain no
                        more than 8–10 battalions in combat out-of-country and then only at the
                        sacrifice of deployments against the insurgents in-country. Thus, while we
                        may be able to buy additional Thai deployments, the price will be an
                        expansion of the American logistics support presence in Thailand or a
                        reduction in Thai deployments against the insurgents. If we or the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> are unwilling to pay this price, then
                        additional out-of-country deployments can only be obtained with improvements
                        in the Thai's own deployment capability, e.g., extensive manpower
                        recruitment, training and advancement, and logistics infrastructure
                        improvement.</p>
                    <p>—(3) <hi rend="italic">Local Currency Support for the Thai Military
                            Budget</hi>. Shortages of personnel, particularly trained officers and
                            <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s appear to be a binding constraint

                            facs="0314"/>overcome these shortages, large increases in local currency
                        expenditures in the military budget will be necessary. Without a substantial
                        U.S. contribution, it is unlikely that the Thai will undertake these
                        expenditures because of the declining economic situation. Inasmuch as our
                        programs in the past have been for military imports rather than local
                        currency support, improvements in Thai defense capability will require a
                        major program change for the U.S. and significant increases in U.S. costs,
                        e.g., U.S. costs for Thai ground forces in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        72 including financing for additional imports could reach $150–200 million

                    <p>We are confronted with basically two alternatives:</p>
                    <p>—(1) <hi rend="italic">Persist with STFD</hi>, continuing to offer some or
                        all of the proposed assistance with the knowledge that we are buying little
                        or nothing in the way of increased Thai defense capability or
                        deployments.</p>
                    <p>—(2) <hi rend="italic">Extract ourselves from STFD</hi>, minimizing the
                        political costs as necessary. Inform the Thai that we are re-evaluating our
                        assistance proposals in the context of recent developments in Cambodia and
                        Laos, and in their insurgency. And tell them that we will be ready to
                        discuss with them, in the near future, additional U.S. assistance in <gloss

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> began by commenting on
                        the improvements in the security situation in South Vietnam. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that he had
                        received similar reports from the Thai soldiers in Vietnam. He noted that
                        the first members of the Thai contingent which was returning from Vietnam
                        had arrived that day and that the main body would be returning on July
                        22.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> about the status of the insurgency
                        in Northeast Thailand. General Praphat stated that things were going quite
                        well, and that the Thai forces were now able to handle <pb n="267"
                            xml:id="pg_267" facs="0316"/>the insurgents. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> wondered if General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>'s estimate included the Chieng Rai
                        area. Had the situation there quieted down? General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> replied that things had been
                        better during the past month.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> requested General
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>'s views on the situation
                        in Vietnam. According to General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName>, everything seemed to be quiet, but this made him
                        suspicious. He anticipated that if the U.S. negotiations with the Communists
                        were not successful, the Communists would undertake a new act of aggression.
                        The North Vietnamese had the capacity for this.</p>
                    <p>Asked by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for his
                        estimate of developments in Laos, General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName> said that the situation there depended very much on
                        the situation in Vietnam. If there was peace in Vietnam, then the same
                        condition would apply to Laos. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> said that he was not so sure—if things were quiet
                        in Vietnam, the Communists would be able to shift forces to Laos. It was too
                        early to tell about the negotiations. What the Communists had proposed was
                        unacceptable. They were asking us to stop all aid to the Government in
                        Saigon, which we could not do. We would not overthrow the government with
                        which we had been working for so long. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName> asked if cessation of aid meant both military and
                        economic assistance, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> replied that this was the implication of their
                        demand. They were phrasing their proposals in a very complicated way,
                        speaking like oracles to every Congressman who went to Paris; these then
                        thought they had the road to peace. The North Vietnamese were speaking to
                        them in ambiguities.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that he didn't
                        know the detailed language of the Communist proposals, but from what he had
                        heard and read in the newspapers he did not have the impression that the
                        seven points would include a limitation on aid. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained that they were putting
                        their proposals in a complicated way. Their requirement that we cease all
                        aid to the <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> Government was
                        interpreted by us as meaning that we had to stop all economic and military
                        assistance. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> remarked
                        that after reading the newspaper articles about the seven points, he had
                        thought the U.S. would accept them. He felt that we had an obligation to
                        accept them quickly. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        described the Vietnam situation as being extremely complicated, and foresaw
                        the possibility of serious negotiations later on this year. He felt that
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> was correct,
                        however, in sensing that the Communists were in a slightly better bargaining
                        attitude now than in the past. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName> said that, speaking as a military man, long
                        negotiations were undesirable because the enemy would gain more time to
                        prepare for an attack against Thailand. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> agreed, but noted that unfavorable negotiations
                        would also be undesirable.</p>
                    <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0317"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> wondered if the
                        United States was considering reducing its military strength in the area.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that we had some
                        difficult domestic problems. There was no question but that we had a number
                        of Senators who were making a great deal of noise and were behaving in a way
                        which made the conduct of foreign policy difficult. Nevertheless, the
                        President was convinced that we had to maintain our military posture in
                        Asia. In Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s opinion the
                        domestic situation had improved, and opposition to the Administration's
                        policy had reached a high point. There was every possibility that we would
                        not be in a better situation.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that
                        negotiations were one thing, but after the rainy season the situation in
                        Cambodia and Laos might be a good deal worse. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted our judgment was that the
                        South Vietnamese would be able to hold out in Cambodia against the North
                        Vietnamese and would be stronger than the North Vietnamese. However, the
                        situation in Laos was different. Whenever the North Vietnamese wanted to put
                        more troops in they could advance. Therefore, in Laos we had to work with
                        the Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s and with the Lao Government
                        forces. We attached great value to what the Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>s were doing and strongly supported this effort.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d126fn2">According to a July 3 memorandum of conversation, U.S.

                                >Kissinger</persName> that “the successful defense of Long Tieng”
                            was due “to the performance of the Thai troops. The Thai were very good
                            at digging in and fighting defensively. These forces were all <gloss

                            soldier) and which was now dug in “and spoiling for a fight.” (Ibid.,
                            Box 564, Country Files, Far East, Thailand, Vol. VII)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> remarked that he had
                        some doubt about the South Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, which were not too
                        effective because of the way that they had been put in, pulled out and put
                        in again. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that
                        he didn't debate military strategy with a General, because the General might
                        start debating academic points with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> as an academician. We believed, though, that
                        during the rainy season there was not much sense in leaving the South
                        Vietnamese in Cambodia. They had established a line along Route 7, from
                        which they would push north when the dry season arrived, although they would
                        not go farther than the line of the Mekong. General Praphat observed that
                        this strategy might be good for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam,
                        but still left the Cambodians with the requirement to fight west of the
                        Mekong. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that this
                        was true, but the North Vietnamese had a supply problem in maintaining their
                        forces west of the Mekong in heavy strength and at the same time fighting
                            <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0318"/>the South Vietnamese east of
                        the Mekong. So far, they hadn't been able to do this and probably couldn't
                        do it next year, either.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said he assumed that
                        the North Vietnamese would be able to use the <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho
                            Chi Minh</persName> Trail to supply their troops in Cambodia and South
                        Vietnam. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that
                        they indeed could do so, and had expanded the Trail. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>s could not defend against this, neither the Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s nor the others (“neither ours nor yours”).
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed the view that
                        the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s could at least do something to
                        harass the <persName corresp="#p_HCM2">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> stated that the Thai
                        would be unable to sustain their <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                        without aid from the U.S. side, and for this needed “total support”. In
                        response to comments from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName> that we felt on our side we were rendering such
                        support, General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> commented
                        that a great deal of time had been wasted in bargaining. Furthermore, there
                        had been difficulties in receiving U.S. air support and medivac. With some
                        bitterness, he said that Thai wounded had waited for five days for medivac,
                        and none had arrived until he had made a special plea to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>. There was a problem also
                        for the Thai to fight. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        noted that we hadn't heard of these problems in Washington. We wanted the
                        Thai to succeed and he, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>, would look into the situation as soon as he
                        returned.</p>
                    <p>General Praphat continued by outlining a few more difficulties in receiving
                        air support. Requests had been put in on the ground which had gone to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, who had in turn
                        said the requests should have been presented to the U.S. military in Laos
                        and to the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] group. What had been sent was not enough. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> declared that no one had
                        asked him to take care of the wounded, and if this issue had been raised he
                        would have handled it. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        assured General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> that this
                        matter would be looked into, and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName> and Washington were in full agreement on the <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> remarked that he
                        understood the political problems which the U.S. faced, but that the Thai
                        had a political problem in their country, too. There was the question of
                        economic support, and also that of the attitude of the Thai Parliament. Some
                        politicians had wanted to pull all Thai out of Laos.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the subject of medivac for the Thai in Laos, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he thought this had
                        been approved and that no problem existed. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> noted that all he had known of the
                        medical problem was that there had been a large number of Thai wounded who
                        had been taken care of at Udorn. There was a field hospital there which had
                        been scheduled for closure; he had stopped the closing and had kept the
                        facility open for a considerable time to take <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270"
                            facs="0319"/>care of the wounded. He had not heard of the medivac
                        difficulties. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said
                        that this had been but one example of the difficulties the Thai had faced.
                        He and General Sirikit jointly explained that another difficulty had been
                        encountered over artillery support—they had needed and asked for 155s, but
                        had received 105s; they had wanted six guns per battery and received four
                        instead; they had requested an ammunition supply, but had been told to draw
                        ammunition from Thai Army depots. There had been many complications. This is
                        why they had spoken of needing full support for the <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss> program. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> once again said that he would look into the
                        matter, and that he had not been aware of these details. He was under the
                        impression the Thai had been getting everything they asked for. Who were
                        they dealing with? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                        said that questions such as these were normally handled [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] not through
                        Thailand. He wanted to know whenever things were not going well, however,
                        because he wanted to give his full support. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> added that he would talk to responsible people and
                        make sure that all the various complaints were looked into. General Sirikit
                        remarked here that he hoped all this wouldn't appear in U.S. newspapers.</p>
                    <p>On the score of press and public opinion in the U.S., General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> questioned whether the U.S. people
                        were actually supporting their country. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> expressed the view that the people were behind the
                        Administration, it was just the intellectuals and a few Senators who were
                        causing the trouble. He discounted an observation by General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> that the morale of the U.S. people
                        was poor. The popular morale was good.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> made what he called
                        “a final plea” with respect to U.S. aid to Thailand: that there be no
                        reduction in this aid. Thailand remained a staunch friend of the U.S., and
                        unlike the situation in other countries, the U.S. Embassy in Thailand had
                        never been stoned. The Thai Government was working very hard to improve
                        U.S.-Thai relations. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        declared that he was very conscious of the pressures on Thailand. The
                        President urgently wanted Thailand to be helped, and was committed to
                        maintaining close ties. In this respect, he, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, was aware of the problems which had developed in
                        our program for providing close assistance to the Thai in strengthening
                        their defenses. (General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>
                        agreed that such problems did, in fact, exist.) He would promise that when
                        he went back to Washington in July, a package would be developed which would
                        please the Thai. The President wanted this. We wanted to provide the maximum
                        aid possible, but had to employ many different ways to provide our aid
                        because of the legal restrictions imposed upon us. Nevertheless, a program
                        different from what we and the Thai had been discussing would be
                        developed.</p>
                    <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0320"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> expressed his thanks
                        for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s offer on
                        providing maximum help. He again referred to Thai efforts to gain the
                        support of public opinion in Thailand for working with the U.S. This was
                        occasionally difficult, for when the U.S. made moves toward improving
                        relations with Red China, the people became confused. The people were also
                        upset about the rice situation—they worked very hard to produce rice, and
                        then the U.S. came along and took their markets.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> concluded by saying that
                        we definitely understood the Thai problems. He normally would check with the
                        President on matters such as had been discussed this evening, but he was so
                        close to the President's thinking on aid to Thailand he knew that we could
                        move ahead.</p>

                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> opened by
                        discussing the situation in Laos. Military conditions seemed to have
                        improved with the arrival of the rainy season. Thailand would continue to
                        send <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s to help out in various places at
                        the request of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. Presently there were
                        eight infantry battalions in MR II and one artillery battalion; one infantry
                        battalion was in Sayaboury; and two infantry battalions were on the <pb
                            n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0321"/>Bolovens. It therefore appeared
                        appropriate to bring the number of <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s up
                        to the total number which had been requested. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> verified that this meant 36
                        battalions. He agreed that the situation in Laos had improved, noting that
                        Vang Pao's offensive in Northern Laos had captured a considerable amount of
                        equipment. Possibly this was due in part to the arrival of the rainy season.
                        In South Laos the situation was not as good. We of course strongly supported
                        the Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> effort. Was the process of
                        recruiting and training proceeding at the fastest rate? Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> and Air <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal Dawee</persName> agreed that the process was
                        being carried out at a rapid rate and that there was no problem in training
                        or recruitment. Nevertheless, units could not be trained in a matter of
                        weeks and advance preparations needed to be made to take care of filling out
                        the full 36 battalions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that we had made a
                        firm agreement to support 24 <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s, and
                        wondered when the decision would need to be made to proceed with the
                        additional 12. Air <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal Dawee</persName> said
                        that the Thai would need to know before October when the last of the 24
                        would complete training. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> stated that the decision would be made this summer
                        and certainly before September. We were very sympathetic toward the Thai
                            <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> program.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered whether the
                        Thai were planning to put some additional <gloss target="#t_SGU1"
                            >SGU</gloss>s into South Laos. General Sirikit replied affirmatively.
                        Units would be put into the Champassak and Sithandone areas. According to
                        Air <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal Dawee</persName>, this area appeared
                        to be a new sanctuary for Communists infiltrating into Laos, Cambodia, and
                        Thailand. They had even developed hospitals there. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> described the Sayaboury area as being
                        another dangerous spot where <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s were
                        needed. The program for raising 36 <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s
                        would provide units for these areas and also for North Laos. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> added that units would also
                        be sent to the Bolovens. An operation was planned for July to retake Paksong
                        and set up a strong protective shield east of the Mekong.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered whether the
                        Thai would have enough time to recruit and train if the decision on the 36
                            <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s was made before September. Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said that the time
                        would be adequate provided there was no interference from Administration
                        critics. On this, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        commented that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                        and the Administration faced the same problems. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> referred to the very heavy burden
                        which the Thai had to bear in the security field and hoped that the U.S.
                        Government and people would show understanding and not be critical.
                        According to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>,
                        Administration critics would be just as unhappy with 24 <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s as with 36, and their attitude was related
                        to the facts of the matter and not to the number. With respect to the
                        defense of Thailand, the President has <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273"
                            facs="0322"/>been personally interested in our working out a
                        satisfactory arrangement. He, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, had had a long discussion the previous day with
                        the Deputy Prime Minister on this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SKW1"
                            >Smith</persName> of his staff would stay behind in Bangkok and work out
                        a program with the Embassy which hopefully would be a satisfactory
                        arrangement for the Thai. He wanted very much to show his appreciation for
                        the Thai contributions in Laos.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> expressed some
                        apprehension that despite certain improvements in the military situation in
                        Indo-China, the Communists might concentrate their efforts against the north
                        and northeast of Thailand, and even further south. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed the view that Hanoi had
                        been severely weakened by the war, and would need several years after a
                        settlement to recover. While there was no doubt that the Communists would
                        like to intensify their activities, they wouldn't be making peace
                        initiatives now if they were not under some pressure themselves. However, in
                        the long term the Prime Minister was right in anticipating a step-up in
                        Communist efforts against Thailand. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> explained that the reason the Thai
                        felt this way was that while the Communist resources were depleted in
                        Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, this was not true in Thailand. Here, the other
                        side could fight much better. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> said in response that taking on Thailand directly
                        would be a formidable undertaking for them, and they would probably try
                        instead to encourage the insurgency in northern and northeast Thailand. Our
                        experience was that the best time to fight an insurgency was in its early
                        stages when the enemy hadn't consolidated his bases.</p>
                    <p>According to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>, the
                        Communist side had increased its efforts and was waging a political and
                        propaganda campaign against the loyalty of the people in the north. On the
                        government side, it was necessary to show that the government would cater to
                        the people's needs by offering direct benefits such as schools, roads, and
                        economic aid. Thailand's resources were affected by the price of its export
                        commodities. On the one hand, exports were decreasing, while on the other
                        Thailand's needs were increasing; accordingly a better balance of resources
                        on the economic side was required. If <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                            >PL–480</gloss> assistance in the neighborhood of $30 million over a
                        two-to-three-year period could be obtained, this could be of some help.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_SSG2">Sawaeng</persName> had already discussed
                        a <gloss target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> agreement with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he would review matters
                        such as this on his return, and would report to the President not only on
                        his general impressions but on specific issues. The President had a special
                        interest in Thailand and the Thai could be assured that he was most
                        sympathetic with respect to the Thai needs. He, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, knew that the Thai had a special
                        situation, and he hoped that we could respond economically. The <gloss
                            target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> matter would be looked at in
                        particular.</p>
                    <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0323"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> wondered if Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was aware that the Lao
                        Government had more or less decided to negotiate with the Pathet Lao? Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he was
                        aware something was going on, but was not aware of the Lao attitude—did they
                        really want to settle, or were they doing this because it was expected of
                        them? Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> remarked
                        that Prince <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> had previously
                        insisted that all North Vietnamese troops had to be taken out but now had
                        “relented.” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said his
                        impression was that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> didn't
                        really expect any results. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> thought that the talks might lead to an agreement on
                        a cease-fire. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if
                        this meant just the Plaine des Jarres area, or all of Laos? What about the
                        bombing of the Trail? Would they ask us to stop? Our Ambassador in Laos had
                        said “no” to all these questions. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> agreed, saying that as long as the Pathet Lao and
                        North Vietnamese forces were attacking, he didn't think <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> would ask the U.S. to stop
                        bombing.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> explained <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName>'s position as being that he didn't
                        have authority over south and southeast Laos and couldn't control what was
                        happening there. He had not advocated ending the bombing. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, adding that if <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> did accept a bombing halt, a very
                        difficult situation would be created for the U.S. The war was divided into
                        two parts, the North and the South. In the North, it was conceivable that
                        the North Vietnamese would stop attacking and agree to a cease-fire.
                        However, there was a different situation in the South. In response to a
                        question from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> on
                        whether or not a stand-still cease-fire was possible in Laos, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that it would be easier
                        in the North, since the situation was subject to <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                            >Souvanna</persName>'s influence. There was a different problem in South
                        Laos, though, since this area was related to the war in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked whether
                        during Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s meeting with
                        Vice President Ky, Ky had said anything about the North Vietnamese proposals
                        being acceptable to him. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> explained that Ky had not actually spoken in such
                        terms. He had simply said he had gone through these proposals and that those
                        dealing with the U.S. withdrawal were acceptable so long as U.S. military
                        assistance could continue. His position was that U.S. forces were not needed
                        except for air power. Ky's statement was somewhat ambiguous—he didn't say
                        all seven points were acceptable, just the point on the withdrawal of the
                        U.S. forces.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that
                        what was important in these proposals was how we should interpret the demand
                        that we cease support for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. If the
                        Communists meant we must stop all economic and military assistance, there
                        would be a problem. Another problem <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0324"
                        />concerned the cease-fire. If the cease-fire would apply only to the U.S.,
                        then the Communists could put in all their forces against the South
                        Vietnamese. We couldn't accept this. It would be dishonorable for us if we
                        withdrew in safety while the Communists attacked our friends. However, it
                        would be acceptable if all forces were included in a cease-fire. We had
                        proposed such a cease-fire on October 7. If the two issues of aid and the
                        cease-fire could be settled, the element of a fixed deadline would still not
                        be acceptable to us, however.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked if the
                        Communists had made any reference to the withdrawal of their own forces. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that they had
                        simply said that this would be settled “in a spirit of national concord.”
                        The South Vietnamese believed they could handle the North Vietnamese forces
                        as long as they could get continued U.S. military assistance. This was
                        probably true. The Communists formerly had denied they had any forces in
                        South Vietnam and were now implying they now did have forces there on the
                        basis of settling military problems in all of Vietnam. But their forces in
                        the South were not very strong any more, and they hadn't won a battle in the
                        South for several years because South Vietnamese firepower was so
                        superior.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked what Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> felt about the
                        prospects of the three presidential candidates. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> discounted his ability to know
                        the right answers about Vietnamese political affairs but observed that most
                        people thought that in a two-man race between <persName corresp="#p_NVT3"
                            >Thieu</persName> and Minh, <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>
                        would win; in a three-man race involving Ky as well, Ky would take votes
                        from <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>, but <persName
                            corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> would still win. Minh had some
                        popularity. He, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, had
                        spoken to all three candidates to establish his impartiality.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> expressed the
                        view that if <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> won, the situation
                        would be satisfactory, but if one of the others won, stability would be
                        affected. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he
                        had met no one who thought Ky had a chance, and the general assumption was
                        that <hi rend="italic">Ky</hi> was preparing for the 1975 elections. If Minh
                        won, he had already said he wanted to prosecute the war and had said
                        yesterday that he was absolutely opposed to a coalition government and
                        didn't want the Communists. There would be a change in the top
                        administrator, though. The big question was whether Minh would be a
                        competent administrator, not that there would be any change in policies. If
                        Minh proved not to be a good administrator, there might be some military
                        actions. The Thai had had Minh in Thailand for four years—what did they
                        think? Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> simply
                        observed that Minh had kept very quiet while in Thailand.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that Minh had told
                        him he was against a coalition government and opposed to the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRG1">PRG</gloss> seven-point program, which he felt was a
                        trick. Therefore, his views were not radically different <pb n="276"
                            xml:id="pg_276" facs="0325"/>from those of <persName corresp="#p_NVT3"
                            >Thieu</persName>. However, he wanted a broader-based government which
                        would, for example, bring the Buddhists in, and also wanted a program of
                        “social justice”. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        observed that opposition candidates were not usually distinguished by the

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> requested Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>'s views on policy toward
                        Communist China and on the U.S. position. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that if contacts between the
                        U.S. and Chinese should result in a lessening of China's expansionist
                        tendencies and support for wars of national liberation, the situation in
                        Southeast Asia would be improved. Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> remarked that the Chinese had
                        reaffirmed their support for national liberation movements a few months ago,
                        and had also attacked the U.S. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        Ambassador had given him their statement to this effect. He, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, had told the Prime Minister that
                        there was not much difference between the Chinese and Soviet policies.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that U.S. policy
                        toward China was <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that we had two common
                        enemies, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China, but
                        didn't see why we needed to support the stronger against the weaker. We
                        wanted contacts with both so we could moderate the policies of both, rather
                        than to let Moscow act as a spokesman. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we
                        also wanted to induce the Chinese to moderate their policy with respect to
                        Southeast Asia, which we believed we could do if we could focus Chinese
                        attention on the Soviet Union. We had no illusions about the Chinese and
                        would expect them to affirm their support for national liberation movements.
                            <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, we wanted to see if the Chinese might
                        possibly want to withdraw their opposition to a settlement in South Vietnam.
                        We were very unsentimental in our approach to China and looked at the
                        problem from the standpoint of what we could do with respect to Chinese
                        relations with the surrounding countries. We had no illusions that people
                        who were revolutionaries all their lives would be charmed by little gestures
                        such as trade, travel and ping pong teams.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that he felt
                        there was a greater relaxation and flexibility in Chinese policy, possibly
                        including policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In addition,
                        their increasing concern about the Soviet Union could create a better
                        balance in Peking. So far as the U.S. establishment of contacts with the
                        Chinese were concerned, the results were not yet in. There was a possibility
                        that Chinese might use trade to further their objectives. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that there was no
                        question but that the Chinese would look at everything from a political
                        standpoint. They could create difficulties in Southeast Asian countries
                        having large Chinese populations. From the U.S. point of view, we would do
                        what we could to improve the situation. The Chinese could use trade as a
                        weapon, for example, against Malaysia. But the <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277"
                            facs="0326"/>Soviet forces along the border with China were twice the
                        size of the Soviet forces in Europe, which was a somewhat unsettling factor
                        for the Chinese. Therefore, there was some possibility that they would
                        moderate their pressures against some countries such as Vietnam and
                        Thailand. Over the long run, we had a special problem in that all of the
                        Chinese leaders were 70 or above, and nobody could know what would happen
                        when the present leadership disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked if the
                        Sino-Soviet border was very long, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> noted that the total distance was 7,000 kilometers
                        even though the Chinese didn't recognize all of it. It was difficult to
                        speculate about Chinese developments, and certainly we were going to proceed
                        deliberately to see what the future would bring. We did not have much
                        expectation about U.S. trade with China. Our lifting of trade restrictions
                        had more of a symbolic purpose than anything else.</p>
                    <p>To a remark by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                        that the Soviets and the East Europeans appeared to have changed a bit, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered if the Thai
                        thought they could increase their trade with East Europe. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s reply was affirmative. The Soviets,
                        the Hungarians, the East Germans, and the Rumanians were all interested in
                        buying various Thai commodities.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he appreciated very
                        much the opportunity to exchange ideas with the Thai, and wanted to assure
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> again how firmly
                        committed the President was to Thailand. The Thai should remember that those
                        people who made all the noise did not formulate U.S. policy. We would get
                        decisions on the <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s and would see if we
                        could adjust the framework of support for the Thai defenses. Our proposals
                        would be reasonable. There was, in addition, one other problem which need
                        not be discussed at this level—that of narcotics, which was causing the U.S.
                        great concern. This had such emotional interest in the U.S., and was of such
                        importance domestically, that any assistance from Thailand would be greatly
                        welcomed.</p>
                    <p>On another point, over the long term he had heard interpretations of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to the effect that
                        we would withdraw from Asia. He had seen a great deal of the author of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, who did not have
                        any such impression.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> expressed concern
                        over the Supreme Court decision allowing the printing of secret papers. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> commented jokingly that
                        at a recent press reception in the State Department he had accused the
                        Soviet Ambassador of being present to complain over having to pay for what
                        the U.S. newspapers were getting free. The Supreme Court decision had not
                        been that the act was legal, only that if documents were stolen the
                        government recourse had to be through criminal prosecution and not through
                        an injunction.</p>
                    <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0327"/>
                    <p>Therefore the U.S. would need to proceed against the criminal, and not
                        against the newspapers. We would also adopt new procedures to restrict the
                        circulation of documents to a much greater extent and not embarrass other
                        governments. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>
                        declared that making confidential decisions public would put the Executive
                        in a difficult position because it set a precedent for the press in other
                        countries. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked
                        that there was no question but that this had been a very unfortunate
                        incident. However, it was not likely to be repeated because it had taken
                        place in a moment of hysteria.</p>

                            with Foreign Minister Thanat on Vietnam and Chinese

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> referred to the
                        just-completed discussions with Prime Minister Thanom and other senior Thai
                        leaders, and noted that many important matters had been covered. We would
                        want to continue to discuss the questions of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> defense support for Thailand and support for the Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>'s.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> went on to say that with
                        respect to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward China and the
                        Vietnam negotiations, we would try to keep the Thai fully informed so that
                        they could have complete confidence in what direction we were going, and
                        would not be confronted with any drastic surprises. We were not planning any
                        such surprises. Foreign Minister Thanat wondered if speedy contacts with the
                        Chinese might be <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0328"/>included among the
                        list of surprises, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        observed that he was talking more about developments connected with Vietnam.
                        The Thai had no doubt been surprised on one or two occasions over our troop
                        withdrawal decisions.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for his thoughts about
                        the Paris talks. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        replied that, speaking candidly, he did not expect much to happen over the
                        next two months. We couldn't be sure about the purpose of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRG1">PRG</gloss> proposal and would have to see how to
                        interpret it. It could have been designed either to exploit <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public opinion and increase pressure on us,
                        or to mark the beginning of real negotiations. There was a chance that the
                        North Vietnamese had decided to engage in serious negotiations because
                        pressures on them-selves and developments vis-à-vis the Soviets and the
                        Chinese made them believe that this was a good time to settle. On the other
                        hand, they could be waiting for next year's <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> elections. We simply didn't know. Their proposal contained
                        slightly more forthcoming language. It was consistent with what they had
                        said before, but also consistent with what they might say if they were
                        opening up. We would get word to the Foreign Minister about our
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked, would
                        the South Vietnamese make a counterproposal? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> replied that we and the South Vietnamese had not
                        decided how to handle the question of our response. This would depend to
                        some extent on the President's judgment following his, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s, return. He was going to Paris
                        to meet Ambassador Bruce—he would not see Mme. Binh, though—and would review
                        the situation with Bruce, but not do any negotiating. Perhaps we would make
                        a counterproposal, but within the framework of the President's October 7,
                        1970 position. We would not accept a cease-fire for us and none for our
                        allies, and could not stop economic and military aid to these allies while
                        the North Vietnamese received such assistance from the Chinese and the
                        Soviets. On the question of our withdrawals and the timing, we were
                        withdrawing anyway, but the December 31 date was unacceptable. We had not
                        set a deadline because we wanted to relate this issue to the
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> called
                        attention to the fact that all countries having troops in South Vietnam had
                        said that they would withdraw, but the other side hadn't said anything about
                        reducing its forces. This was a strong point for our side. Ambassador Unger
                        agreed that the other side was setting a double standard which could be
                        exploited. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that
                        we would review the situation. We had a problem with public opinion in that
                        many people didn't care what was fair—the radicals did not complain over the
                        North's invasion of the South, but would put up great cries of indignation
                        if the South threatened to invade the North. Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> surmised that this was because people
                        didn't want the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to become involved.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0329"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> not to expect anything
                        much in Paris. We would move very slowly, and spend the next two weeks
                        pointing out the negative aspects of the <gloss target="#t_PRG1">PRG</gloss>
                        proposal. At the time he had left Washington, we had no idea that this
                        proposal was forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> asked about the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> decision on the Chinese representation
                        issue in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed the view that it would
                        be made before the end of the month. Our problem was how to say something
                        constructive which would not infuriate both Chinas. We had discussed with
                        the Thai and others various formulae, such as a two-thirds vote for
                        expulsion and a simple majority for admission. Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s idea of voting on the expulsion
                        issue first before that of admission was intriguing, and he, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, would explore this when he
                        returned. There were of course a number of combinations, including sticking
                        to our present policies.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> suggested that
                        the two resolutions for requiring a two-thirds majority to expel Taiwan and
                        admit the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> by a simple majority might be
                        put forward at the same time, or within a few hours of one another. These
                        would be two separate resolutions, but expulsion would come first. He was
                        not sure, though, what the rule was if somebody wanted to alter the order.
                        Admittedly, it might be difficult to put one slightly ahead of the other.
                        This matter could be left to the “arm twisters.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he was
                        impressed by the Foreign Minister's concern. Would it be possible to vote by
                        paragraph (on the Albanian Resolution) in such a way that the expulsion
                        issue would never arise? Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName> thought that this could be done very easily.
                        Ambassador Unger thought that this procedure would need to be agreed upon by
                        a substantial majority. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName> said that even if the (Albanian) expulsion resolution
                        came first, we could ask for a two-thirds vote, which could be approved by a
                        simple majority.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated that the
                        President would make his decision before August 1, and it would probably be
                        some variation of these ideas. We would inform the Thai, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGS1">Newman</persName> would take this up with the Foreign
                        Minister. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                        declared that the Thai would go along with the President's decision.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered what the
                        Foreign Minister thought about sticking with the present formula? Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said he did not
                        believe this had any chance. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> asked if it still might not be possible to get a
                        majority for the Important Question? Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> said that he didn't know the answer
                        to this. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that
                        if we could get a majority for that, we could postpone the matter for
                        another year even if there was a bigger majority for the <pb n="281"
                            xml:id="pg_281" facs="0330"/>Albanian Resolution. Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> observed that this would
                        happen only if the people who wanted the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> relented. Ambassador Unger
                        interjected to say that if the people who wanted the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> in felt that it would be satisfactory to the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, then they might relent. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added that if these people
                        thought that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> wouldn't come unless
                        Taiwan were expelled, Taiwan would be expelled anyway and then we would have
                        paid a price. This would be the worst possible case. Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> mentioned that the strength
                        of those who were willing to have the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without pushing Taiwan out needed to
                        be established.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared it was his
                        instinct that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would move to some
                        position such as that which they had been discussing. There had been no
                        final decision as yet as to making expulsion a two-thirds vote. When this
                        decision was reached, we would make sure that the Thai were informed ahead
                        of time. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>
                        remarked that those who wanted the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in
                        were just about the same in number as those who wanted Taiwan in. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> concluded by saying
                        that was just about our own estimate.</p>

                            xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref>.</note>
                        concerning Pote Sarasin's approach to him for a repeat performance of the
                        1968–69 “Project Lotus.” We will have a chance to talk to Len directly about
                        this when he is in Washington for consultation next month, but I thought you
                        should be acquainted with the Washington view at this stage.</p>
                    <p>The matter was discussed at a 40 Committee meeting recently and Len's
                        position, as described in his letter, was unanimously supported. All of us
                        share his distaste for this kind of an operation. However, a suggestion was
                        made at the meeting that we have a look at the possibility <pb n="282"
                            xml:id="pg_282" facs="0331"/>of using this type of funding in some
                        manner in connection with our efforts to generate more effective <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> actions in the narcotics field. We do not
                        have any clear or specific ideas as to how this could be done. We would, of
                        course, not contemplate using such funds in lieu of assistance that might
                        more appropriately be provided for mutually agreed narcotics measures using
                        overt funds such as <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. More important, we
                        would want to avoid creating an impression on the Thai side that they could
                        expect or demand a “payoff” for actions they ought to be taking anyway or
                        for which we could influence them by more conventional and regular
                        approaches. Finally, we must avoid setting a precedent for periodic
                        under-the-table contributions to Thai political leaders for any purpose.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these reservations and with full acceptance of Len's
                        persuasive reasoning, we feel that the urgency and importance of the
                        narcotics problem in Thailand makes it incumbent upon us to keep our minds
                        open to any possible course of action, however un-orthodox, that might
                        advance our objectives. Please give the matter some thought and let me know
                        if you can see any possibilities.</p>

                    <p>To follow up my visit, I want to move as rapidly as possible to obtain an
                        acceptable force improvement package for consideration by the President. I
                        have found mission proposals transmitted to my staff in Saigon most
                        valuable. I would like to have Mission comments by <pb n="283"

                            He added that “the military activities and amount of assistance proposed
                            will be a fair test of Thai willingness to upgrade their forces to meet

                    <p>While the proposal outlined below continues to provide assistance for Thai

                            >RTARF</gloss> capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The concept is that this proposal should be viewed by the <gloss

                        the capabilities of its military forces. The second step would reflect
                        decisions in the context of <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 99 and the
                        performance of the Thai in meeting the conditions of the agreement proposed
                        for negotiation now.</p>
                    <p>The proposal includes an assistance package made up of two elements:</p>

                                >Newman</persName> welcomed the news that the 40 Committee supported

                                >Document 129</ref>) and informed <persName>Johnson</persName>, in

                            field for possibilities.” He recommended that intelligence be provided
                            Police Major General Chompon Lohachala so that the latter could go after
                            the drug traffickers. He stated that the Embassy planned to do this [<hi

                            test basis.” In his August 7 cover letter to

                                corresp="#p_NGS1">Newman</persName> stated that he [<hi

                            individuals.” However, he noted, due to “jurisdictional concerns and
                            departmental politics within the Thai National Police Department, we are
                            moving cautiously on this front.”</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGS1">Newman</persName> then recalled the conversation

                        that we follow up with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> to
                        explore the possibilities for utilizing the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                            >KMT</gloss> irregulars to help suppress the trafficking of opium from
                        the Shan States in Thailand.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> summarized the efforts in
                        which he has been engaged for the past year to re-settle <gloss
                            target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> irregulars in Thailand in areas where they
                        could cultivate crops and raise livestock as an income substitute for
                        trafficking in opium on condition that irregulars turn in their arms and
                        submit fully to <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> authority. Part of the
                        agreement of course involves first the clearance by the irregulars of areas
                        controlled <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0335"/>by the Communist
                        insurgents, and after security is established they are supposed to turn in
                        their arms to <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> controlled storehouses.
                        The <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is to provide tea tree seedlings and
                        farm equipment as well as some livestock and advice and assistance in animal
                        husbandry. <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> irregulars are also obliged
                        to get out of the opium business. When this agreement was negotiated in the
                        latter half of 1970, Generals Li and Tuan asked that the embargoes on <gloss
                            target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> engagement in the opium business be
                        deferred until after the 1971 crop had been disposed of. Li and Tuan pleaded
                        that they would need this additional income during the period of
                        re-establishment. Though <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>
                        never flatly so stated, it is clear that he felt obliged not to interfere
                        with the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> opium trafficking during the
                        past few months when this year's harvest was being moved. Newman cited facts
                        and figures, drawing on the attached brief,<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">Not
                            attached.</note> indicating that Generals Li and Tuan control the
                        movement of a significant amount of the opium crop in the Shan States to
                        Thailand and also engage in refining it in Chiang Mai Province. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> made notes on the most recent
                        shipments in June 1971 (see page 3 of attachment). <persName
                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> was impressed with our information
                        on the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> opium smuggling activities and
                        made no effort to dispute our information; in fact, he noted that it is
                        difficult for him to obtain reliable information of this kind and solicited
                        our assistance. I promised to give him a summary of our information on this
                        subject, if possible by next week. I cautioned him, and he agreed, that in
                        his use of this information there would be no reference to the fact that he
                        obtained it from the Americans. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> seemed to be particularly interested in getting
                        information on where the irregulars are operating their refineries.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> was quite candid in his
                        admission that he and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> cannot be
                        certain that Generals Li and Tuan will honor fully and sincerely their
                        commitments to the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> suggested that if they do not, the
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will be forced to consider
                        appropriate disciplinary action. He is trying very hard to provide enough
                        assistance so that the irregulars can re-settle with their families, earn an
                        adequate living, and exist as law-abiding Thai nationals.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NGS1">Newman</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than
                            1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] expressed admiration for
                        his program and his efforts and asked whether he thought the next step could
                        be taken, namely, the utilization of the better fighting elements of the
                        irregulars to disrupt and hopefully prevent the movement of opium to
                        refineries in Tatchileck, Laos and Thailand. We noted that it is not enough
                        to get the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> out of the opium business <pb
                            n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0336"/>since there are plenty of others
                        who will be happy to move in. A force will be needed to attack caravans
                        under the protection of Shan insurgents and Burmese self-defense forces and
                        hopefully destroy the opium before it reaches the refineries. In this
                        connection we asked <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> whether
                        the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> irregulars now in Burma would be
                        moving to Thailand to re-settle with the others already here. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> said that they are free to do so
                        until the end of this rainy season. If they reject the Thai offer, they will
                        presumably join the other bands in Burma if they can. In thinking about the
                        problem, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> also commented that
                        if <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> irregulars were sent into Burma on
                        opium-destroying missions it would be necessary to have a few Thais with
                        them to make certain that we are not double-crossed. He concluded by
                        agreeing to consider the matter further, after which he will be back in
                        touch with us. <persName corresp="#p_NGS1">Newman</persName> reiterated the
                        urgency of developing plans in the near future in order that effective
                        action can be taken against the next crop which will be planted this fall.

                    </p>
                    <p>At departure ceremony today for Princess Ubol, Prime Minister asked me to
                        express to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> his appreciation for
                        the proposal I had outlined to him yesterday. He again pointed out that in
                        many of the areas we wish to see increases in defense expenditures the Thai
                        Government had already budgeted significant <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290"
                            facs="0339"/>increases for 1972. I replied that we were aware of these
                        increases but believed that the additional 20 million dollars in baht that
                        we are proposing as their part of the package was fully justified in view of
                        the threat. As he aware from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>] briefing, the insurgency threat in the
                        northeast was increasing and becoming more sophisticated and difficult to
                        counter. We felt this was equally true in other regions. Consequently, we
                        were suggesting that there should be significant increase in level of
                        operations by the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> against the
                        insurgency. This could be accomplished by the additional 20 million dollars
                        in defense expenditures and the 15 million dollar <gloss target="#t_MASF1"
                            >MASF</gloss> add-on. The Prime Minister replied that he had asked
                        Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> to see what could be
                        done practically and that <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> would
                        be in touch with our side on the details. He added that in many ways what
                        was happening in northeast Thailand was reminiscent of South Viet-Nam 5–10
                        years ago and the Thai Government needs to move vigorously to prevent the
                        insurgency from taking hold here as had been the case in Vietnam.</p>

                    <p>Under the Long-Term Arrangement on Cotton Textiles (<gloss target="#t_LTA1"
                            >LTA</gloss>), textile exports to the U.S. are limited. Thailand, which
                        has just begun to produce cotton pajamas, was told by us on April 30, 1971
                        to limit exports to the U.S. to 17,000 dozen pajamas over the succeeding
                        twelve months and asked to consult with us. (This number was derived
                        according to a formula contained in the <gloss target="#t_LTA1"
                        >LTA</gloss>.) Subsequent to that time, however, the Thai speeded up
                        production and exported 31,000 dozen pajamas in the month of May alone.
                        Because of the apparent neglect by the Thai of our representations and the
                        large number of pajamas exported, Commerce, Labor and other agencies (except
                        State) argue that the Thai should not be permitted to import into the U.S.
                        an amount in addition to the 17,000 dozen prescribed by the <gloss

                        restraint agreement for subsequent exports—which the Thai do not wish to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>State's memorandum is, therefore, an attempt to bypass the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITAC1">ITAC</gloss>. Doing so not only raises bureaucratic
                        hackles but approval would mean our approving for Thailand imports of cotton
                        textiles greater than the <gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss> prescribed
                        level. Other exporters could be counted on to swiftly protest against this
                        action on the grounds that it is discriminating against them and request
                        increases in their own allotments. Also being a domestically sensitive
                        product, cotton textile imports in excess of previously prescribed levels
                        would incur serious domestic criticism. I have therefore asked that this
                        matter be considered formally by the <gloss target="#t_ITAC1">ITAC</gloss>
                        and that a memorandum containing the views of all concerned agencies be
                        submitted.</p>

                        review the present status of the program, I met yesterday with Prime

                            <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>, <persName

                        Boonchai (standing in for Surakij who is out of country). With me were

                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. I recalled the
                        Prime Minister's discussion of a 36 volunteer battalion force level with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> during the latter's
                        visit to Bangkok in July<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">See <ref target="#d127"
                                >Document 127</ref>.</note> and noted our understanding that Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> had recently
                        reiterated his request to the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> that it
                        undertake such an expansion of the program. I informed the Prime Minister
                        that we are prepared to support 36 battalions subject only to the necessary
                        legislative authorization of funds.</p>
                    <p>a. Having carefully reviewed since my return the slippage in the recruitment
                        and training of the already authorized 24 battalion force and the severe
                        losses by resignation, etc., among deployed battalions, I provided the Prime
                        Minister with a rather detailed summary of the status of the program as we
                        understand it. I explained to him that one of my purposes in doing so was to
                        determine whether it is realistic and feasible at this time to engage in
                        military and budgetary planning premised on the eventual availability of a
                        36 battalion force. My other purpose was to see that everything possible was
                        being done to assure <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0342"/>that we will
                        be in a strong position to meet the anticipated heavy enemy pressures in
                        Laos in the coming dry season.</p>
                    <p>3. I recalled that our mutually agreed schedule developed early in 1971
                        provided for 24 battalions to be deployed by the end of this calendar year.
                        The last of these units were to go into training in October. There are now
                        only 17 battalions in the field (actually the 17th will be deployed within
                        the next several days); none are in training although we have been advised
                        that two more battalions may start training later this month. If the
                        original schedule is to be maintained, five more battalions must commence
                        training before the end of October. This schedule, of course, was developed
                        to assure the maximum possible force to repel the enemy's effort in the
                        upcoming dry season campaign.</p>
                    <p>4. The situation with respect to the actual on-board strength of units
                        currently deployed is even more disturbing. The average onboard strength of
                        deployed battalions is only about 55 percent of the authorized strength;
                        approximately 7 percent are on authorized leave and expected to return; an
                        additional 6 percent have been lost to battle casualties. More than 30
                        percent of the volunteers have resigned from their units or have gone AWOL.
                        In sum, the units deployed in Laos are short more than 4,500 men. To replace
                        these losses and to commence the training of five battalions before the end
                        of October will require a drastic effort to meet what now appears to be a
                        shortfall numbering approximately 7,000 men.</p>
                    <p>5. In this connection I noted that at the beginning of the last dry season
                        campaign, before any of the irregular battalions were deployed, Thai forces
                        organized into three regular battalions plus the Thai artillery units
                        numbered about 3,000 men. Today the 8 volunteer infantry and two artillery
                            <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions available to General
                            <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> have a total strength of
                        only slightly more than 2,800 (today there are also other Thai forces in
                        Laos, of course). Considering the attrition that Vang Pao's forces have
                        suffered and the expected all-out effort on the part of the North Vietnamese
                        during the coming dry season, there is deep concern that the forces
                        available in <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss>2 will be woefully undermanned
                        unless dramatic action is taken soon.</p>
                    <p>6. I suggested that it is not realistic for either of us to think in concrete
                        terms of the formation and deployment of 36 battalions unless it is possible
                        before the end of October to obtain enough volunteers to commence the
                        training of the 24 battalions previously agreed to and in addition to
                        providing replacements in the deployed battalions in sufficient quantities
                        to bring these units up to at least 80 percent of their authorized strength
                        level.</p>
                    <p>7. At this point I took note of the Prime Minister's interest in developing a
                        bonus system for men who have completed their tour of duty in Laos as an
                        inducement to help with the recruiting program and <pb n="294"
                            xml:id="pg_294" facs="0343"/>to reduce the number of losses through
                        resignation and other absenteeism. Discussions between [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] Bangkok and
                        Vientiane on the one hand and the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> staff
                        and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] on the other have resulted in the development of a scheme
                        for a two part bonus system—one part to be paid to the volunteer for
                        completing his duty and the other to be paid after reenlistment for a second
                        tour. Though the funding of this proposal has not yet been completed, we are
                        attempting to obtain expeditious action.</p>
                    <p>8. It has been our understanding that the tour of duty for each volunteer was
                        15 months after training. Recently we were advised that <gloss
                            target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> headquarters has revised the tour length to
                        be one year after training. The effect of this is to shorten the tour of
                        duty by about 3 months. Since this might further exacerbate the recruitment
                        problem and add an additional training burden, I inquired whether this
                        decision to abbreviate the tour could be reconsidered.</p>
                    <p>9. Noting General Praphat's concern that an adequate medevac capability be
                        assured to handle the casualty problem during the next dry season campaign,
                        I advised the Prime Minister that action has been taken to assure the
                        availability of six helicopter gunships to escort medevac lift operations.
                        We are now awaiting the identification of Thai helicopter pilots so that we
                        can plan and institute as quickly as possible a training program. The
                        identification of these pilots must be accomplished if they are to be
                        gunship qualified by the time they are needed.</p>
                    <p>10. Finally, I called attention to the decision taken some time ago to man
                        the Korat Friendship Hospital with sufficient <gloss target="#t_RTA1"
                            >RTA</gloss> personnel to handle the major portion of Thai volunteer
                        casualties. According to our information, the staffing of this hospital is
                        going rather slowly and I requested that the problem be examined on the Thai
                        side to make certain that adequate preparation is being made to assure
                        proper medical support for the Thai volunteers.</p>
                    <p>11. In his response, the Prime Minister admitted that they had had a number
                        of problems with the Thai volunteer effort. Morale among the volunteers has
                        not been very good and one of the reasons for this is that the the men in
                        the program see no future for themselves. The pay has been low and the
                        fighting has been tough. The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for
                        the effort to get the bonus system approved. He feels this is essential to
                        help keep the men in their units and to give a boost to the recruitment
                        effort. For example, he noted that many of the volunteers from the Black
                        Panthers returning from Vietnam are interested in the volunteer program but
                        they are not attracted by the lower pay and loss of the other benefits which
                        they had been receiving, including their mustering out payment at the end of
                        their duty in Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0344"/>
                    <p>12. The Prime Minister praised the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> for
                        its efforts and said it is doing its best to recruit, but he expressed his
                        regret that it has been unable to maintain the recruitment schedule and
                        replace losses. He went on to say, with General Praphat nodding agreement,
                        that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> would redouble its efforts and
                        that it will have 24 battalions by the end of this calendar year. He needs
                        help from us in obtaining prompt approval of the bonus system, but with that
                        assistance, he feels certain that this target can be met. The Prime
                        Minister, again with General Praphat in agreement, concluded this part of
                        his comments by asking that we continue to plan and program for 12
                        additional battalions (36 battalion total) saying, “I guarantee we will do
                        it.” I inquired whether a further boost to recruitment and retention of the
                        program might be achieved by offering to those volunteers who perform
                        successfully an opportunity for a career in the <gloss target="#t_RTA1"
                            >RTA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> replied that
                        they have been working on this and have already announced the performance,
                        experience, and educational criteria for volunteers who wish to join the
                            <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss>. In order to open this opportunity
                        to more men, the educational requirement has been reduced from Matayom Hok
                        to Matayom See (equivalent respectively to 10th and 8th grades).</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said that the Supreme
                        Command is issuing an order to the various Thai services and will provide us
                        very shortly with the identity of the pilots for gunship training.</p>
                    <p>14. The Thais strongly resisted our request to reconsider the decision
                        already taken concerning the length of duty tours for volunteers. They noted
                        that the men are kept on the line with little relief or leave. As <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said, “We can't expect to keep them
                        in the foxholes longer than 12 months.” A move now to restore the 15 month
                        tour of duty after training would aggravate rather than help solve the
                        recruitment and training program. In view of their strong feelings, I did
                        not press this further, but pointed out that it made it even more essential
                        to pursue recruiting with real vigor.</p>
                    <p>15. Finally, concerning the medical treatment of casualties, Praphat assured
                        us that orders have gone to the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> Surgeon
                        General who is responsible for developing surgical and medical teams which
                        can move quickly to Korat or elsewhere as needed. The <gloss
                            target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> suffers from severe shortages in this field
                        and it cannot man the Korat Hospital beyond the level of current needs.
                        However, steps are being taken to identify and prepare the medical teams to
                        move rapidly when the situation requires.</p>
                    <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: The atmosphere throughout the session was
                        constructive and forward looking. Though my brief was implicitly critical of
                        the shortcomings of Thai performance, it was received without recrimination
                        and the spirit of the meeting evidenced Thai determination to solve their
                        problems and meet the 36 volunteer battalion goal. General Praphat did note
                        in passing at one point that in the early stages <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296"
                            facs="0345"/>of the program there had been some shortages in support on
                        the American side but he had no complaints concerning the current level of
                        support, and his comment was made in the context of the need for mutual
                        understanding of the problems that exist on both sides in an effort to make
                        this program succeed.</p>
                    <p>17. I do not think that we should expect any miraculous recovery of the
                        slippages which have already occurred. Unquestionably, however, Thai
                        leadership is impressed and grateful for our continued support of the
                        volunteer program and for our decision to expand it to the 36 battalion
                        level if funds become available. Their success in the course of the next six
                        to eight weeks in identifying and placing into training the remainder of the
                        previously authorized 24 battalions should provide a pretty good index of
                        their ability to reach the 36 battalion level in 1972. In the meantime, it
                        is quite essential that we authorize promptly the bonus system as developed
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>]. It is my understanding that this can be accomplished
                        within currently authorized program levels since it is quite clear that the
                        average number of volunteers deployed is unlikely to exceed 80 percent of
                        their authorized strength.</p>

                    <p>1. Attached herewith is a copy of a message from Bangkok, dated 14 September
                        1971, relating to a meeting held between Deputy Chief of Mission and [<hi

                        General <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak Chamanan</persName>, Deputy
                        Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command. The report referred to in this
                        message is TDCSDB–315/05276–71, a copy of which has been disseminated to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>2. While the account of the meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> is very interesting, we are highly skeptical that
                        the Chinese Irregular Forces, which have existed for many years primarily on
                        the revenue obtained from opium traffic, will give up this lucrative trade.
                        We note that under this plan, the 1971 opium crop would not be affected.
                        This cycle could be repeated for the 1972 crop for one reason or another.
                        There is also the good possibility, because of the current public concern
                        over the drug problem, of the American interest or hand surfacing. While we
                        have not yet examined what the repercussions of such event would have on
                        Burmese/U.S. relations, we must assume they would be adversely affected.
                        Additionally, such disclosure would only give credence to Burmese past and
                        present claims and charges of U.S. support and involvement with the Chinese
                        Irregulars.</p>

                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> to determine his progress in
                        resettling the Chinese Irregular Forces (<gloss target="#t_CIF1"
                        >CIF</gloss>) of Generals Li and Tuan and to press him to take appropriate

                        opium traffic. In early August, General <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> reported that he had a commitment from both
                        Generals Li and Tuan that their involvement in the opium traffic would cease
                        after the 1971 crop had been disposed of. Last week he reported that he had
                        reconfirmed this commitment with General Tuan which action is supported by
                        the reference report. General <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> stated that he was unable to see <pb n="298"

                    <p>3. In response to our query as to whether <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> had any thoughts on how the refineries in Tachilek
                        could be put out of business, <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> suggested that he attempt to persuade Li and Tuan
                        to undertake this task. He agreed to sound them out on this possibility at
                        the time of his next trip. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>
                        asked that we clear this informally with <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                            >Dawee</persName>; this was accomplished on 9 September. He noted that
                        there must be no leak to Li or Tuan concerning American interest or support
                        and we assured him that we are as interested as he in maintaining strict
                        security. Although we did not discuss the specifics of compensation to Li
                        and Tuan for a successful operation, <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> noted that he would wish to relate it to other
                        assistance he is providing for the resettlement of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>. In addition, it will be necessary to
                        promise death and disability benefits.</p>
                    <p>4. The foregoing may sound far fetched in view of the well earned reputation
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> for their heavy involvement in
                        opium trafficking over the years. We are in no position at this point to
                        provide a reliable assessment of <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName>'s chances. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                        reflected <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>'s efforts to bring
                        the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> under control and to regularize
                        their status in Thailand. Though <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> himself remains skeptical about their long term
                        intentions and motivation, he feels that he has made considerable progress
                        in bringing these forces under greater <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        control and that in the process of doing so, his leverage has increased.
                        Tuan and Li have been promised Thai citizenship and their forces will
                        receive permanent resident permits. In return for this and other assistance,
                        the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> has performed a useful role against
                        Communist insurgents. We believe that <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName>'s interest in using <gloss target="#t_CIF1"
                            >CIF</gloss> against the Tachilek refineries should be encouraged and,
                        if appropriate, assisted if this can be accomplished without any disclosure
                        of the hand of the United States Government. We recognize that if
                        successful, the effort will probably be required on a continuing and not
                        just a one-time basis. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>
                        appreciates this, too, but rightly wants to approach this cautiously,
                        avoiding long-term commitments pending step-by-step evaluation of the
                        results.</p>
                    <p>5. Messrs. Gross and Minnick have been briefed on this possibility and feel
                        we should pursue its feasibility. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text

                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>). The thrust of the briefing was to call
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> attention to the expanding covert
                        village infra-structure which the <gloss target="#t_CPT1">CPT</gloss> has
                        built in the Phuphan Mountain area in the northeast, particularly in the
                        Nakae District of Nakhon Phanom. Though our intelligence in the north is
                        less detailed than in the northeast, attention was also given to the growing
                        numbers of insurgents and more sophisticated weaponry in the north and the
                        expanded activity on the part of the <gloss target="#t_CPT1">CPT</gloss>
                        cadre working out of the high-land into lowland Thai villages.</p>
                    <p>3. After noting that since my return I had reviewed developments in the
                        insurgency situation during my absence, I commented on this rather
                        discouraging picture—discouraging to the extent that the situation in these
                        areas has continued to deteriorate during the past year. Recently, the
                            <gloss target="#t_CPT1">CPT</gloss> has been able to organize its covert
                        village infra-structure in the northeast to foment at least 8 demonstrations
                        against government officials—demonstrations clearly organized to press
                        Communist interests and not the normal needs of the villagers. At least in
                        this area, the Communists have the capability to manipulate public opinion
                        and stir up the villagers against the government's counterinsurgency
                        efforts. It is a dangerous new feature of the insurgency.</p>
                    <p>4. I observed that the progress which the <gloss target="#t_CPT1">CPT</gloss>
                        has made serves to highlight the need for a more intensive and aggressive
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> response. For one thing, greater
                        cooperation on the part of civil, military, and police forces is urgently
                        required. A number of instances were cited where differences among these
                        various elements had prevented or weakened an effective <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> response. In other cases, there have been
                        problems of <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0349"/>inadequate support and
                        attention from Bangkok resulting in district and province level positions
                        being left unfilled, delays in making budgeted funds for counterinsurgency
                        operations available, etc. a more concerted police effort is needed in some
                        of the most critical areas. Many military patrol, reconnaissance and
                        hunter-capture operations are effective while they last but are not run on a
                        sustained basis. This gives the insurgents an opportunity to regroup and
                        restore their access to the village population.</p>
                    <p>5. I emphasized that one of the reasons for the new <gloss target="#t_AAT1"
                            >AAT</gloss> program is to provide additional assistance to the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> to intensify their counterinsurgency
                        operations. We realize the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is making
                        every effort within its own budget to respond to this growing threat and we
                        hope that additional assistance provided in the <gloss target="#t_AAT1"
                            >AAT</gloss> proposal, by relieving budgetary pressure in other sectors,
                        will enable it to do more than it would otherwise be able to do within
                        present <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> budget limitations.</p>
                    <p>6. The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for the intelligence
                        exchanged and for our interest, advice, and support in the entire range of
                        counterinsurgency programs and operations. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> is trying, he said, to get the various elements of the
                        government working together more closely, and he cited as an example the
                        recent seminar of governors of the insurgency-infested provinces held in
                        Bangkok under <gloss target="#t_CSOC1">CSOC</gloss> sponsorship with
                        military, police, and dola participation. Every effort is being made to
                        increase the budget for counterinsurgency operations. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said that in 1970, 600 million baht
                        was allocated for these operations; 650 million in 1971; and for 1972,
                        despite the many cuts made elsewhere, over 800 million baht is budgeted for
                        counterinsurgency. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>
                        said that the military intends to run more operations such as Operation
                        Phalad in the north and that these will be prolonged, not so limited in time
                        as was Phalad. Apparently, the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> is now
                        planning such an operation in Petchabun for which funds are being sought
                        from lower priority requirements. Also, more intensive reconnaissance and
                        hunter-capture operations are planned for Nakhon Phanom.</p>
                    <p>7. I expressed my satisfaction and interest in this evidence of increased
                        activity and again asked that in their review of our <gloss target="#t_AAT1"
                            >AAT</gloss> program, they look for other opportunities for striking
                        hard against the Communists in ways that are not possible within their
                        present budget. The Prime Minister closed with a strong statement of
                        appreciation for the critically important assistance provided by the U.S.
                        Government, noting that the Thais cannot now handle the problem without
                        material aid from us. Praphat echoed this with a statement reflecting his
                        recognition that a more powerful thrust is needed against the internal
                        Communist threat.</p>

                        initiative, we met with him 27 October 1971 on further developments outlined
                        ref. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> stated that he met
                        earlier that day with <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> Generals Li and
                        Tuan. Generals told <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> that
                        their present raw opium stocks total 14,000 choi. After <persName
                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> determined size of stock, he
                        informed Generals that <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> considering
                        purchasing total stock on one-time basis for medicinal purposes. Price for
                        stocks to be determined by current market price. Generals Li and Tuan said
                        they would accept <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> offer, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> then ordered them not to move any
                        of these stocks without his personal approval. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> emphasized to Li and Tuan that <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> purchase, if approved, would be a one-time
                        buy and no more. Further, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>
                        added, he extracted commitment from Li and Tuan that they will not engage in
                        opium traffic in future.</p>
                    <p>2. At current market of about 1,200 per choi, preemptive buying of total
                        stock would be close to USD one million. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> asked that we consult with appropriate <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> authorities seeking approval for this
                        preemptive purchase. We reminded <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> that per previous statements [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] this proposal
                        had already been forwarded to Washington for consideration. We added that as
                        of now, however, policy decision had not been communicated to mission in
                        Bangkok.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> commented that he starting
                        to resettle <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> personnel and dependents in

                        locations in Fang district along Thai-Burma border. It appears clear that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> strapped for funds in
                        his resettlement program and that preemptive buying of opium stocks will

                    <p>Conto 24/14775. Subject: Connally Visit; East Asia—Secretary Connally's Calls
                        on Minister of Finance Serm and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Summary: Secretary Connally affirmed that the United States will honor its
                        commitments to countries of <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia and that
                        U.S. military presence as well as economic assistance will continue while a
                        need exists. Secretary Connally also assured the Thai that the President's
                        visit to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would not jeopardize the
                        interests of Thailand or other third countries. The major concern of Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> was China and the
                        threat posed to Thai security. He urged the U.S. to maintain a strong
                        position in <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia while trying to improve
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> called first on
                        Minister of Finance Serm Vinicchayakul. After initial pleasantries,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> asked for Serm's
                        comments on the U.S. economic program. Serm said he understood the factors
                        which prompted the U.S. to take this action. The fact that the dollar was
                        not devalued, Serm felt, was important to countries such as Thailand with
                        substantial dollar reserves. Secretary Connally assured Serm that the U.S.
                        program took interests of developing nations into account. The
                        administration believed that objectives of the program would be mutually
                        beneficial to U.S. and developing countries. The U.S. looks to Southeast
                        Asia as vital participants in world trade, suppliers of essential raw
                        materials, and important trading partners. U.S. interest in this area will
                        continue, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                        said.</p>
                    <p>2. At the conclusion of the meeting, Serm escorted Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> and the Ambassador to a meeting
                        with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom
                            Kittikachorn</persName>. Other persons present for the meeting were
                        Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote Sarasin</persName>,
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat Khoman</persName>, Lt.

                    <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> opened with a
                        forceful declaration of U.S. commitment to Thailand and other countries of
                            <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, he said, had asked him to affirm
                        that the U.S. will maintain its military and economic presence in <gloss

                            xml:id="pg_303" facs="0352"/>In accordance with the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, Thailand can be assured of
                        continued U.S. assistance to help meet its economic and military needs.
                        Despite the recent defeat of the Foreign Assistance Bill by the U.S. Senate,
                        the administration is vigorously seeking interim means of continuing
                        assistance until the question can be favorably resolved.</p>
                    <p>4. In response, <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> (speaking in
                        Thai with Thanat interpreting his remarks) thanked the Secretary for the
                        assurances which he brought from the President. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> said that U.S. military forces and assistance must
                        play a vital role not only in Vietnamization but also “Southeast
                        Asianization” to assure the future security of the region. He pointed out
                        that Thailand had cooperated closely with the United States in realization
                        of mutual objectives and that Thailand was fostering <gloss target="#t_SE1"
                            >SE</gloss> Asian unity by participating in regional programs.</p>
                    <p>5. Turning to the question of China, <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> said that Thailand, like the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>, believed that the time was ripe for the People's Republic
                        of China to become a member of the United Nations, and had supported the
                        U.S. position at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> expressed his appreciation for
                        Thai support. The U.S. realized that the question of admitting the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        was of vital importance to countries “only a stone's throw from mainland
                        China.”</p>
                    <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said that the
                        purpose of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit to
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was to seek an improved relationship
                        with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. He emphasized that the U.S.
                        had modest expectations for the results of the meeting. The President, he
                        said, feels a responsibility to try to bring the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> into the community of nations in a peaceful fashion.
                        However, the U.S. would not cultivate new friends at the expense of old. The
                        issues discussed at the meeting in China would be bilateral problems between
                        the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>; third countries need
                        not fear that their interests would be jeopardized.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that the China question
                        was, of course, of great concern to Thailand. He urged the U.S. to maintain
                        its “military/ economic/political umbrella” over <gloss target="#t_SE1"
                            >SE</gloss> Asia at the same time that it tried to improve relations
                        with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Diminished U.S. interest in
                            <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia could result in a power vacuum
                        which Peking might try to fill. He mentioned the Chinese road building
                        program in Laos and Burma and ex-pressed apprehension about the ultimate
                        purpose of these roads. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                            >Connally</persName>, in response, restated that the U.S. would continue
                        to maintain its strong posture in <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia
                        while the need existed.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: The major concern of the Thai was the
                        question of Communist China. Secretary Connally effectively outlined the
                        objectives of the President's visit to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss>, hopefully allaying Thai fears that the visit might be
                        injurious to their interests. Secretary Connally also took the initiative in
                        explaining that the administration is working <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304"

                        Assistance Bill by the Senate. The Thai did not question his assessment of
                        the problem or his assurance that it would be resolved.</p>

                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, October 29, stated that the
                            embargo of the 50,000 dozen pair of cotton nightwear “is now damaging
                            our overall relationship with Thailand.” It stated the Department's
                            belief that “the political realities of the present situation require
                            immediate release of the nightwear in exchange for a Thai promise to
                            negotiate.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59,

                                target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note> The grounds for this
                        recommendation after acknowledgement by State that the Thai Government has
                        handled the matter badly, are that “a political decision (is necessary)
                        permitting the entry of the embargoed goods, not further consideration of
                        the problem as a purely textile matter …”</p>
                    <p>This is probably the worst possible time for the Administration to make
                        textile import decisions on policy grounds such as these. We have just
                        concluded four understandings on wool and man-made fiber textiles with our
                        principal Asian suppliers. These understandings need to be converted into
                        agreements, notes exchanged, and the agreements implemented. The President
                        has reaffirmed to the domestic textile industry that he intends to implement
                        these agreements effectively to <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0354"
                        />hold imports from these countries within the terms of the agreements. This
                        means that we will need to implement these agreements in purely textile
                        terms. If we allow policy considerations such as those suggested by State to
                        intervene, the Administration will lose the confidence of the industry and
                        call into question our intentions with regard to the implementation of the
                        new Asian agreements.</p>
                    <p>The Thai Government has indeed handled the matter badly.</p>
                    <p>1. It neglected to advise its industry that the U.S. had invoked the
                        provisions of the Long Term Cotton Textile Arrangement (<gloss
                            target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>2. It permitted shipments to continue without control during the 60-day
                        period provided for consultations so that significantly more than the
                        restraint level specified in our April 29 note to the Thai Government was
                        shipped subsequent to the receipt of our note.</p>
                    <p>3. It did not avail itself of the opportunity to consult until the last day
                        of the 60-day period specified for consultations in the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Its official representative assured us that further shipments would cease
                        as of August 1, but our records show that shipments continued into
                        September. (October data are not yet available.)</p>
                    <p>The State Department has not handled the matter well either.</p>
                    <p>1. In January 1971 Embassy Bangkok was requested in a State Department
                        message cleared by the Interagency Textile Administrative Committee to alert
                        the Thai Government about the possibility of action under the <gloss
                            target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss> on the items now in dispute. The Embassy
                        chose not to do so.</p>
                    <p>2. In August 1971 when the Thais came to Washington to consult on this
                        matter, Commerce proposed that we suggest to the Thais the negotiation of a
                        bilateral agreement together with the outline of arrangement and the dates
                        for such a negotiation. State did not concur.</p>
                    <p>3. In September 1971, Commerce proposed that one of its senior officials
                        could undertake such a negotiation while he was in Hong Kong the last week
                        of that month. State did not concur.</p>
                    <p>4. In October 1971, Commerce proposed that we ask the Thai Government to
                        enter into a memorandum of understanding—just as was done with the four
                        major Asian suppliers of wool and man-mades— that would contain the key
                        points of a bilateral agreement. We offered to release the embargoed goods
                        immediately thereafter when the Thai delegation came to Washington to
                        negotiate an agreement and before an agreement was negotiated. State did not
                        concur.</p>
                    <p>Despite my clear negative reactions to the State Department memorandum and
                        the difficulty I have in seeing how the embargoed pajamas can be such ad
                        adverse factor in our relations with the Thai Government, we have proposed
                        another approach to resolve this problem which has been accepted by State,
                        Treasury, Agriculture, Labor, and STR. It involves releasing a portion of
                        the embargoed goods if the Thai Government will agree to begin the
                        negotiation of a bilateral agreement on a date certain in the near future
                        and, if no agreement is reached, <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0355"
                        />the quantity so released will be charged against the level for the second
                        year the restraints are in effect. The amount of goods to be released is
                        equal to the second year's restraint level. State is proceeding to
                        communicate with the Thai Government along these lines.</p>

                    <p>Johto 2/15421. From Ambassador. Subj: Under Secretary Johnson's Audience with
                        His Majesty the King.</p>
                    <p>1. This morning Undersecretary <persName>Johnson</persName>, accompanied by
                        myself and <persName corresp="#p_GJI1">John Getz</persName>, was received in
                        audience by His Majesty the King. The discussion ranged widely over various
                        aspects of the current situation in Thailand, particularly in the field of
                        economic development, noting forward progress particularly in the northeast
                        since the period when the Under Secretary was Ambassador here.</p>
                    <p>2. Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> then expressed concern about
                        the worldwide narcotics problem and noted with satisfaction the progress
                        that was being made toward the development of a Thai/U.S. program in this
                        field. He referred specifically to my appointment with General Prasert
                        earlier this morning. The Under Secretary then mentioned the problem of
                        finding an economic alternative to opium production for the hill tribes in
                        northern Thailand and said that he understood His Majesty was sponsoring
                        some useful work in this field.</p>
                    <p>3. The King responded readily and talked at length about the experimentation
                        going on with a number of crops (for example, peaches, soy beans,
                        vegetables, and coffee). He explained the need for proceeding carefully,
                        “unofficially,” and sometimes at greater cost to be sure that the hill
                        tribesmen would be won over and would become willing participants. He
                        discussed the importance of being sure there was a market (His Majesty
                        advocated cooperatively organized rather than commercial canning industries)
                        and the need for transport to market. Not unexpectedly, this led His Majesty
                        to emphasize the heavy requirement for aircraft, particularly helicopters
                        and stol planes.</p>

                    <p>15497. 1. Tonight at 2010 I met at his request with Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>. With him were Deputy Prime Ministers
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal
                            Dawee</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName>. Prime Minister informed me that since 1900 hours
                        there had been effected a coup d'état carried out entirely under his
                        control. Thanom said that this has been done for the sake of the security of
                        Thailand “both externally and internally” as an alternative to letting
                        things go to ruin in the country because of inaction. The decision had been
                        taken to move rapidly and stop an unacceptable deterioration.</p>
                    <p>2. The Prime Minister, with contributions from others present, then described
                        the deplorable situation that has grown up because of the actions of the
                        members of Parliament since the inauguration of the Parliament in 1969. They
                        cited difficulties with Parliaments in earlier Thai history but said the
                        problems had never been so acute as in this case. In particular, the
                        Parliament has interfered in a totally unacceptable way in the
                        administration of the country and obstructed essential actions in many
                        fields. Furthermore, collectively and individually Parliament and its
                        members have attacked the government for its <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308"
                            facs="0357"/>performance and also made many personal attacks and have
                        spread among the people a growing lack of confidence in the government.
                        There have been serious budgetary delays this year as in previous years so
                        that money for the country's development is available only six months out of
                        each year; members of Parliament are obstructing appropriation of funds for
                        essential government purposes including national security and want money to
                        be diverted instead to funds which would be spent in their districts for
                        pork barrel purposes. The National Economic Development Board's five year
                        plan is held up because of parliamentary inaction and there was specific
                        reference made to World Bank President <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName>'s statement that economic development in Thailand
                        in the sixties was more rapid than it is today. The government is unable to
                        take advantage of World Bank loans because the Parliament refuses to enact
                        the necessary legislation.</p>
                    <p>3. The Prime Minister and General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName> both referred to activities of members of Parliament
                        with labor groups, students and others whom they were seeking to turn
                        against the government. For their own purposes they were stirring up
                        discontent and unrest and misunderstanding in complete disregard of the
                        stability of the government and the country. According to Pote there was a
                        concentrated move to stir up students to seek to take the universities away
                        from the government and run them independently and to take advantage of
                        student immaturity to turn them into instruments against the government.</p>
                    <p>4. Reference as then made to a certain number of members of Parliament who
                        had Communist leanings, were very happy to have the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and were insisting
                        that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> rush into establishing
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> immediately without
                        giving any consideration to the dangers that could ensue. Praphat clearly
                        attached special importance to this issue, commenting on the dangers of
                        certain Chinese-born who were not Thai in spite of having been born here.
                        The Communists were now trying to install in such people a feeling of the
                        greatness of the new China. Pote also emphasized this point, saying that
                        there is considerable recent evidence of Chinese in Thailand be-coming
                        hostile to the Thai—although the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is certainly not the
                        cause of the problem it has complicated it.</p>
                    <p>5. Marshal Thanom added the degenerating situation as far as public safety
                        was concerned and the rapid increase in crime. Actions being taken now would
                        make it possible to move much more effectively against criminals and make it
                        possible to restore law and order. I said that I was aware of the conditions
                        they were describing but was surprised that they found them so critical as
                        to oblige them to take this action. After the several present again reviewed
                        the budgetary and other problems they had mentioned before, Marshal Thanom
                        concluded that discussion with his insistence that the action was taken out
                        of no motivation except for the security and well-being of the country.</p>
                    <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0358"/>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> went on to say that the
                        principal well-established Thai institutions and laws will continue to be
                        observed and above all, the institution of the monarchy. When I asked if His
                        Majesty had been informed of the action they said that Marshal Thanom had
                        just sent him a letter explaining their actions. They did not feel it right
                        to seek in any way to involve the King in their action and if they turned
                        out to be wrong, it was on their head. Marshal Thanom went on to state that
                        Thailand will uphold all its treaty obligations and that their action should
                        have no effect on relations with friendly countries. They said that I was
                        the only Ambassador they were calling in to inform personally and they hoped
                        in particular that there would be no change in Thailand's relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. (Reference was made to our recent
                        active discussions, presumably on narcotics and <gloss target="#t_AAT1"
                            >AAT</gloss>.) They insisted that their action was entirely an internal
                        one and need have no effects or repercussions outside. (They also asked me
                        not to mention my meeting with them since no other foreign representative
                        was being called in.) General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName> asked me whether I thought there should be some
                        change in their foreign policy. I first told them that was for them to
                        decide, not for me. I then said that we were generally happy with the
                        foreign policy of the Thai Govt as it has been conducted over many years,
                        particularly the close cooperative relations we have enjoyed. We also
                        realized that in times of change like the present, it made good sense for
                        the Thai Govt to be broadening its relations with other countries outside
                        the circle of its close friends and particularly concentrating on
                        strengthening its ties with its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>7. Since the group appeared to have completed their explanations for the
                        actions taken, I then told them very frankly that I was sure their actions
                        would be greeted around the world with considerable strong criticism. I said
                        that also in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> they must anticipate
                        expressions of disappointment at least, and in the press and probably in the
                        Congress some sharply adverse comment about returning to dictatorship, etc.
                        Marshal Thanom acknowledged this but said that their decision had been that
                        regardless, for the good of Thailand they must proceed. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> expressed the fear that without
                        strong direction there was danger that Thailand might go the way of Vietnam.
                        Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that while they
                        respected the principles of democracy and had attempted to put them into
                        action, it was clear that in Thailand today democracy doesn't work.</p>
                    <p>8. I acknowledged their comments but asked whether they did not feel that
                        dissolving of the Parliament and their other actions might not in fact make
                        more trouble for them internally with the Chinese groups, students and
                        insurgents. They insisted that groups like the students, farmers and
                        laborers would under normal circumstances be well behaved and support the
                        government but they were now being instigated by those individuals,
                        including members of Parliament, who <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0359"
                        />were stirring up opposition to the government for their own benefit. Under
                        the revolutionary group it was anticipated that the government could deal
                        more effectively with agitation and subversive activities. They anticipated
                        that there would be a rather prompt return to an orderly situation and one
                        that would be generally acceptable to the people. I said I hoped that this
                        would be the end result and that they did not find that they had created
                        more trouble for themselves by their action.</p>
                    <p>9. I then asked what would be their next steps. The Prime Minister said that
                        he could not say what would follow but it was explained that for the time
                        being, with the Cabinet having been dissolved, there would be a caretaker
                        arrangement, ministries would operate under their Under Secretaries and
                        policy questions would be referred to the head of the revolutionary group,
                        Marshal Thanom. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> himself said
                        that he anticipated that in about two to three months a regular government
                        with a cabinet would again be formed. In reply to my question they confirmed
                        that various of the revolutionary party orders which were first put into
                        effect in 1958 would again be enforced, including Article 17, having to do
                        with security.</p>
                    <p>10. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> returned to the
                        public relations problem, recognizing that the revolutionary group's
                        purposes and reasons for its action must be effectively explained abroad. We
                        talked about the possibility, as a longer run matter, of the Thai securing
                        professional advice in this field. Somewhat later I returned to this point
                        with Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> and emphasized the
                        importance of the purposes and their reasons for taking this drastic action
                        being fully and effectively explained. At this time I also mentioned that it
                        would be important if they could make clear their intention of returning to
                        constitutional government at some point.</p>
                    <p>11. This entire discussion was carried on in a friendly, almost relaxed
                        atmosphere, the Thai present appearing calm and confident of the rightness
                        of their action. I, of course, committed myself to reporting in full
                        everything they told me so that my government would be aware of their
                        reasons for action. While I made clear that I realized they were alone in a
                        position to make decisions about Thailand's Government, it was my judgment
                        that they must anticipate encountering considerable criticism abroad. As for
                        the consequences at home in Thai-land, I expressed my personal doubts but
                        acknowledged they were obviously the best judges.</p>
                    <p>12. I learned later that Marshal Thanom, <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> and General Prasert
                        (Director General TNPD) went to explain in person to His Majesty the King
                        the actions they had taken. According to <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                            >Dawee</persName> the King listened sympathetically and wished them
                        well.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Ambassador Unger has telephoned to State (Assistant Secretary Green)<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">No record of this telephone conversation has been
                            found.</note> a report of his meeting with the leaders of the coup in
                        Thailand. This report provides significant details of the reasons for the
                        coup and on the make-up of the new leadership structures, as follows:</p>
                    <p>—The leadership group consists of Field Marshal Thanom (now known as “Head of
                        the Revolutionary Council” rather than Prime Minister), General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote
                            Sarasin</persName>, and Air Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                            >Dawee</persName>. These say that there are no differences among them.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> will be in charge of the
                        Revolutionary Council for an undetermined period, and the country will be
                        under martial law.</p>
                    <p>—The coup was undertaken in order to dismiss the Parliament and suspend the
                        Constitution. This was done in response to what was described to Unger as a
                        “deteriorating situation” in the country caused by the failure of the
                        Parliament to measure up to legislative requirements such as the budget and
                        other badly-needed pieces of legislation. Moreover, some members of the
                        Parliament were undermining the Government by working with groups in the
                        country seeking to broaden instability.</p>
                    <p>—One of the failures of the Parliament had been to impose restrictions on the
                        terms offered for a World Bank loan, which made acceptance of this loan
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>—No foreign policy issues were involved in the coup, and there will be no
                        change in Thai foreign policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">The President
                            underlined this sentence and wrote: “<gloss target="#t_K1"
                            >K</gloss>—This is what matters.”</note> The coup leaders are hopeful
                        that cordial relations with the U.S. will continue. When Unger pointed out
                        that a critical reaction in the U.S. and around the world might be expected
                        over this lapse from democracy, the leaders said that they had anticipated a
                        reaction of this kind, but felt their move was necessary on the grounds of
                        internal security and in order to assure decisive action with respect to
                        internal development. (Unger suggested <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312"
                            facs="0361"/>that as a public line we should express disappointment that
                        the Thai effort to reestablish representative government had run into
                        difficulties, note however that these are difficult times, and then hope for
                        an early restoration of constitutional government.)</p>
                    <p>—There is now no Cabinet. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, in
                        meeting with a foreign correspondents group, called himself “Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>.” Unger thought that this might be
                        temporary, and is reserving his judgment on <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName>'s position.</p>
                    <p>—The King has been informed, but it is too early for his attitude to be made
                        known. The Revolutionary group is taking full responsibility for the coup,
                        making it plain that the King is not involved.</p>
                    <p>—It is also too early to know the reaction of the public and the press. Unger
                        feels that there will be a mixed reaction, but that people will be cautious
                        in commenting. There is no evidence of public unrest.</p>
                    <p>—Unger is the only foreign ambassador who has been called in to meet the new
                        leadership and this fact has not been publicly made known.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>As indicated by Ambassador Unger, there should be no change in Thai relations
                        with the U.S. The leaders of the Revolutionary Council are in fact
                        essentially the same ones with whom we have been dealing all along, and we
                        can anticipate that our programs in Thailand will continue without
                        interruption. One possible leadership casualty, how-ever, is <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, whose moves to make contacts with
                        Peking have drawn some criticism from more conservative leaders such as
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> also had reservations about
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>'s proposal to favor an
                        endorsement of neutrality for Southeast Asia at an <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss> meeting scheduled for November 25 at Kuala Lumpur.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> may in fact turn out to be
                        the new strong-man, since the coup could not have been undertaken without
                        the military forces which he commands. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> was planning to step down as Prime Minister in 1972
                        and <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> was considered likely to
                        replace him; the new situation may thus have simply moved up <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>'s succession to power even though
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> may remain as titular head
                        of the Revolutionary Council for some time.</p>
                    <p>I believe that we should be very cautious about commenting on the coup along
                        the lines suggested by Ambassador Unger. There will be criticism enough on
                        the Hill and in the media—with resulting pressure on legislation—without the
                        Government adding to the uproar. Press guidance so far has been to say “no
                        comment.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote Sarasin</persName> first came in alone to
                        talk to the Under Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said that
                        there was no coup but simply a change. He said that doing business through
                        the Parliament had become “in fact impossible,” and they felt there was no
                        other way but to change the structure of the government.</p>
                    <p>He spoke of three things that he believed were most important in bringing
                        about the decision to change the government. First was that the economic
                        plan would be impossible to implement under the existing system. (Parliament
                        obstructed international loan policy by refusing to make their funds
                        available). Second, problems within the government party itself could not be
                        resolved. Third, there was the problem of the Chinese in Thailand and the
                        possibility of subversion of the Chinese community.</p>
                    <p>In response to Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>'s question, <persName
                            corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said there would be no problem of
                        political prisoners as in the Sarit days, although he had earlier spoken of
                        stern measures to be taken against any opposition. He said, “the people were
                        dissatisfied and something had to be done.” He hopes that the new government
                        will be decisive. His greatest fear is not that <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> will be too harsh but that he will not be firm enough
                        and then the change will be for naught.</p>
                    <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0363"/>
                    <p>The meeting then shifted to the main conference room where the Thai side
                        comprised Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>, Air Marshal
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> opened the conversation by
                        saying that he had been to Laos yesterday and had visited Long Tieng and the
                        Plain of Jars and a battery of Thai volunteers. He said the Thai were doing
                        a good job.</p>
                    <p>Pote asked about the Cambodian situation. Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> said that on the whole he felt that
                        Cambodia in the last 18 months had done very well. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> expressed concern about the morale
                        of <gloss target="#t_FANK1">FANK</gloss> and commented that the Cambodians
                        changed leaders or commanders too often. Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> said that at the top there had been little
                        change and that Lon Nol's health continued to improve; he was impressed by
                        their strong sense of nationalism. Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> said that last night he had invited the Ambassador
                        and Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> to meet with him.
                        Regrettably the Under Secretary was not available but the Field Marshal
                        assumed that the Ambassador had briefed Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>. He
                        said the Revolutionary Group had had a note sent to all Embassies explaining
                        the reasons for the takeover. He said there was no change in Thai foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> said it was naturally up to the
                        Thai Government to decide what must be done, but they should be aware that
                        their action will have unfortunate effects abroad, especially in the United
                        States. He expressed particular concern about its effect on the debate on
                        economic and military assistance at this particularly critical time.</p>
                    <p>Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that one of
                        the reasons they under-took the change of government was that they felt they
                        could then more effectively proceed with programs the U.S. has advocated,
                        such as providing the counterpart funds necessary to <gloss target="#t_AAT1"
                            >AAT</gloss>. The government had set aside this money, but the Assembly
                        would not have agreed to its being spent for defense. He agreed that this
                        should not be cited in public as a reason.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> referred to the strong
                        opposition in the U.S. Senate to the foreign aid bill and to assistance to
                        Thailand in particular. This latest move will strengthen the hand of
                        opponents of such assistance and the immediate question is what can be done
                        to reduce the damage to the Thai program. He said that realistically the
                        Thai must anticipate some reduction in U.S. aid in any case. He expressed
                        the fear that riders will now be attached to the bill aimed specifically at
                        the Thai program. He made clear that the Administration did not want this
                        but it could well happen.</p>

                    <p>Reiterating that the Thai must make their own decisions, the Under Secretary
                        ventured certain suggestions. First, he said that the phrase coup d'état
                        creates an extremely bad impression and brings to mind soldiers shooting up
                        the government and this obviously is not what had happened. But the phrase
                        had been used and would be picked up by the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, and <hi
                            rend="italic">Washington Star</hi>. He emphasized the press aspect in
                        the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that there
                        were not only military but also civilian leaders in the new government and
                        he hoped that the foreign press would pick up the local press coverage.
                        Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that the local
                        English-language <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> headlines had been “coup
                        d'état” and that was what would be picked up in the foreign press.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary then said that a statement as soon as possible to the
                        effect that the intention of the group is to return to a constitutional
                        government would help. If it contained dates as to when this would be done,
                        that would be even better. Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> said they were considering what type of constitution
                        would be suitable for a permanent constitution for Thailand. Pote said that
                        they would make a public announcement regarding the constitution, but he did
                        not know when this would be done.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> said that the change will be
                        made that a military dictatorship has taken over, with all the bad
                        connotation that has in the United States, recalling events in Greece and
                        Brazil.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that the people
                        of the United States do not understand what “military dictatorship” means in
                        Thailand, and that we think of it in terms of Latin American governments. He
                        said the Americans in Thailand should help to make it clearer to Americans
                        in the U.S. that what is called “military dictatorship” here is greatly
                        different from the Latin American type. The Prime Minister said that the
                        Thai preserve the institution of the Crown, for example, and do not attempt
                        to set themselves up as Chiefs of State. He said the leadership after
                        announcing their takeover met with the King, and the King gave his blessing
                        to the change.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said that perhaps the
                        Thai should invite newspaper men and politicians to Thailand to see for
                        themselves what the situation is like. Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> said that would be helpful in the longer
                        run but the immediate problem was what statements were to be made.</p>
                    <p>Air Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said that they had
                        to terminate the power of the <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>'s, that
                            <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>'s were promoting student riots and
                        inciting labor and others, which led to the present situation. If nothing
                        were done, the situation would become so bad that even if the U.S. gave a
                        billion dollars in aid to Thailand there would be no country left to
                        defend.</p>
                    <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0365"/>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said talking about executive-legislative relations would
                        not help much in the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said
                        that the press and Congress will always interpret things the way they <hi
                            rend="italic">want</hi> to and that Fulbright and Mansfield will never
                        be won over. Most important to Thailand is what the leadership does in the
                        months to come to bring about stability, security, and to assure the
                        people's welfare. If the people are satisfied, this will vindicate the
                        action. He said they know the problems caused by their action and know that
                        they must live with these problems.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> agreed that what the leaders did
                        would be important but said again that his immediate worry is the short
                        term. He himself must go before Congress soon to defend the aid program for
                        Thailand. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> asked the Under
                        Secretary to help explain to Congress and the people in the U.S. that the
                        situation in Thailand is different from that in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> said that the
                        immediate problem to be addressed now is that certain things must be said
                        regarding the change and that it is important that they be said in the right
                        way. He suggested that it should be emphasized that this was not a bloody
                        coup but a peaceful takeover by the same men who led the previous
                        government, and that they are looking to the day when they can return to
                        constitutional processes.</p>
                    <p>Air Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> said the leaders
                        will not keep power forever and that they also want to work toward
                        democracy. He said that the Under Secretary could explain that he saw
                        himself the takeover was quiet and there was no bloodshed.</p>
                    <p>Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that he
                        believed actions in the next few weeks and months were more important than
                        statements that could be made now. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName> said there was no reason why the leadership could not
                        do both. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said they would do that.
                        They would have to consider what could be said. They were not saying “no” to
                        the suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> returned to the comment
                        concerning those such as Fulbright who would always be opposed to assistance
                        to Thailand. He said he was really concerned about the middle group that
                        would be prepared to shift depending on how this matter was handled in the
                        next few days.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that it was fortunate that
                        Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> was here at this time and could
                        explain what had happened and say there was no bloodshed. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> observed that children went to school
                        as usual, and there were the usual traffic jams and most everything was
                        proceeding as if nothing happened. <persName corresp="#p_PS5"
                            >Pote</persName> also said that Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> could help Thailand by stating that things
                        were normal; he had confidence that <persName>Johnson</persName>'s words had
                        great weight. The Under <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0366"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> said all U.S. official
                        statements will lack in persuasiveness.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> said that when the coup of 1958
                        occurred, Thailand was not in the public focus, but because of what has
                        happened in Southeast Asia in the intervening years Thailand was much more
                        in the news and that people in the U.S. were more interested in Thai
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary made the additional suggestion that it would be helpful
                        if the Thai would emphasize the civilian and non-military aspects of the
                        government. The press will seize on the fact that General Prasert is to be
                        the administrator for the civilian side. People will not notice that Prasert
                        is now Police Director General but only that he is a General. Field Marshal
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said that civilian Under
                        Secretaries are not acting in place of ministers in all except the Ministry
                        of Defense.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> said that to an American having
                        a Parliament is good and abolishing Parliament is bad, that nothing can
                        really change this attitude. However, the way the press is handled can help,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> cannot afford to ignore press
                        relations, or expect the Americans to do the job for them. He suggested that
                        the Thai, if they have not already done so, should consider hiring a
                        full-time public relations man, a Thai, to handle press relations for them.
                        Pote then said to the Under Secretary, “You find such a public relations man
                        for us and we will hire him.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName> said that in the U.S. we usually use newsmen or those
                        familiar with and acceptable to the working press to deal with this type of
                        thing. Pote asked who there is in Thailand who can do this for the group.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> answered that the
                        Americans can't name anyone but that he should look for someone, perhaps
                        working in the English-language press, who has good foreign connections as
                        well as being effective in Thailand. Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> said that they should have a first-class
                        press man in the Prime Minister's office and who would be responsible for
                        all statements issued by the Revolutionary Group.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked whether the Thai leaders ever held press
                        conferences. Pote said formerly the Prime Minister and he had weekly press
                        conferences but the reporters “never printed what they said.” Under
                        Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_TK3"
                            >Thanat</persName>'s speech last night was helpful.</p>
                    <p>The conversation again turned to Cambodia, the Under Secretary's next
                        destination. General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said
                        there were certainly more headaches there than in Thailand. Part of the
                        problem in Cambodia was that a number of people were competing for the
                        leadership. In Thailand, he said, there was no competition among the leaders
                        of the Group, <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0367"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> asked the Thai if they had any
                        advice they wanted to give us on Cambodia. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> said the best thing the U.S. could
                        do in Cambodia is to assist people who could bring stability to the country.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> and the others agreed that the two
                        who could do this were Lon Nol and Sirik Matak.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that at the time the Khmer
                        Government had announced the dissolution of their Parliament, they had
                        announced at the same time that they were establishing a Constituent
                        Assembly. This had greatly dampened down reaction in the U.S. to the
                        dissolution of the Parliament.</p>
                    <p>Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked Under
                        Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> to convey to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> his good wishes. He expressed the
                        hope that the President will understand that the actions taken by the
                        Revolutionary Group have been carefully considered and were taken to assure
                        the security and well-being of the people. He stressed their attachment to
                        the Constitutional Monarchy.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that there was in fact
                        stability in Thailand, but it is up to the Thai Government to get this
                        across to the public abroad. Pote asked again that Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> help to get this point across to
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister closed with the hope that the close relationships between
                        our two countries would be maintained. The Under Secretary assured him that
                        that was also his goal.</p>

                    <p>As you will recall, Dick Kennedy indicated several weeks ago that we had put
                        the pressure on the bureaucracy to resolve the Thai textile issue without
                        going to the President. Happily, the bureaucracy came up with a compromise
                        solution which was acceptable to the Thai. Accordingly, we are releasing
                        from embargo 18,000 dozen pairs of cotton pajamas, and the Thai are sending
                        a representative to Washington to negotiate a bilateral textile agreement.
                        Once that agreement is reached, we will release from embargo additional
                        50,000 dozen pairs of pajamas, which will be charged against Thailand's
                        negotiated quota next year.</p>

                    <p>A meeting of the Washington Special Actions Group (<gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                            >WSAG</gloss>) was held on December 23, 1971, in the White House
                        Situation Room to address the emergency situation created by the North
                        Vietnamese attacks in the Plain of Jars in Laos in the early morning of
                        December 18. The North attacked much earlier in the season and took
                        advantage of bad weather, which prevented U.S. tactical air forces from
                        effectively supporting Meo and Thai forces. The North Vietnamese also used
                        “highly accurate artillery fire” with the heaviest artillery pieces
                        (Soviet-made 130 mm field guns) they had ever used on the Plain.</p>
                    <p>The main <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> thrust was made at Fire Support
                        Bases Mustang and Lion, which were defended by Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1"

                            >Nelson</persName> said that the Thais had about 2,700 men deployed on
                        December 15 and that they had suffered an estimated 400 killed and 170
                        wounded. According to <persName corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName>, “The
                        Thai 609 battalion, at Fire Support Base Lion, was the worst hit. At one
                        time 200–300 enemy bodies were laying in the perimeter defense wire, while
                        Sting Ray Fire Support Base from Phou Seu provided covering 155 mm fire to
                        within 50 meters of their outposts. During the night of the 19th, elements
                        of the BG 609 requested permission to withdraw. Permission was denied, and
                        they were told to hold their position and that reinforcements were en route.
                        During the night of December 19–20, radio contact was lost with the BG 609,
                        while hand-to-hand combat activity was underway.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName> said that they fought “very well,”
                        and that the base had held until the “loss of the supporting Meo position
                        allowed enemy forces to employ direct fire weapons on the base, destroying
                        ammunition supplies, pinning gun crews and security troops down.”</p>
                    <p>Thai troops at Fire Support Bases King Kong and Panther (Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions 606–608) “fought a constant
                        battle” through December 20 and into December 21. They were told to abandon
                        King Kong on December 20. <persName corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName> said
                        that the “Thais put up a good fight. They withdrew in good order.” He then
                        described how three Meo and three Thai battalions, about 4,780 troops, had
                        arrived at the Ban Na/Pha Dong resistance line. He said that the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> didn't know “where three other Thai
                        battalions are,” that Ban Na/Pha Dong was “a very porous line,” and that all
                        the friendly forces artillery had been lost on the Plain of Jars, although
                        some of it was being replaced. He added that three Thai irregular battalions
                            (<gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>s 616, 617, and 618) of 1,403 men
                        had been taken out of training and had been airlifted into Long Tieng on
                        December 20 and 21.</p>
                    <p>When President's Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked whether regular Thai troops
                        were available as reinforcements, <persName corresp="#p_NWE1"
                            >Nelson</persName> supposed that they were, but said that “it's a
                        question of paying for them.” Under Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> then explained <pb
                            n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0370"/>that “we are not permitted to
                        support them. Symington's ceiling, as you know, is $350 million. One thing
                        we have to do today is decide how we are going to handle the ceiling.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName> then described how enemy
                        activity in South Laos had been light. The only critical area was around
                        Paksong, where two Thai battalions had been hit very hard 10 days before and
                        “rendered ineffective.” Still, he said, the “strength is with the Thais.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the high
                        option for the defense of Laos was “to continue to defend the Long Tieng
                        area and to undertake the defense of the area at the junction of routes 7
                        and 13,” and asked whether “we have the forces for the high option.” The
                        State Department's <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">William Sullivan</persName>
                        replied: “No, not unless we get Thai regulars. And unless the Thai
                        Government pays for the regulars, we don't have a Chinaman's chance of
                        getting them. (to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>)
                        Excuse me for mentioning your friends.”</p>
                    <p>To <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s question as to whether
                        the Thai military program (meaning the <gloss target="#t_AAT1">AAT</gloss>)
                        had been agreed to, <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that it was “close
                        to agreement. The last meeting was yesterday, and there are no outstanding
                        issues.” <persName corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName> then added that “I
                        understand that the Defense view is that there is no way to beat the ceiling
                        and that we should be honest and forthright with the Congress. The feeling
                        of the Secretary is that we should be honest and ask Congress for more
                        money.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> eventually decided to
                        obtain President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s guidance on
                        what steps, if any, to take to overcome the problem caused by the
                        Congressional ceiling of $350 million for expenditures in Laos in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. There was also considerable discussion
                        of providing more U.S. air support for the Meo and Thai forces in Laos.</p>
                    <p>In the end, the Thai volunteer <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>
                        battalions, combined with extensive U.S. air forces support (including B–52
                        bombers) permitted the U.S.-backed forces in Laos to survive this North
                        Vietnamese assault and to hold key positions such as Long Tieng. (National

                    <p>2.“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I am pleased that you took the initiative to write me about the current
                        situation in North Laos. You can be assured that I fully share the concern
                        which you have expressed and agree that urgent action is needed to meet this
                        increased threat. The reports which I have received make it clear that the
                        Thai irregular units in the Plaine des Jarres were courageous and effective
                        under intense attack and that they made the North Vietnamese pay dearly for
                        their gains.</p>
                    <p>The three specific objectives for our air effort, which you have out-lined,
                        accord completely with our own estimate of the most urgent requirements in
                        that field. I have directed that all necessary steps be taken to meet these
                        objectives. I hope that as the weather improves we will see positive results
                        in the next few days.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the measures which can appropriately be taken from the air,
                        there remain significant problems on the ground. The losses suffered in both
                        manpower and equipment will require urgent corrective action. In this
                        connection, I have directed the accelerated delivery of the equipment,
                        especially artillery, which will be needed for effective ground
                        defenses.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the manpower and deployment needs generated by the current
                        situation are matters to which you, together with Prime Minister <persName

                        attention.</p>

                            target="#t_LTG1">LTG</gloss> Samran Petyakul) emphasized to me the
                        special advantages enjoyed by the insurgents in his region. Among them, he
                        gave greatest weight to Communist control of contiguous areas in Laos, which
                        affords secure hinterland for the “liberated areas” in Thailand. To my
                        suggestion that friendly guerilla forces in Laos act as blocking forces for
                        Third Army initiatives, he observed that the former are heavily engaged
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>2. I took the occasion to stress that dealing with the insurgency is above
                        all a Thai responsibility and a vital Thai national interest. The <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> can help, but only as a supplement to what
                        basically has to be a Thai effort. I emphasized the vital necessity for Thai
                        commanders to use their resources effectively and energetically against the
                        insurgents.</p>
                    <p>3. Samran accepted this, and replied by describing important operations—using
                        both Third Army elements and forces from the Central Reserve—which are about
                        to be undertaken in the current dry season, as well as paramilitary programs
                        under development. Armed operations by the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> have proven necessary in the North (as contrasted with the
                        preferred “psychological operations” approach), because insurgent
                        operational bases are strongly held and inhabited by non-Thais. Hill people
                        share neither language, religion, nor loyalty to the King with the Thai, and
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> campaigns against opium growing are
                        also exploited by the Communists: hill populations therefore are
                        particularly vulnerable to Communist propaganda and recruitment efforts.
                        Nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> suppression efforts are
                        selective, and accompanied by efforts to win hill tribe loyalty. (The Thais
                        have, in fact, developed good plans and organization to deal with the
                        problem: implementation is now the issue.)</p>
                    <p>3. Although Samran emphasized the loyalty of the lowland Thai, I was struck
                        by his comment that about five percent of the valley population (especially
                        migrants from the Northeast) may be cooperating with the Communists. He also
                        agreed with my point that effective loyalty is often a function of the
                        government's ability to extend <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0373"
                        />protection, which is frequently difficult to do under conditions prevalent
                        in the north.</p>
                    <p>4. This visit strengthened my impression that the insurgency in the North is
                        a serious and growing threat: I hope that I was able to strengthen Samran's
                        resolution in dealing with it.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Chinese-supported Communist insurgency in Northern Thailand has been
                        steadily gaining strength. The number of armed Thai Communist insurgents
                            (<gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss>), estimated in 1968 to be some 250,
                        is (according to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) now over 3,100—2,300
                        full time and 800 village militia. Moreover, their weaponry has improved and
                        now reportedly includes mortars, machine guns, flamethrowers, grenade
                        launchers and anti-personnel mines as well as numerous <gloss
                            target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss>s and SKS carbines. It is not known
                        whether these weapons are coming direct from China or are from stockpiles in
                        Laos and North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> have made major
                        improvements in their politico-military organization and have formed some
                        small battalions. While most of their indigenous support has come from the
                        various hill tribes, the <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> are beginning to
                        make inroads among lowland Thai in the North.</p>
                    <p>The number of <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss>-initiated incidents in the
                        North jumped from none in 1966 to 947 in 1969, dropped to 589 in 1970, and
                        then rose to well over 1,000 in 1971. A January 2 NCNA report proclaimed
                        that “the <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0374"/>fighting efficiency of
                        the Thai Peoples Armed Forces markedly increased in 1971.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> believes that the
                        southward expansion of the Chinese road (and Chinese military presence) in
                        Laos and Communist military advances in Laos are closing the gap between the
                        external and internal threat to Thailand. He believes these developments
                        suggest that China continues to apply indirect but growing pressure upon
                        Thailand as a matter of policy, not merely “as casual encouragement of what
                        has been erroneously characterized as a chronic, low-level dissidence.”
                        Unger further believes that if these developments proceed on their current
                        course, they could eventually diminish Thai ability to play a significant
                        role in the stabilization of Laos, and undermine the internal development
                        and stability of Thailand.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Peking's Role</p>
                    <p>The leading Chinese role in the Thai insurgency is ill-disguised. The
                        insurgency radio, the “Voice of the People of Thailand,” broadcasts from
                        China and has unabashedly extolled the virtues of “Mao Tse-tung thought.”
                            <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> cadre adhere strictly to Maoist
                        ideology. The Thai Communist Party and its “<gloss target="#t_NLF1"
                            >NLF</gloss>,” the Thai Patriotic Front, seem to be led by exiles now
                        resident in China.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese road building operation in Laos—now involving over 30,000
                        construction and anti-aircraft troops—seems to have little purpose other
                        than to provide direct access to Thailand from China and North Vietnam (See
                        map at Tab A). Significantly, these roads point to the area where the <gloss
                            target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> are strongest (See map at Tab B). Since roads
                        such as these are not needed to meet present <gloss target="#t_CT1"
                            >CT</gloss> resupply demands, it seems likely they are intended to
                        support a considerably increased insurgency in Thailand.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Hanoi's Role</p>
                    <p>Hanoi is also involved in supporting the Thai insurgency; but its role is
                        strictly secondary to that of Peking and is largely confined to
                        North-eastern Thailand. The North Vietnamese (and perhaps the Pathet Lao)
                        have trained Thai cadre and have helped supply the <gloss target="#t_CT1"
                            >CT</gloss>. Many of the 40–50,000 North Vietnamese living in Thailand
                        are under Hanoi's influence and constitute a serious potential fifth column.
                        Recently Hanoi-controlled media claimed that Thai insurgents are actively
                        supporting their comrades in Indochina and cited as evidence the January
                        sapper attack on our B–52 base at U Tapao. Hanoi has, of course, strongly
                        attacked the presence of Thai troops in Laos as well as Thai-Cambodian
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Thai Countermeasures</p>
                    <p>The Thai Government has become increasingly concerned about the growing
                        insurgency in the North and Northeast and plans a <pb n="326"

                        In fact, a major military campaign has just recently been launched against

                        President's eight-point peace proposal was acceptable in principle to the
                        Thai Government as an attempt at a solution to the long term problem.
                        However, whatever the outcome of the present difficulties in North and South
                        Vietnam, Thailand's security would be affected. The Chairman of the National
                        Executive Council (Thanom) felt that Thailand should have been consulted in
                        connection with the eight-point program. The <gloss target="#t_NEC1"
                            >NEC</gloss> now expected that there may be a new <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> proposal for Vietnam which would have the effect of
                        involving or even endangering Thai security. As an ally and deeply involved,
                        Thailand should be consulted.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG2">Brown</persName> asked whether this
                        meant that the Thai wished to be consulted on any future proposal that we
                        might make in Paris. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HS5"
                            >Sunthorn</persName> said yes. Ambassador Brown pointed out that we did
                        not know what the outcome (of the eight-point proposal) will be nor whether
                        there will be any new proposals. We would wish to think over what the
                        Ambassador requested. There were many people involved. Would a similar
                        approach be made to Ambassador Unger? Sunthorn said he thought so. His
                        government felt the eight-point program had already made substantial
                        concessions to North Vietnam. Any further concession would be detrimental to
                        the interests of Thailand and the United States.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG2">Brown</persName> asked what worried
                        the Thai especially. Sunthorn said his government had not specified, but
                        they were particularly concerned about anything affecting the security of
                        Laos and Cambodia, which would automatically affect Thailand's security.
                        They wished to see nothing occur which would let North Vietnam control the
                        whole of those two countries. Ambassador Brown said that we had no interest
                        in seeing Thai security unfavorably affected or North Vietnam's taking over
                        Laos and Cambodia. We appreciated very much what Thailand had already done.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG2">Brown</persName> suggested that the
                        problems of Laos and Cambodia would be dealt with after Vietnam was
                        settled.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HS5">Sunthorn</persName> said yes, he thought it was a
                        package deal. A stalemate, especially in South Vietnam, might lead to
                        increased North Vietnamese action in Laos and Cambodia. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWG2">Brown</persName> said we would see what could be done
                        to bring the Thai more into the picture. He would consult with Ambassador
                        Sullivan and the Secretary on the latter's return.<note n="3"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>In 1949–50 <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> (Kuomingtang–Chinese
                        Nationalist) troops under General Li Mi were driven out of Yunnan into
                        Burma, where they settled despite the protests and military efforts of the
                        Burmese to dislodge them. In 1953–54 and again in the early 1960's many of
                        these <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>'s were evacuated to Taiwan, and
                        the Government of the Republic of China no longer has any control over those
                        who stayed behind. The remaining forces, now mostly in Thailand, have
                        gradually assumed a more local character through recruitment but have
                        remained an effective military force, probably the best in the tri-border
                        area. Now known as the “Chinese Irregular Forces” (<gloss target="#t_CIF1"
                            >CIF</gloss>'s), they are under the leadership of Generals Li Wen-Huan
                        and Tuan Hsi-Wen.</p>
                    <p>Over the years the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s have acquired
                        control over most of the illegal opium traffic from eastern Burma and
                        northern Thailand to Bangkok. Operating in terrain they know better than the
                        government forces, profiting heavily from “protection” and trade in opium,
                        and fighting when they have to, the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s
                        became a law unto themselves.</p>
                    <p>For the past year or two the Thai Government, faced with an increasing
                        Communist insurgency in the north and recognizing the bad effects the opium
                        trade was having on Thailand's reputation, has sought to settle the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s and make useful residents out of them. To
                        this end the Thai promised that if the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s
                        would turn their forces <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>'s relations with

                        of Supreme Command, who has been well and favorably known to us for many

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Opium Trade</p>
                    <p>Recognizing the increasing problem of the illicit opium trade, the Thai
                        Government sought to get the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s out of
                        the business. Li and Tuan said they were willing to give it up, but they
                        needed 20 million baht (equivalent to $1 million) to dispose of their
                        obligations and opium procurement agreements and to settle their followers.
                        While the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> was able to put aside some
                        funds for resettlement purposes, they could not allocate this additional
                        amount, so General <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>
                        approached us for assistance. After careful consideration in Bangkok and
                        Washington, agreement was reached on the form and amount of U.S. assistance.
                        An essential consideration from the Thai point of view was that Li and Tuan
                        were not to be aware that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was the
                        eventual source of funds. U.S. funds are to be provided from <gloss

                    <p>While we recognize that it is unlikely that our support of Thai efforts to
                        resettle the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s will put a complete stop
                        to opium trafficking in northern Thailand, the U.S./<gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> agreement will enable us to hold <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                            >Kriangsak</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        responsible for any violations by the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s.
                        The removal of 28 tons of opium from illicit channels and its destruction
                        will have a major impact on the quantity available for consumption outside
                        the indigenous market. The resettlement scheme if successful may make
                        productive citizens out of a group of several thousand freebooters. Finally,
                        the possibility of further use of the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss>'s
                        as a force against the Communist insurgents in northern Thailand will be
                        enhanced.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> and other top Thai leaders, Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> described background of
                        President's Peking trip, assuring the Thais that there was no change in U.S.
                        commitments to them and emphasizing the positive benefits that will accrue
                        to them if our diplomacy succeds. Green stressed that continued U.S.
                        strength and close bonds with allies such as Thailand are essential to
                        success of our diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>He also emphasized that this diplomacy, which enjoys broad support at home,
                        will give the President enhanced ability to carry out the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and thus put U.S. policy on
                        a firm and steady course on which allies can rely. The Thais were deeply
                        appreciative of this <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0380"/>consultation
                        and of the reassurances that <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> was
                        able to give. Thanom expressed deep concern about the growing level of
                        insurgency in Thailand and Chinese support thereof, and asked if latter
                        would continue. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> discussed
                        possibilities but said we must await results to see if our diplomacy
                        affected this. Thais obviously will be watching this one closely. Thanom
                        also stressed heavily the need for continuing U.S. economic and military
                        assistance in face of the massive aid the other side is receiving from its
                        backers, and his concern about Congressional attitudes on this question. He
                        also reiterated his earlier appeal for consultations prior to any U.S.
                        decisions on matters affecting Thai security. <hi rend="italic">End

                    <p>1. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> met with
                            <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> to discuss President's Peking visit beginning at 2:00
                        p.m. March 8, <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> was accompanied
                        by Deputy Chairman <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>,
                        Assistant Chairman Pote Sarasin, Air Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                            >Dawee</persName>, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
                        Charunphan, and Director of Southeast Asia Division, Ministry of Foreign
                        Affairs, Asa Sarasin (Pote's son). Green was accompanied by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, Mr. Holdridge, <gloss
                            target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                        counselor.</p>
                    <p>2. Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>, with <persName
                            corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> interpreting, expressed great pleasure
                        at opportunity to received President's special representative and his
                        appreciation of opportunity to hear at first hand about the Peking talks and
                        especially about the effects these talks would have on Thailand and
                        Southeast Asia. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> responded by
                        conveying to the Thai leadership from the President the latter's warmest
                        wishes and highest regards and esteem, as well as those of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. He then outlined briefly
                        the role that he and Mr. Holdridge had played in the talks and the mandate
                        the President had given him in connection with his present mission.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> went on to describe briefly
                        the steps taken by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        leading to his Peking trip, beginning with the article in Foreign Affairs of
                        October 1967. He stressed that the President had succeeded in removing
                        barriers between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> so as
                        to permit the establishment of a dialouge with Peking without sacrificing
                        our relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> or anyone else.
                        He recalled that all our defense commitments including that to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss>, were specifically and publicly reiterated
                        in Shanghai at the time the Communiqué was released.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> emphasized the responsive
                        chord which the President's diplomacy had struck among the American people,
                        who strongly desired that some opening for peace be sought. Successful China
                        diplomacy would greatly strengthen the President's hand in all respects and
                        reinvigorate U.S. foreign policy across the board. Better relations between
                        Washington and Peking could in turn open a real opportunity to move the
                        world in a better direction. However, he said this could <pb n="332"
                            xml:id="pg_332" facs="0381"/>come about only if the U.S. remains strong
                        and retains its close bonds with its allies to whom the U.S. must continue
                        to provide adequate support. He said the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        was interested in a better relationship with us because of our power and
                        influence in the world.</p>
                    <p>5. He explored the reason why the Chinese wanted to hold these talks, which
                        they strongly desired. He noted however that it was very important to avoid
                        public speculation about these reasons, which could interfere with the
                        achievement of the goals of our China diplomacy with no offsetting
                        advantage. He cited a) Chinese fear of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, reflected inter alia by widespread construction of air
                        raid shelters; b) deep-running Chinese worry about the possibility of
                        resurgent Japanese militarism; and c) great internal change and past turmoil
                        in China, in the wake of which the general move had been away from
                        extremism. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> produced a chart
                        dramatizing this point which the Thais found most interesting.</p>
                    <p>6. The result, we believe, had led the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> to
                        realize, even though it would not say so, that it is not in its interest to
                        have the U.S. withdraw rapidly from Asia. They do not want a vacuum created
                        into which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might move. They may be
                        coming to realize that Japanese militarism (which we feel the Japanese will
                        reject) is less likely to reemerge if a U.S.-Japanese relationship
                        continues. Noting that their rhetoric may not always reflect this change of
                        attitude, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stressed the
                        importance of encouraging them in positive acts without stopping to examine
                        too closely their motives or being too concerned about their rhetoric.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> described the process of
                        drafting the communiqué. The Chinese ha d put up positions on certain
                        controversial issues which we answered point by point. There was no attempt
                        to paper over the differences, some of which were very fundamental. In
                        addition to this, however, there were areas where agreement could be
                        expressed, including the necessity to avoid the outbreak of war; opposition
                        to hegemony or spheres of influence; and adherence to the “five principles”
                        which go back to the Bandung period. He noted that when these latter were
                        first enunciated, it was in an undesirable propaganda context which led
                        Secretary Dulles to refuse acceptance of them. In fact, however, the points
                        were in themselves unexceptionable. We now have a joint <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>–U.S. commitment to them on the record and
                        intend in the future to hold this commitment before the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. He noted that we also expressed the hope
                        for better conditions for the Chinese people which in our view will help
                        further to move the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> away from
                        extremism.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stressed that no secret deals
                        had been made, that there were no negotiations except on the communiqué and
                        no attempt to deal with third country problems.</p>
                    <p>9. To sum up, he said the U.S. side has no illusions, but feels that some
                        opening for peace has been made which can successfully be exploited <pb
                            n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0382"/>in close concert and consultation
                        with our friends. He emphasized again that we must speak from strength,
                        extending a friendly hand but remaining on guard. He said he would upon his
                        departure from Thailand make a stronger statement of reassurance than he had
                        made or would make in any other country he was visiting.</p>
                    <p>10. Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> expressed sincere
                        thanks for this background. He noted that at a meeting with the Japanese
                        Chief of Staff, who is currently visiting Thailand, he had expressed the
                        view, completely in agreement with that of Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, that Chinese fear of Russia and Japan
                        had motivated them to take part in these talks.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> posed the question of
                        whether the U.S. or the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> initiated the
                        talks. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said the initiative had
                        really come from both sides. As he had noted, the President's indications of
                        desire for a dialogue went back to 1967, and the Chinese since then had
                        increasingly found reasons which made it desirable from their point of view.
                        In the end, after portraying Americans as devils for 20 years, the Chinese
                        had come to the point where pictures of Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> smiling at President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> were carred on the front pages of all
                        their newspapers.</p>
                    <p>12. Thanom noted that there was nothing in the communiqué on Thailand, and
                        said he presumed therefore that there was no change in Thai-U.S. relations
                        and that the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment and the
                        Rusk–Thanat communiqué remained in effect. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> confirmed this. He said none of our alliances or
                        commitments were mentioned in the communiqué. He recalled that we took up in
                        the communiqué only those controversial items the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> mentioned. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> did not
                        raise either the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment or
                        Thailand. However, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said Marshal
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> was entirely correct in
                        assuming that all UMS commitments to Thailand remain in effect and
                        unchanged.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked specifically whether
                        the Chinese had raised the question of U.S. use of Thai bases. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> replied that they had not.</p>
                    <p>14 <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> recalled that in 1969,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during his visit to
                        Thailand had described to him the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine as it affected Thailand. He said he had found
                        this extremely reassuring and assumed from what had been said that there was
                        no change in this policy. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        confirmed that there was no change.</p>
                    <p>15. Thanon then asked whether Project Taksin also continued in effect.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> noted that while it
                        is still in existence, Project Taksin is a military plan which takes a
                        political decision to make it operative, not a commitment per se. Therefore
                        it is in a different category from the other matters mentioned.</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said he planned to stress in
                        his departure statement that he recognize that our own interest required
                        maintenace of our commitments to Thailand and our other allies and
                        continuing contributions <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0383"/>to the
                        strength of our allies through economic and military assistance. He said he
                        would also stress our readiness to consult closely with Thailand and our
                        commitment not to negotiate behind its back.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> noted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had reiterated its policy of supporting
                        wars of liberation. To Thailand, he said, “liberation” means terrorism and
                        disruption of public administration and public safety. He noted that the
                        Communist terrorists in Thailand are using Chinese equipment including
                        modern anti-tank weapons, rockets and small arms. He asked whether that
                        could continue.</p>
                    <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> recalled that the President
                        has said we can only judge by results. He noted again that the Chinese have
                        now expressed themselves publicly along with us against interference in
                        other sovereign countries. In the future, to involve themselves in such
                        activities will expose them to charges of bad faith, and we must hold this
                        commitment before them. He anticipated that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> will continue to use the jargon of wars of national
                        liberation, but he believes their real concerns have turned in other
                        direction. He foresaw no dramatic immediate change but if our general
                        diplomacy succeeds their support of such activity may diminish. Even before
                        the visit, we had concluded that their policy would move in the direction of
                        greater caution, of attempting to “exploit external and internal
                        contradictions” of other countries, i.e., a shift to “talk-talk” tactics.
                        This trend is currently manifesting itself in the slogan “long live Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>'s revolutionary diplomatic
                        line.” He said the Chinese know that Thailand is a close friend of the
                        United States. China wants a better relationship with us. This may give us
                        some additional leverage on their actions vis-à-vis Thailand.</p>
                    <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked about the current
                        relationship between the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> said that two or three years ago, the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> simply wanted us bogged down in Vietnam
                        until, on a wave of disillusionment in the U.S., we would be swept out of
                        Asia entirely. Now they are coming to see a continuation of the Vietnam War
                        as redounding to the benefit of the Soviet Union, not to their own benefit.
                        He said that as the war continues, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        as the supplier of the more advanced weaponry needed by Hanoi becomes more
                        and more identified with Hanoi's goal of victory and will be the principal
                        beneficiary if the goal is achieved. The Chinese seem more interested now in
                        seeing the war end fairly soon.</p>
                    <p>20. Holdridge expressed agreement with this. He said the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had voiced support for attainment of
                        Communist “goals” in Southeast Asia without defining the latter beyond
                        expressing agreement with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s 7-points
                        and the two-point elaboration. They at no time became more specific than
                        this and they lent no additional weight to Hanoi's positions. The impression
                        left was that their assistance to Hanoi would continue in order to avoid
                        leaving the field entirely to the Soviets but <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335"
                            facs="0384"/>that they would not support any expansion of the conflict.
                        Implicit in it all was that the U.S. role in Indochina would not stand in
                        the way of a developing relationship with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss>, and that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was more
                        interested in Northeast Asia, particularly the Soviet Union, Japan and
                        Taiwan, than in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> expressed the view that the
                        North Vietnamese were afraid of being inundated by Chinese advisors, which
                        was another reason which led them to turn to the Russians for more
                        assistance. But he noted that while heavy equipment was coming from Russia,
                        small arms, uniforms, etc. were coming from China.</p>
                    <p>22. Returning to the Thai insurgency problem, Thanom said Chinese equipment
                        had showed up in every region of Thailand where insurgency existed. Since
                        the talks in Peking were agreed to, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        has carried out extensive operations in the North and Northeast destroying
                        Communist base camps. In connection with these they had intercepted
                        communications from the enemy requesting more equipment, weapons, medicine
                        and food from China by land and by heliocopter. He said the Chinese are
                        deeply involved and so far have shown no signs of stopping or reducing their
                        involvement. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> recognized this to
                        date and repeated that we can only await results but our diplomacy may offer
                        a road to an easing of the problem.</p>
                    <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that he wanted to make
                        it explicit, as he had done yesterday in Phnom Penh and Vientiane, that we
                        are not aligning with China against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, or getting involved in the Sino-Soviet split. He recalled
                        that the President would visit Moscow to seek a better dialogue with the
                        Soviets. In this connection, he noted that before the President went to
                        Peking, Gromyko was visiting Tokyo. At that point the Chinese eased their
                        hostile anti-Japanese propaganda line. Adding that he did not believe the
                        Japanese would move into the Soviet orbit, he said the net result might be
                        an escalation toward peace. He said the U.S. goal was to further this kind
                        of phenomenon, to establish a better relationship among the great powers
                        from which all nations can benefit.</p>
                    <p>24. Thanom said it was at one time understandable that the Vietnamese should
                        be “liberated” from the French, and the other former colonies from the
                        metropolitan states, but the Thais are puzzled as to whom they are to be
                        liberated from. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said the Chinese
                        leadership, after a life-time of struggle, take struggle as the normal
                        condition of life. The rhetoric of “liberation” has become second nature to
                        them. In a case such as Thailand, which has always been independent, the
                        rhetoric and slogans may increasingly be exposed as empty and meaningless.
                        Our aim must be to turn the Chinese leaders around in practice without
                        worrying too much about their rhetoric.</p>
                    <p>25. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> reiterated that the
                        terrorist movement in Thailand is an extremely serious danger to Thailand
                        today. Thailand would help <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0385"/>itself
                        and would not need U.S. ground forces. But so long as the aggressors are
                        being given outside support, Thailand would need support, including economic
                        aid. Yet Congress now seemed inclined to cut aid to Thailand. This concerns
                        them greatly. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> agreed to report
                        this concern<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> met with President <persName

                                >Green</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TK5"

                            others had “all expressed their support, although they all were

                            (see <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>) had been particularly
                            strong on the need for continued U.S. aid to cope with the insurgency.”
                            (Ibid.)</note> and to support their request for continued
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked whether it was true
                        that the North Vietnamese had sent people to Peking to meet with the
                        Americans while the President was there. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> said this was a pure canard.</p>
                    <p>27. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> noted that <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had gone to Hanoi during the
                        President's visit which further identified <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName> with the North Vietnamese and thus further hurt
                        himself with his own people.</p>
                    <p>28. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> referred to the open letter
                        which appeared in the Bangkok <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> on the day of
                        his arrival (Bangkok U.S. info 071150Z Mar). This was quickly and
                        emphatically disclaimed by the <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that among the many
                        errors in the letter was the assertion that the U.S. has accepted a “One
                        China” policy. He said both Peking and Taipei claim that there is only one
                        China of which Taiwan is a part and that we have simply noted and do not
                        challenge these positions. The Chinese themselves must resolve this matter.
                        We will not pressure Taipei one way or the other. He expressed the view that
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would show some patience and that it
                        was now even more unlikely that it would resort to force in seeking to take
                        over Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>29. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> noted that the commitment to
                        ultimate withdrawal of forces from Taiwan was linked to a reduction of
                        tension in the area; he found this very reassuring. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> noted also that with respect to the
                        Indochina area the commitment to ultimate withdrawal was conditional, being
                        tied in the case to self-determination for the countries of Indochina. With
                        respect to the use of the term “region”, <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> said that was intended to indicate that forces
                        providing support to countries in Indochina from outside could also be
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>30. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> recalled the approach he had
                        recently directed to be made concerning the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss>'s desire to be consulted before decisions are made
                        affecting its security (Bangkok 2458). He said this could be done through
                        our Ambassador here with the Foreign Office or directly with him, or through
                        the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> Ambassador in Washington. The
                        important thing was that true consultations be held in all cases where
                        Thailand's security interests are involved. It was not enough to be informed
                        of major <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0386"/>U.S. moves an hour or so
                        in advance. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said he fully
                        understood and would convey this point to Washington highest levels.</p>
                    <p>31. Marshal <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName>, recalling that
                        Thailand has 3–4 million Chinese residents, asked about the future of the
                        Republic of China. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that,
                        while he of course could not predict the future, following his talks with
                        the leaders in Taipei, particularly <persName corresp="#p_JJC1">Chiang
                            Ching-Kuo</persName>, they seemed to feel much more assured. He noted
                        that their economy is doing well and that they have strong links of trade
                        with many countries around the world which will continue. Noting again that
                        our commitment to withdraw is highly conditional, he said we expect to draw
                        down our forces in Taiwan from 8,500 to 2,000 in connection with
                        Vietnamization, but he expected that the latter figure would be held to for
                        the indefinite future pending resolution of the Taiwan issue.</p>
                    <p>32. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> recalled that, like the Thai
                        leaders, the President has been effectively combating Communist aggression
                        for many years and that he is very realistic. The President knows that
                        strength and continued close ties with our allies are a prerequisite to our
                        ability to deal successfully with Peking. But the President had also
                        concluded that the time had come when traditional diplomacy had to give way
                        to inspired action in order to make a breakthrough which would be in the
                        interest of all. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that this
                        thirty years of diplomatic service led him to the conviction that this was
                        the kind of effort which would win worldwide support, convincing people that
                        things can improve. He felt that this was particularly important with
                        respect to our younger people.</p>
                    <p>33. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that the principal
                        purpose of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine was to
                        reverse a feeling widely shared by Americans that the U.S. is over-involved
                        around the world, in order to avoid a reaction which would lead to
                        under-involvment. In other words, the President sought to put U.S. foreign
                        policy on a steady course which allies could bank on and on which they could
                        base their own planning. In terms of reductions in U.S. forces, however, the
                        President has concluded that the point had now been reached where there must
                        be a pause (except for Vietnamization). He quoted from Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>'s recent report concerning this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>34. Following a brief exchange about press handling (see Bangkok 3298 for

                    <p>1. Following <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss> Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>'s dinner for our party March 8, I
                        drew Chairman <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> aside (with Pote
                        Sarasin interpreting and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName> also present) to mention a particularly sensitive
                        point which I wished he would not share with anyone else in his government.
                        I referred to his conversation of January 14 with Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">A report of that conversation was transmitted
                            in telegram 597 from Bangkok, January 14. (Ibid.)</note> in which
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> had asked that we take up
                        in our Peking talks Thailand's concern over <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> support of insurgents and terrorists against lawful
                        government and innocent people of Thailand, and to point out that <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> had stopped its anti-Peking broadcasts and
                        wanted to have better relationships with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        on basis of non-interference in each other's internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>2. I said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                        specifically mentioned this point in one of his meetings with <gloss
                            target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> Chi Peng Fei. Chi's response had been
                        along the lines that (a) China had historically maintained good relations
                        with the Thai people but, after Chiang's troops had fled to Thailand the
                        latter had made use of these troops, relations had deteriorated; (b)
                        Thailand had opposed China and the Communists including interference in
                        Indo-China and hence there were no diplomatic relations now; (c) new Thai
                        Government pursues the same old policies but we (<gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss>) do not interfere in internal affairs of Thailand; (d)
                        people of Thailand want revolution and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        hopes that it will come to have normal state relations on basis of five
                        principles. Chi had added: “We hope you will convey this to your good
                        friends in Thailand.” Chi then said, I continued, that as for Thai charges
                        about Peking supported guerrillas in Thailand, <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> admits some Thai guerrilla leaders are in Peking but how
                        the guerrillas carry on in Thailand is their affair; we don't interfere.</p>
                    <p>Chi had ended by saying that U.S. and Thailand have their principles, and
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has its own; nevertheless we can
                        work for an improvement of state relations.</p>

                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_PS5">Pote Sarasin</persName> expressed great appreciation
                        for Secretary having taken this up and commented that Peking's response was
                        pretty much as expected. Thanom felt that, to the extent the U.S.–<gloss

                        its course, this could prove in time to be of real benefit to Thailand. I

                    </p>
                    <p>1. On March 9 Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        was received by His Majesty the King. Also present were the Under Secretary
                        of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Charunpan, the King's Aide-de-Camp,
                        Admiral Diskul, Mr. Holdridge and myself. Our conversation lasted about one
                        hour and forty five minutes.</p>
                    <p>2. After conveying the appropriate expressions to His Majesty from President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> proceeded to describe at length the President's visit
                        to China and the discussions which took place there in terms very similar to
                        those of the previous day before the <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss>,
                        which meeting is recorded in reftel. Emphasis was put on those points which
                        I had identified to <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> as being of
                        particular interest and concern to the King.</p>
                    <p>3. His Majesty showed immediate understanding of the importance of the trip
                        in the light of the situation in the U.S. and particularly the attitudes of
                        young people there. He saw the value of the trip to the President in
                        establishing better understanding with some alienated groups in the U.S. and
                        therefore providing support for the President to enable him to carry out his
                        larger programs. The King understood the value this also could have with
                        regard to U.S. programs in Thailand.</p>
                    <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0389"/>
                    <p>4. Otherwise, however, the King tended to minimize the possibility of this
                        reopening of contact between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> having any beneficial effect on the policy or actions of
                        the latter. He discussed at length his view about Chinese intentions,
                        particularly in Southeast Asia, where he feels that the Chinese are
                        determined to establish their dominance. He cited maps which are a standard
                        item in Chinese schools which show Thailand as an integral part of China and
                        he is persuaded that the Chinese are not likely to be deterred from trying
                        to make it so. Whatever might be our good intentions, he professed to be
                        virtually persuaded that Thailand will be gobbled up. The King insisted that
                        while the Chinese had very good understanding of Westerners, the reverse was
                        not the case and he implied that our reestablished contact with the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> may lead us to some false conclusions and
                        unrealistic expectations.</p>
                    <p>4. In respectful terms but in firm tones <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> challenged the implication that the U.S. would stand
                        idly by and let her allies be taken over, pointing out that the U.S. has
                        been second to none in the world in standing by its friends, he also
                        insisted that we are in fact looking at the matter of reestablishing
                        relations with the PRC entirely realistically and without false illusions.
                        Moreover, we have a number of individuals who are exceptionally well
                        informed about China and have worked almost all their lives on this one
                        subject. He cited Mr. Holdridge as a case in point. Somewhat chastened, his
                        Majesty made conciliatory comments to the effect that he recognized the
                        desirability of the President's initiative on China in terms of the
                        interests of America's friends as well as of the United States itself.</p>
                    <p>5. Most of the remaining discussion related to U.S. assistance to Thai armed
                        forces and police in the field of helicopter and Stol aircraft, a subject
                        which His Majesty has raised with me innumerable times in the past. After
                        indicating his reluctant conclusion that the U.S. would not be providing
                        further aircraft to the Thai National Police His Majesty then also commented
                        on our apparent unwillingness or inability to provide a substantial
                        additional number of UH–1H aircraft for the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1"
                            >RTAF</gloss>. He did not mention the large number of UH–1Hs which are
                        in the program for the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss>, nor did he
                        accept the explanation that the Thai Armed Forces themselves are not seeking
                        additional helicopters for the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> around 25 of the UH–1Hs now in surplus
                        in Vietnam and awaiting shipment elsewhere. I said we would look into this
                        immediately and also mentioned that we are seeking helicopters from that
                        source ourselves to accelerate considerably the delivery already scheduled
                        for the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss>, as well as a few additional
                        helicopters for the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. In the course of this discussion the King commented that he could
                        understand that the Ambassador might be afraid to press for <pb n="341"
                            xml:id="pg_341" facs="0390"/>some of these urgent needs of Thailand for
                        fear of risking criticism in Washington. I replied that if I ever felt that
                        I was unable or unwilling to report things from Thailand as I saw them, or
                        make recommendations according to my best judgment, I would ask to be
                        transferred the next day. His Majesty said perhaps he had gone too far but
                        he was again critical of the bureaucratic complications and trials in
                        meeting what he saw as urgent needs for his country in a deteriorating
                        security situation. In the course of this discussion the King, on a number
                        of occasions, was also sharply critical of the present Thai government, and
                        armed services.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: This was at times an uncomfortable
                        audience, although I was not greatly surprised. I have had a number of
                        lengthy discussions with His Majesty over recent months, particularly on the
                        subject of U.S. aid programs and some of his favorite projects for which he
                        expects prompt and full support. The King's frustration with his own
                        government is understandable and may be aggravated by his dissatisfaction
                        with his own status in the absence of a constitution. There are some delays
                        and shortfalls on our part which also can be justifiably criticized. On the
                        other hand, the strong and sometimes even intemperate nature of his comments
                        probably arises in part from his lack of experience with criticism from his
                        own people and limited opportunities for full and frank discussion with his
                        subjects. I believe he appreciated the effort to convey to him our
                        impressions and conclusions growing out of the President's visit to China
                        and while he, and most other Thais, are very skeptical of seeing an end to
                        Chinese interference in Thailand's internal affairs, he probably accepts the
                        usefulness of the resumption of communication between the <gloss

                        <item>Conclusion for Textile Negotiations for Thailand</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>After a history of frustrating negotiations and discussions marked by
                        misunderstanding on the part of both sides, we have concluded a highly
                        successful agreement with Thailand which will result in their voluntarily
                        restraining the amount of cotton textiles they export to the U.S. The Thai
                        are extremely satisfied with this agreement as is the U.S. domestic textile
                        industry. This may be one of the few times in history that such an unlikely
                        and mutually satisfactory outcome has been arrived at! For this reason
                        alone, I believe it appropriate to send the letter at Tab A to <persName
                            corresp="#p_PPG1">Pete Peterson</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">A copy of the letter, signed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and dated March 28, is
                            attached but not printed. In it <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> compliments Nehmer and states: “I understand
                            that the Thai are extremely pleased with the agreement, and that it was
                            also completely acceptable to our domestic textile industry.”</note>
                        complimenting his department and his negotiator Stanley Nehmer.</p>
                    <p>There is also another reason for doing so. Commerce will play a key role in
                        enforcing the textile agreements worked out by <persName corresp="#p_KDM1"
                            >David Kennedy</persName> with Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South
                        Korea. Our ability to delicately and discreetly importune them to be
                        flexible in these negotiations could be extremely important in foreign
                        policy terms. The letter, by complimenting Nehmer on his outstanding job in
                        reconciling foreign policy and domestic interests will be helpful in any
                        future efforts we may make in importuning him to apply a similar measure of
                        flexibility in the future.</p>

                        very favorable statement. The reports we've had out of our Embassy have all
                        been favorable as a follow up. Now they would say, ‘Well, the Chinese say
                        they believe in these five principles but we know damn well they don’t.' And
                        I said, ‘Well, we’re not saying that we think they've reformed but now we
                        have at least mutually accepted standards to hold them by.'”</p>

                        into office here who's had more background in foreign affairs. He's not
                        being difficult. He's practical, and his approach to this problem is, as a
                        matter of fact, to the extent that we can make progress [unclear].”</p>
                    <p>

                        hell of a lot safer out there for those people if we had some stroke with
                        China rather than if we had to have our stroke against them. That's my
                        opinion.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: “Suppose that we just—suppose
                        the Chinese thing made a run at Thailand. And suppose the Thais said, ‘Look,
                        we have a treaty with you.’ Do you see an American President going down to
                        the Congress and saying, ‘We’re going to declare war on China to keep our
                        treaty commitments with Thailand?' Huh? We've got to let them think that. I
                        mean we can't say that our treaty commitments are not going to be kept, and
                        the Chinese better think they're gonna be kept. But the practical problem,
                        that's what we've got to face, is that at the present time, except for
                        Western Europe there are damn few places where you would get support. You
                        wouldn't even get it now on Israel. Not today.”</p>

                    <p>This letter is in reply to your telegram 4552<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2"
                            >Telegram 4552 from Bangkok, April 1, reported Asa Sarasin's request

                    <p>I think that about all we can tell the Thai, even privately, is something
                        along the following lines—which you can attribute to me if you wish: “We
                        expect that the Ambassadorial talks in Paris will move rather slowly. They
                        will be dealing with bilateral matters, centering on US–<gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> trade and on travel between the two
                        countries. If there is anything of interest to the Thai we will keep them
                        informed.”</p>
                    <p>For your information only, we are working out with <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> Ambassador Huang the ground rules for the discussions, and
                        we hope to get agreement or at least acquiescence that we will keep some
                        friendly countries informed in general terms of the progress of the talks,
                        on a confidential basis. Until the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has

                    <p>58624. For Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>1. We believe it is important for you to give Thai leadership an
                        authoritative impression of the President's view of the current situation in
                        South Viet-Nam and the United States response to that situation. We wish you
                        to seek appointment with <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName>, and such others of Thai
                        leadership whom you may consider appropriate to give them that impression as
                        soon as possible.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Telegram 4792 from Bangkok,

                            message from the President. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. You may tell them that we regard this North Vietnamese attack as a
                        clear-cut invasion across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, in which
                        they have thrown away any pretense of “people's war” tactics. Because they
                        have committed their forces so heavily, we assume this is an all-out effort
                        to discredit Vietnamization, to demoralize both the Vietnamese and the U.S.
                        public, and to create a favorable military position from which they will
                        hope to dictate favorable peace terms. We take this threat seriously, but we
                        regard it as vulnerable on both political and military grounds.</p>
                    <p>3. From our initial assessments, we believe the South Vietnamese forces are
                        reacting with confidence and with an effective plan to contain this initial
                        thrust, while positioning themselves for additional attacks which they
                        expect elsewhere in South Viet-Nam. Their civilian services are coping with
                        the refugee flow and the other disruptions resulting from this attack.</p>
                    <p>4. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is determined that
                        the North Vietnamese plan shall not succeed. He has already ordered a
                        significant reinforcement of U.S. air and naval forces in the area. He is
                        reviewing the situation carefully to determine what other actions may be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>5. You may inform the Thai leaders that we appreciate the steadfast attitude
                        they have displayed in the face of this threat to our common interests. You
                        should express particular appreciation for their <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347"
                            facs="0396"/>rapid and favorable responses to our requests for

                    </p>
                    <p>6. FYI: The President has just approved a recommendation for the deployment
                        of additional U.S. air units (fighter-bombers) from the continental United
                        States to Thai bases. You should not mention this fact to the Thai leaders
                        but should stay in close touch with U.S. military authorities in
                        anticipation of such action. End FYI.</p>
                    <p>7. We would welcome any views Thai leaders wish to express and will hope to
                        continue consultations with them as the military action develops.</p>

                    <p>The recent, excellent Thai performance probably results from their year of

                            Phu Kwang 10-day operation cost approximately 4 million baht and that a
                            number of Communist insurgent camps had been captured in the North.
                            Thanom mentioned that several <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> camps
                            had been captured in the South. He also claimed that public opinion had
                            turned against the Communists there. Finally, “Thanom mentioned the
                            problem of the North Vietnamese refugees in the Northeast. He said there
                            are some 30,000 Vietnamese who could fight against Thailand and said an
                            estimated 12,000 are ‘real Communist.’ When asked if there was evidence
                            to support an active role by the North Vietnamese refugees in the
                            insurgency, Thanom listed several examples of North Vietnamese
                            fund-gathering efforts. Ambassador Unger observed that while there is
                            ample evidence of their fund-gathering activities he was aware of little
                            evidence the Vietnamese refugees are actively engaged in the insurgency

                        “pouring” supplies into the north.</p>
                    <p>5. Dep Asst Secy <persName corresp="#p_HAW2">Hummel</persName> raised the
                        problem of narcotics trafficking and said the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> is interested in cooperating with the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> in suppressing such trafficking. He
                        particularly noted the recent well-publicized burning of 26 tons of opium
                        and said this act has gone a long way in stilling criticisms of Thai
                        efforts. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is sincerely trying to control drug

                            >US</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCM1">Dawee</persName> observed that harsher penalties for

                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said he has received reports
                        suggesting the Red Chinese are actively involved in drug trafficking. Dept
                        Asst Secy <persName corresp="#p_HAW2">Hummel</persName> expressed <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest in receiving any evidence of such
                        involvement, but told <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> that the

                        support this.</p>
                    <p>7. The Amb also specifically raised with <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> the drug problem at International School Bangkok,
                        noting the considerable increase in the use of heroin among students at the
                        school. He mentioned the great concern felt by everyone in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> community over this problem. Amb Unger said
                        that he would act rapidly in all cases which came to his attention and that
                        some people have already been returned to the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said the drugs
                        are being introduced not by young people but the older persons, also citing
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and European “hippies” who travel here
                        as tourists. He said he is considering banning such persons from entering
                        Thailand. The Amb again noted that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        appreciates the help that has been given so far, but said he would like to
                        request special help from the police in cleaning up the sources of these
                        drugs.</p>
                    <p>8. The Amb also told <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> he has

                        had already talked about it with police DG General Prasert.</p>
                    <p>9. Dep Asst Secy <persName corresp="#p_HAW2">Hummel</persName> asked about
                        plans to promulgate a constitution and form a cabinet. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> observed that the problems which had
                        brought about the November 17 coup have not yet been solved. In this regard,
                        he specifically noted the need for governmental reorganization and security.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said the <gloss

                        returning to constitutional rule “so we will not have to have a coup again.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said the governmental
                        reorganization will be the subject of discussion at the <gloss

                        that continuation of these problems does not mean that there will be a wait
                        of “20 years” before returning to constitutional government, but he declined
                        to predict exactly when the change may take place.</p>

                    <p>1. I am profoundly concerned about <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Jack
                            Anderson</persName> “revelations” reported in reftels. Earlier stories
                        based on charges by Congressman Wolff and others have been unfortunate but
                        we have at least been in <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0401"/>a position
                        to present our side of the story as I recently did in a public release with
                        regard to narcotics (Bangkok 6400). While Thai Govt was and continues to be
                        deeply disturbed about press and Congressional accusations and finds it hard
                        to make distinctions between Congress and administration, nevertheless we
                        have managed thus far to avoid serious damage to our working relations.</p>
                    <p>2. New “revelations”, however, appear to be unmistakably attributable to
                        Executive Branch documents or conversations with Executive branch personnel
                        privy to this and other missions' reporting on events and conversations in
                        Thailand. I realize that this should come as no surprise to me since
                        apparently <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Jack Anderson</persName> has access to
                        whatever he wants in Washington today. I hope, however, Department
                        appreciates what impact of coming stories likely to be on our relations here
                        and on our capacity to influence <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> actions
                        and programs and to secure <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> acquiescence
                        or cooperation in programs essential to us.</p>
                    <p>3. I also question whether, given <persName corresp="#p_AJ1"
                            >Anderson</persName>'s motivations and mode of operation, we can afford
                        to seem to be acknowledging “rumors implicating high Thai officials” and to
                        be asking for substantiation. Actually, some months ago I asked all elements
                        of this mission to give high priority to investigating rumors that top Thai
                        leaders were involved in narcotics traffic. No evidence has come to light
                        implicating any one at the <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss> level. We are
                        continuing to collect evidence on lower level<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4"
                            >See <ref target="#d162fn3">Document 162 and footnote 3 thereto.</ref>
                        </note> involvement but even here we lack much firm information.</p>
                    <p>4. I hope Whitten was given facts to put <persName corresp="#p_AJ1"
                            >Anderson</persName> “information” on narcotics in perspective and also
                        effort was made to persuade Whitten that “revelations”, particularly if they
                        seem to be attributable to U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. missions
                        abroad, are virtually certain to jeopardize working relations laboriously
                        developed with <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> and which are only means
                        we have to bring about effective control of narcotics traffic.</p>
                    <p>5. “Revelations” about Phu Kwang, including judgments about Thai performance,

                        reference to internal Mission discussions about B–52s and CS which have been

                        situation and actions are available to the press. It will also convince them
                        that this Mission holds views of such a critical and unfriendly nature that
                        frank and friendly relations characteristic of our past association will be
                        hard, if not impossible, to continue. Consequences of this when we are daily

                    <p>6634. VP Only. For The Vice President From Unger. Subject: Thai-U.S.
                        Relations and Your Visit to Bangkok. This message provides background on
                        current Thai-U.S. relations and, where needed, talking points for use in
                        your discussions with the Thai leadership.</p>
                    <p>1. Vietnam</p>
                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>A. Thai leaders fully support the measures taken by the President to meet the
                        crisis created by the North Vietnamese invasion. They have shown this
                        through public and private statements as well as their readiness to open
                        their bases to our <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> buildup.</p>
                    <p>B. The Thai remain extremely concerned about the current military situation
                        in South Vietnam. They see the future independence of Laos and Cambodia
                        hanging in the balance along with that of South Vietnam. Thus they know
                        their own security will be deeply affected by the outcome of the present
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>C. Thai leaders have readily accommodated our urgent needs for redeployment
                        of U.S. forces to Thailand despite their full realization of the risks
                        involved as public attention progressively shifts from <gloss
                            target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> to Thailand as the major base for U.S.
                        combat activities in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0403"/>
                    <p>They recognize the increased danger of retaliatory attack against Thai bases.
                        The redeployment also has created an increased sense of the U.S. commitment
                        to South Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, including continued air
                        support for the defending forces in Indochina. Further, it has heightened
                        Thai expectations of military and economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>D. Thai realization of their increased exposure will also heighten the
                        bitterness of their reaction if we make concessions at the negotiating table
                        which they regard as inconsistent with their own basic security
                        requirements. They have repeatedly asked to be consulted by us before
                        fundamental changes are made on our negotiating position. These requests
                        have been transmitted to the President. Since the President's speech of May
                        8, they have sought clarification particularly on our stance concerning a
                        ceasefire, i.e. whether we are now prepared to accept continued North
                        Vietnamese presence in Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>E. Talking Point: It would be particularly useful if you could discuss with
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> our negotiating posture in light of
                        the President's offer of May 8 especially clarification of the ceasefire
                        offer. The Thai will also deeply appreciate whatever assessment you feel
                        able to give them of the current military situation in <gloss
                            target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and of our program of severing <gloss
                            target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>'s supply line.</p>
                    <p>2. U.S. Military Deployments to Thailand</p>
                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>A. In 1970–71 we reduced U.S. military forces in Thailand from a peak of
                        48,000 to a U.S./<gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> agreed level of 32,200.
                        Eighty percent of these were <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> units
                        engaged in the air war in Indochina. Major combat units operating from five
                        Thai bases (Utapao, Korat, Udorn, Ubon and Nakhon Phanom) included one
                            <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> wing (B–52's and tankers), eleven
                        tactical fighter squadrons, mainly F–4s, and gunships, as well as support
                        aircraft of many types.</p>
                    <p>B. Recent large <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> deployments associated
                        with developments in Vietnam increased our in-country strength to
                        approximately 40,000 and required the reopening of a sixth base (Takhli)
                        which we previously turned back to the Thai Air Force. In the course of
                        these deployments we added nine B–52's (making a total of 50) and nine F–4
                        squadrons as well as many tankers. Additional aircraft may be moved from
                        Danang to Thailand. This would require a buildup at a new operating location
                        and could add as many as 4,000 additional U.S. personnel to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>C. Talking Point: Express the administration's appreciation for all the Thai
                        have done and are continuing to do in furthering our mutual interests in
                        Indochina. Recognize the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>'s immediate
                        approval of the large U.S. air buildup in Thailand required as a response to
                        increased enemy initiatives throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0404"/>
                    <p>3. U.S. Politics and the U.S. Commitment</p>
                    <p>Talking Point: They will want your appraisal of the current political
                        situation in the United States, both in terms of the Congress and the
                        forthcoming election, and its implications for our continuing ability to
                        carry out a foreign policy of collective security in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>4. U.S. Military Assistance to Thailand</p>
                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>A. U.S. service-funded military assistance to Thailand, including special
                        supplements, have averaged $72 million a year since <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss>–68. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–72 level
                        (provisional) is $83.5 million. This includes a $15 million grant to enable
                        the Thai to improve its counterinsurgency capability in the military
                        services, and be prepared for contingencies. In <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss>–73 military assistance to Thailand will shift from <gloss
                            target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>,
                        funded by security assistance legislation, and thus particularly vulnerable
                        to scrutiny in the Senate and by the <gloss target="#t_SFRC1"
                        >SFRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>B. U.S. military assistance was used in earlier years to equip a general
                        purpose, conventional military force. Force modernization continues to be a
                        program goal. More attention is now being given to developing forces adapted
                        to the carrying out of counterinsurgency operations, including providing
                        relevant equipment such as M–16 rifles and helicopters, and converter sets
                        for gunships.</p>
                    <p>C. Thai leaders have fully endorsed the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine and have accepted the principle that U.S.
                        forces should not become involved in Thailand's security problem. They have
                        been encouraged to expect that the U.S. will continue <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> at or near present levels. In January 1971,
                        Secretary of Defense Laird stated in Bangkok that under the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine the level of U.S. military
                        assistance to Thailand would remain the same or even increase.</p>
                    <p>D. Talking Point: Thai leaders are likely to seek assurances of continued
                        military assistance and may point especially to requirements for
                        helicopters. In responding, you should assure Thais that we will be as
                        responsive as possible to their requirements, but take care not to raise
                        their expectations for specific dollar-levels of <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>. As to specific items, such as helicopters, we will
                        consider these in context of Thai needs and capabilities to operate and
                        support; we do in fact expect to deliver to the <gloss target="#t_RTA1"
                            >RTA</gloss> this calendar year 32 Hueys (UH–IM) and two to the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. Economic Assistance Program</p>
                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>A. U.S. economic aid to Thailand declined steadily from a peak of $54 million
                        in 1967 to $23 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–1971. This
                        fiscal year obligations will total approximately $17 million in aid funds
                        plus $14 million from PL–480. Our program emphasizes support of <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> counterinsurgency activities, but includes
                        assistance aimed at some of <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0405"
                        />Thailand's longer term economic problems, particularly in the agricultural
                        area. The $14 million of PL–480 assistance is the first part of a $30
                        million loan which is aimed at preventing the increased <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> security expenditurs from threatening
                        development programs.</p>
                    <p>B. Talking Point: Thai leaders may ask for assurance on future aid levels.
                        Suggest you respond that the President places great importance on continuing
                        to provide needed assistance to countries which are endeavoring to meet
                        their own development and security needs. We have requested from Congress,
                        and expect to receive, funding that will permit programs in Thailand to
                        continue at the present level.</p>
                    <p>6. Insurgency</p>
                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>A. Communist-directed insurgency in Thailand has continued growing in past
                        year despite increased <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> efforts to deal
                        with it. Number of main force insurgents rose about 20 percent last year to
                        estimated 7,000. There has also been considerable improvement in quantity
                        and quality of their weapons supplied primarily by Chinese through Laos.
                        Most disturbing has been expansion of Communist political infrastructure in
                        villages. Total number of incidents, including those initiated by <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> forces, increased to 3,500 in 1971, up
                        about 50 percent from 1970. In 1971 1,481 Thai officials were killed or
                        seriously wounded fighting the insurgency. This is double the figure for the
                        previous year.</p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has responded by putting more troops
                        into counterinsurgency operations in field along with police and civilian
                        paramilitary forces. It has also increased its defense budget this fiscal
                        year and next by a total of about $20 million as part of a U.S.-Thai
                        cooperative program to improve <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        capability to counter its insurgent threat. Main problem areas, which were
                        highlighted in recent major <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> operations,
                        involve coordination among different organizations engaged in <gloss
                            target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> activity and effective implementation in
                        field of well-conceived <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> plans. Small unit
                        training and leadership leave much to be desired. Our assistance to the
                        police is a major element in our economic aid program.</p>
                    <p>C. Talking Points: Inquire about progress of the insurgency and <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> countermeasures. Encourage Thais to meet
                        insurgency threat now before it becomes more difficult to handle. To any
                        inquiry on assistance levels for Thai police, suggest you respond that you
                        understand police presently have under consideration our proposal for a
                        comprehensive program which reflects our best estimate of what is needed.
                        This provides opportunity for <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> to
                        register desire for helicopters if these are considered to be a priority
                        need. Considering the dangers of a ground attack on U.S. Air Force elements
                        stationed on Thai bases and engaged in the Vietnam War, you may wish to
                        express appreciation for <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> cooperative
                        efforts thus far, and suggest that even greater defensive patrolling and
                        intelligence collection now by Thai civilian, police and military <pb
                            n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0406"/>components would be helpful. (Thai

                    <p>7. Narcotics</p>
                    <p>A. We have made a major effort to improve the suppression effort against the
                        illicit narcotics traffic through Thailand over the past year. The Thai
                        leadership has been forthcoming in statements and actions concerning the
                        problem. We negotiated a memorandum of understanding on the subject in
                        September 1971 and we have under way a number of programs aimed at
                        increasing enforcement capability of the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                        >RTG</gloss>. Our main problem in implementing the programs lies in the fact
                        that the Thai view narcotics as essentially a U.S. problem and that

                    <p>B. Major results thus far include creating a special mobile task force in
                        Northern Thailand, and <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> cooperation in
                        breaking a number of major links in the narcotics traffic. The <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> also acquired (and destroyed) 26 tons of
                        opium from Chinese Irregular Forces (former KMI) in return for offering land
                        on which the Chinese can settle permanently. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> also extracted a promise by the Chinese Irregulars to end
                        their involvement in illicit narcotics traffic, an agreement which the
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will monitor. Although the fact is
                        highly sensitive and not publicized the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> was partially

                    <p>C. Criticism of the Thai narcotics suppression effort such as that voiced by
                        Congressman Lester Wolff, and that presented in the <gloss target="#t_NBC1"
                            >NBC</gloss> television special “The Thai Connection,” is widely
                        publicized here and creates a good deal of resentment. We have explained
                        publicly that we do not agree with those charges and appreciate <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                    <p>D. Talking Point: Express appreciation for Thai cooperation and for their
                        increased efforts to suppress narcotics traffic. At the same time, you
                        should stress to them that only improved performance will really answer the
                        inevitable critics, just as in our handling of the problem in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>8. Laos</p>
                    <p>Background</p>
                    <p>A. For years, Thai military units have played a key role in the defense of
                        Laos, especially Gen. Vang Pao's stronghold at Long Tieng southwest of the
                        Plaine des Jarres. A total of 22 Thai volunteer battalions (funded by the
                        U.S.) are currently committed in Laos. Their support was crucial during the
                        heavy dry season offensive launched by the Communists just before Christmas.
                        Only the combination of Thai volunteer units and U.S. Air Force support
                        (including the B–52's) permitted the friendly forces to survive and hold key
                        positions such as Long Tieng under heavy enemy attacks earlier this year.
                        The intensity of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> focus on the
                        offensive in South Vietnam has eased the situation in Laos.</p>

                    <p>Time: 3:00–4:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Place: National Security Council Headquarters.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia.]</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> referred to Moose–Lowenstein
                        report and its references to Thai volunteers. He asked VP what effect this
                        report would have on Thai/U.S. relations. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>
                        said he was not too worried about this. Today's Senate vote will cool
                        somewhat ardor of dovish elements in Congress. President is firmly committed
                        to a course of action in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and will do
                        whatever necessary to see it through. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> said he concerned because <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> has consistently maintained that, while it trains Lao
                        forces in Thailand, only volunteers from Thailand serve in Lao forces.
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> concerned reports such as this will
                        give impression that <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> forces are or will
                        serve in Laos. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said some elements of the
                        press have behaved irresponsibly but public opinion surge he had described
                        will discredit to some extent this kind of sniping. However, we must not
                        expect a cessation of anti-war activism in U.S.</p>
                    <p>17. On <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>'s invitation to discuss priority
                        matters to be conveyed to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said
                        insurgency situation in North, North-east, and South is worsening. <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is taking measures to suppress insurgency
                        and frustrate enemy's effort to win over the people, but continued U.S.
                        assistance is needed. Dawee said priority needs are <pb n="359"
                            xml:id="pg_359" facs="0408"/>additional communications equipment,
                        helicopters, and wheeled armored vehicles. Often Government forces know
                        where enemy forces are but cannot get to them before they disappear.
                        Government forces often encounter land-mines. More helicopters and armored
                        vehicles would allow <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> forces to do better
                        job and also boost their morale. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> pleased with recent
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> action to suppress insurgency. He
                        would convey request for equipment.</p>
                    <p>18. On narcotics question, <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said
                        Thai are deeply upset that Congressman Wolff is calling Thailand the center
                        of opium trade and belittling its suppression effort. Recent <gloss
                            target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss> T.V. program used picture of Deputy
                        Chairman Prapass to imply he involved in opium traffic. Thais very concerned
                        about this. Drugs destroy lives of Thai youth too, and they wish to
                        eradicate this menace. <persName corresp="#p_WWT1">William A.
                            Wanzeck</persName> and Jack Greene of <gloss target="#t_BNDD1"
                            >BNDD</gloss> being considered for Thai decorations for their role in
                        suppression activities. Allegations that Thais not cooperating completely
                        untrue as record of seizures and destruction of opium show. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked <gloss target="#t_VP1"
                            >VP</gloss> to make statement reassuring U.S. public on Thai effort.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> made several
                        interjections during presentation, obviously intent that <gloss
                            target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> understand seriousness with which Thais view
                        subject. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> fully aware of Thai cooperation in
                        this field, had asked <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> to convey
                        appreciation for efforts of Thai leaders. Some politicians use this kind of
                        attack as personal launching pad, and media sometimes unfortunately support
                        such efforts, as in case of misleading documentary on Thailand. <gloss
                            target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> assured Thais such criticism does not square
                        with prevalent U.S. view of Thailand, personally regretted incident and
                        expressed willingness to state support for Thais on this subject.</p>
                    <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> said Thailand is taking
                        strong actions to eliminate opium traffic. Some of those caught have been
                        executed. <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has program to help hill
                        tribes shift from opium to other crops. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>
                        again gave recognition to Thai efforts, and said he knew Wolff had tried to
                        show that his recent intervention had produced programs which in fact are
                        result of long-standing cooperative effort.</p>
                    <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked <gloss target="#t_VP1"
                            >VP</gloss> to convey to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> hope that President will continue vigorous and
                        determined policies in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> which are so
                        important to morale of small countries making an effort to maintain their
                        independence and freedom. Thailand will continue to defend its independence
                        against communist attack, but needs military assistance in form of equipment
                        from U.S. Enemy is equipped with foreign armaments, and as a developing
                        country Thailand cannot afford equipment needed to match enemy. Thailand
                        wants to avoid being caught short, as was <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                            >GVN</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>'s 130 mm
                        artillery.</p>
                    <p>21. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> promised to convey this message to
                        President, added he will get information from Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> to help refute false <pb n="360"
                            xml:id="pg_360" facs="0409"/>charges concerning narcotics. <gloss
                            target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> expressed thanks to Thais for speaking
                        frankly on all issues as friends can and should do.</p>
                    <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> again thanked <gloss
                            target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> for visit, and President, <gloss

                            >Rogers</persName> for their understanding of Thai problems. He hoped
                        President will appreciate that Thailand asks for assistance only because it
                        truly and urgently needed. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> agreed to
                        convey this message, said U.S. has no more dependable friend in Asia than

                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Let's turn now to the
                        problem of putting more B–52s into Thailand. We all realize this is a big
                        problem.</p>
                    <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0410"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Yes, it is. I would like to have a good
                        discussion of it here today. Tom [<persName corresp="#p_MTH1"

                    </p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: The first thing to consider is the physical
                        problem— just getting space for the planes. Then we have the problem of the
                        political approach to the Thai. We've been nibbling away at the Thai on a
                        piecemeal basis. <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> feels, and
                        rightly so, I think, that when he makes his next approach to them, they will
                        ask us what our plans are. They will want to know how much more we plan to
                        send to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>Also, <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> feels the Thai will want
                        to have some sort of a discussion about our strategy and our thoughts for
                        the future concerning Southeast Asia. As you know, we have not given
                        anything along this line to <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> to
                        pass on to the Thai.</p>
                    <p>On the physical side, we have had quite a few exchanges. Another cable came
                        in from Len [<persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>]<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d166fn4">Brackets in the source text.</note> this morning. The
                        major question is how many more B–52s—if any—have to go to U Tapao? All
                        other questions, it seems to me, flow from that.</p>
                    <p>Concerning personnel, we are fast approaching the point where we may have as
                        many, if not more, people in Thailand than in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: And bear in mind, too,
                        that we will have to start moving out of Danang if we want to withdraw the
                        196th Brigade— and meet the 49,000 ceiling.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: To the degree that it appears to the Thai
                        that we are choking their facilities in order to maintain the Vietnam
                        ceiling, they will not be receptive. This is a major problem which we have
                        to face up to.</p>
                    <p>When we go back to <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>, I would like
                        to have a full package for him, together with a rationale which he can
                        present to the Thai. I've done the first draft of such a message, I think we
                        should all take a look at it. If <persName corresp="#p_ULS1"
                            >Unger</persName> can go to the Thai with this kind of a package and a
                        rationale, he will be able to make an effective approach. If we keep going
                        in piecemeal, though, the Thai will probably get their backs up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">Rush</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: The approach I outlined is what we have in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName> says: “In my judgment, we are
                        reaching the point where the tactical advantages of securing additional
                        temporary <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0411"/>aircraft accommodations
                        in Thailand will be clearly outweighed by political liabilities of pushing
                        the Thai too far. Accordingly, we must establish some clear limits beyond
                        which we will not go in our deployment requests.”</p>
                    <p>When we move out of Danang, we will put even more aircraft into Thailand.
                        We've already started preparing Nam Phong for the Marines.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I was speaking to Bangkok on the telephone
                        earlier today, and I was told that the Thai don't want any public statement
                        about the opening of Nam Phong.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: That's all right.
                        Incidentally, when the F–4s go there, we will need more tankers for them
                        because they will have greater distances to fly. This is entirely separate
                        from the B–52 problem, too.</p>
                    <p>While we're speaking about problems, I might mention the bomb problem. Quite
                        naturally, our bomb expenditure has greatly increased as the B–52 force has
                        been augmented. If we send more planes, the expenditure will obviously go up
                        even more, too. In order to solve this problem, we must surge with bomb
                        production. With 235 B–52s and all the Tac Air we have out there, we could
                        very easily run out of bombs. We are dropping the bombs faster than we make
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">Rush</persName>: What about our worldwide
                        inventory? Can we take some bombs from that?</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: We are already drawing
                        down the European inventory. However, if we step up production, we should be
                        able to stop the drawdown and hold our own by January. The forthcoming rainy
                        season in Vietnam will have some effect in cutting down the bomb expenditure
                        because the planes won't be able to fly as many missions as they are flying
                        now. Still, we have to take some drastic actions with regard to bomb
                        production. The B–52s pour out the bombs by the hundreds of thousands of
                        tons.</p>
                    <p>The first question that has to be decided is whether the President wants to
                        add thirty-four more B–52s—to get the one hundred he recently ordered?<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">According to the minutes of the May 30 <gloss

                        additional B–52s?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: I wouldn't worry about the
                        President being wed to the figure of one hundred additional B–52s. He wanted
                        a dramatic step-up in the number of B–52s, and we have done that.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: If he will be satisfied
                        with the sixty-six B–52s, the only problem we will have is getting the
                        additional tankers in Thailand.<note n="6" xml:id="d166fn6">According to the

                            Tapao, 20 for Takhli, and 13 for Don Muang, “most of which are already
                            in place.” (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>These tankers will be needed for the F–4s coming out of Danang, and I think
                        we can arrange it with the Thai. They have already agreed to the transfer of
                        the Marine F–4s from Danang.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: The Thai have also agreed to the reopening
                        of Takhli, but they have not agreed about Korat.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: We plan to leave one
                        alert squadron in Danang because we feel we can accept the hazard of keeping
                        one squadron there after the 196th Brigade leaves. Abe, as you know, wants
                        to pull the brigade out in order to get down to the 49,000 ceiling.</p>
                    <p>If the President wants the one hundred additional B–52s—that means
                        thirty-four more than we are planning to send right now—we will have a big
                        problem. We will have to force the Thai into agreeing that the tankers now
                        at <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Tapao should be moved to Don Muang.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: It will mean in effect that we have taken
                        over Don Muang. We would have to close the second runway on the military
                        side of the field and use it for parking space. And if we put forty-six
                        KC–135 tankers into Don Muang, that will displace the Thai Air Force units
                        there. As I said, we will have taken over Bangkok International Airport.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: We probably could lay a
                        few more mats at Takhli and accommodate some more planes there. But that
                        really isn't the solution. We've also looked at the possibility of
                        stationing the tankers at Clark Field. Because of the greater distances
                        involved, though, you have to put two and a half tankers into the
                        Philippines for every tanker you take out of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>
                        Tapao.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: It's clear that we should
                        drop the option of putting more B–52s into Thailand unless we undertake
                        crash construction projects on facilities we hold, rather than on facilities
                        the Thai hold.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I agree. Can we proceed on that
                        assumption?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: That's my feeling. But we
                        have to give all the options to the President and await his guidance.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: We can start some
                        construction work at U Tapao, but that will, of course, take some time.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: Concerning the political
                        problem of putting more B–52s in Thailand, the President isn't aware of the
                        strain this move will have on the political fabric tieing us to the Thai.
                        And only a handful of B–52s is involved.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: I don't think it's
                        worthwhile to court political trouble by asking the Thai to accept more
                        B–52s. These planes can only carry twenty-six bombs, anyway. We already have
                        over 200 B–52s in the theater—more than we've ever had out there before. In
                        my judgment, we have an adequate number of B–52s in action right now. But if
                        the President wants to send more, we will do it.</p>
                    <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0413"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Perhaps we can delay the redeployment of
                        some units from Vietnam to Thailand, thus saving some space at Takli and
                        Korat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">Rush</persName>: If we do that, it will
                        certainly have an effect on the 49,000 ceiling.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I know. Remember, though, that the
                        President has always said he will make the necessary decisions based on the
                        circumstances at the moment. If he has to maintain the ceiling, he will do
                        it. Still, we can give him some options—such as deferring the redeployments
                        and, thereby, saving space in Thailand.</p>
                    <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: We have to get an answer
                        to the basic question. Are sixty-six additional B–52s enough to meet the
                        President's requirement? In three weeks, we will have sent sixty-six more
                        B–52s to Guam. If this is enough to meet his requirement, then we can deal
                        with the Thai on the basis of arranging only the redeployments from Danang.
                        However, if it does not meet his requirement, and if he wants us to send
                        another thirty-four B–52s, then we will have a great problem with the
                        Thai.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>: As I said before, I don't
                        think the President is wed to the figure of one hundred more B–52s. He
                        wanted us to take drastic action, which we did.</p>

                            >FM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> asked Vice President for
                        increased military assistance to Thailand, specifying helicopters, armored
                        cars, and communications equipment. In response to call to <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> from Vice President's office, <gloss
                            target="#t_MACTHAI1">MACTHAI</gloss> has been instructed through
                        military channels to develop recommended package <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365"
                            facs="0414"/>of defense equipment of approximately $15 million which
                        might be given to Thais as special military assistance add-on. We feel this
                        is opportunity to present constructive package which we have structure in
                        four parts to be responsive to Marshal Thanom's specific requests as well as
                        re-oriented high priority requirements and which we would relate to
                        increased Thai performance in Thai security and counter insurgency programs.
                        End summary.</p>
                    <p>1. In context of Field Marshal Thanom's request for more military equipment
                        for Thailand to Vice President, during <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>'s
                        recent visit to Thailand (see reftels), on May 24 <gloss
                            target="#t_MACTHAI1">MACTHAI</gloss> received telephone request from
                            <gloss target="#t_OSDISA1">OSD/ISA</gloss> through <gloss
                            target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to suggest items that might be
                        provided to Thailand under military assistance if special add-on fund of $15
                        million were to become available. <gloss target="#t_OSDISA1">OSD/ISA</gloss>
                        stated request in response to inquiry from Vice President's office.</p>
                    <p>2. In follow-up to Vice President's discussions with Thai leaders, including
                        Ambassador's meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DCM1">Marshal
                            Dawee</persName> today, Mission has attempted obtain clearer idea what
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> had in mind when he asked
                        for additional helicopters, communication equipment, and wheeled armored
                        vehicles (para 17, ref a). We conclude from three separate conversations
                        with <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> Chief of Staff, General Surakij,
                        during past week that <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> wanted
                        more helicopters (than Thais know are already in pipeline) delivered more
                        quickly than projected delivery schedule. <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName> wants helicopters to fill out two existing <gloss
                            target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> airmobile (helicopter) companies and to
                        equip a planned third airmobile company. Although Surakij does not think
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> sought helicopters for
                            <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>, need for more helicopters
                        (including helicopters for <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> and police)
                        has been recurring theme in conversations with Thai leaders, from King on
                        down.</p>
                    <p>While helicopter program recommended below should meet those needs if
                        properly managed we will keep this question under study. We have invited
                        Thai to explain needs as they see them but have also pointed to large <gloss
                            target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss> helicopter program over past few years
                        and to management difficulties, including pilot shortage, which could arise
                        by overloading. Regarding request for armored cars, Surakij felt a few such
                        vehicles for <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> to evaluate new types would
                        meet the requirements. He also addressed some <gloss target="#t_RTA1"
                            >RTA</gloss> communication equipment needs, which are discussed further
                        below.</p>
                    <p>3. In course of normal <gloss target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss>/<gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> dialogue before Vice President's visit,
                        there have been several lower level <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        approaches regarding increased military assistance support to Thailand both
                        for additional items of equipment and for increased level of support.
                        Mission officers have responded to these requests by pointing out that
                        military assistance funds are limited (and probably will continue to be),
                        that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will do its best to assist Thais to
                        meet their priority needs within these limits, and that mission will study
                        each request very carefully.</p>
                    <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0415"/>
                    <p>4. Additional military assistance to Thailand would offer excellent
                        opportunity to develop constructive supplemental program to meet real Thai
                        needs. Add-on package could provide further incentive to move Thais to
                        improve their own response to counterinsurgency. We feel assistance beyond
                        basic program level should be negotiated with Thais in conjunction with
                        actions which we feel Thais should take to increase effectiveness of their
                        security and counterinsurgency programs (as in recent <gloss
                            target="#t_AAT1">AAT</gloss>/Ramasoon exercise, but less formally,
                        considering short time available in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72).
                        Although we believe that we should be responsive to each of <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>'s requests, pertinence to
                        counterinsurgency including support for VDC and hill tribe volunteers should
                        be a prime test of priority in expenditures for equipment in overall
                        contemplated <gloss target="#t_MASF1">MASF</gloss> add-on.</p>
                    <p>5. Mission has prepared a list of items which might be included in add-on,
                        grouped by category without any priority having been assigned. We consider
                        list, which follows as most desirable make-up of program for presentation to
                        Vice President. This list of items recommended for possible add-on is
                        necessarily tentative pending our submission of more final mission
                        recommendations based upon further study and exploration of Thai
                        desires.</p>

                        Thailand, which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> and I
                        agree should not be done.</p>
                    <p>—Speed up delivery of half the 1,000 tactical radios now in the Thai program
                        for arrival in March 1973. They could be delivered in August by a temporary
                        diversion from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> of 500 radios (from the
                        planned <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> delivery of 2,000) for about two
                        weeks and brief adjustments in delivery times of other programs.</p>
                    <p>Thailand will be transferred from Service funding to MAP on 1 July 1972, and
                        MAP funds are severely limited. Therefore, if we are to provide a special
                        package to the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>, the decision should be
                        made immediately so that Service funds may be obligated before 1 July.
                        Proceeding now with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s
                        package would serve two purposes:</p>
                    <p>—It would demonstrate our responsiveness to the Thai request and evidence a
                        forthcoming attitude in view of all they have done for us during our force
                        buildup.</p>
                    <p>—It will provide a hedge against possible MAP cuts next year.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you approve Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"

                    <p>Secto 93. 1. June 28 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                        met with Thai <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Council Member Pote
                        Sarasin to review several points in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Thai
                        relations as well as bearing on developments in Southeast Asia of summit
                        talks and subsequent <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> contacts with <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                        >PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> thanked the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> for their prompt and generous assistance in
                        accommodating <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces required for the
                        increased air activities in North and South Vietnam. Pote said Thailand
                        regarded this as fulfilling its obligations under SEATO. He noted that in so
                        doing Thailand encouraged considerable criticism from neutral countries and
                        made it more vulnerable to communist hostility, as was evident from increase
                        in insurgency.</p>
                    <p>3. Because of this increase the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> had asked
                        Vice President <persName corresp="#p_AST1">Agnew</persName> for additional
                        assistance, a reply to which Pote said had been received promptly and in the
                        affirmative. With the growing threat, the Thais were concerned about their
                        arms and equipment being inferior to the enemy and he asked about continuing
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance; he expressed particular
                        concern about the Wolff amendment on narcotics which would cut off all aid.
                        Secretary said he could understand the Thai concern on these matters but
                        explained that these were manifestations of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> politics particularly in an election year and he said he
                        expected that we would be able to help with what was essential.</p>
                    <p>4. Pote then referred to the summit meetings and subsequent contacts in
                        Peking and Hanoi and said that Marshal Thanom, <gloss target="#t_NEC1"
                            >NEC</gloss> Chairman, <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0418"/>had
                        instructed him to ask the Secretary on a very confidential basis what
                        bearing those conversations had had on the situation in Southeast Asia
                        including an end to the Vietnam war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName> explained to Pote that in spite of the lengthy
                        conversations there was not very much of a specific nature that could be
                        cited although we do believe as a result of the talks that both the Russians
                        and Chinese doubt the wisdom of an extended continuation of the war in
                        Vietnam. After some further discussion on this point the Secretary made
                        clear that we have left neither Moscow nor Peking in any doubt about our
                        taking very seriously our continuing commitment to our allies and <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, which of course means above all our
                        commitment to Thailand. We have felt that neither the Soviets nor the
                        Chinese challenge this.</p>
                    <p>5. Pote volunteered that the Thais have been urging their neighbors to accept
                        the expanding role of the Japanese in Southeast Asia even while carefully
                        looking out for their own interests; he felt this was important in order not
                        to drive Japan back into a militaristic frame of mind. He also volunteered
                        that the Thai leaders will be forming a new, constitutional government quite
                        soon, attributing the delay to some lack of decision on the part of Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> and their desire to have
                        thoroughly worked out beforehand the framework for future administration.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said we well
                        understood the Thai situation. He also referred to narcotics control,
                        thanking the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> for its close cooperation
                        and urging them to do anything more that they can. Finally, he acknowledged
                        the crucial role of the Thai volunteers in the defense of Laos over the
                        recent dry season.</p>

                            xml:id="d170fn2">Not found.</note> was most informative and reassuring
                        about the Thai volunteer program and <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>
                        intentions for the program. I agree that recruitment should be emphasized in
                        order to bring deployed forces and replacement units up to full strength and
                        keep them at that level. Additionally, the deployment plans voiced by
                        General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> accord with our
                        view, although the priorities among the areas mentioned by General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PCPC1">Praphat</persName> are not clear. Of greatest
                        interest as a potential problem area, however, were the comments on
                        equipping the volunteers and sustaining them outside Laos temporarily should
                        a ceasefire occur.</p>
                    <p>As you know, assistance to the Thai volunteers has been provided under the
                        authority which permits military department appropriations to be utilized
                        for military assistance to Vietnam and Laos. We have argued that the Thai
                        volunteers are “local forces in Laos” as the words are used in the Defense
                        Procurement Act. With assistance to Thailand now in the Military Assistance
                        Program, the opportunity to mingle assistance to Laos and Thailand is
                        further reduced. The points I wish to make are that:</p>
                    <p>—Equipment provided to the Thai volunteers is provided for the purpose of
                        assisting Laos. This equipment may not be transferred by Laos to other
                        governments or to persons not its officers or agents without <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> consent. This consent must be reported to
                        Congress 15 days before given under Section 502, <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 91–441.</p>
                    <p>—Authority does not now exist to assist Thailand with military equipment
                        other than by <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. —Under circumstances of
                        ceasefire, it is doubtful that maintenance of the volunteer force in
                        Thailand could be justified as assistance to Laos. Further, unless the
                        forces under redeployment to Thailand were either part of the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> or under control of Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, they would not be eligible for support
                        under Thai <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>These constraints should be considered in our dealings with the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> concerning the volunteer program. In
                        particular, a review of the above assistance problems—especially the effect
                        on Laos-related projects of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funding for
                        assistance to Thailand—should be dispatched to the Embassies in Bangkok and
                        Vientiane to apprise them of the situation.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the comments by General <persName corresp="#p_PCPC1"
                            >Praphat</persName> about the build-up to 36 volunteer battalions,
                        together with the recent surge in recruitment, indicate that the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is making a determined movement toward the
                            <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0420"/>36 battalion objective. I wish
                        in this connection to draw attention to the agreed criteria that battalions
                        should be deployed at 100% of authorized strength and maintained at a
                        minimum of 80% of authorized strength. These criteria have not been met.
                        Before supporting added units beyond the existing 25 numbered battalions, we
                        should assure that these manning criteria are met. In pursuit of this goal I
                        am directing <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to provide support
                        appropriate for additional battalions when new battalions are at 100%
                        strength and all existing deployed units are at 80% strength. I hope you
                        will agree that this action is appropriate to provide field activities with

                            Thai Government, “sourced for the most part to persons of unknown
                            reliability and undetermined access.” It concluded that “none of the
                            reports contain sufficient substance to lead us seriously to consider
                            holding up the final payment,” but promised to “continue to monitor
                            situation most closely.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG1"
                                >RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1970–73, DEF 9–5 CHINAT)</note>
                        <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0422"/>The average family is allocated 15
                        rai (2.53 rai equals 1 acre) for its personal use (although ownership is not
                        formally turned over to them). A total of approximately 5,000 individuals
                        are involved.</p>
                    <p>2. In many cases, the families have been living for some time as squatters in
                        villages in the area in which they have now been given refugee status and
                        allocations of land. In these cases, the allocated land has quickly been put
                        to use for crops and livestock. Several new areas are also being opened up.
                        For example, 200 families are scheduled to be resettled in new areas of
                        Chiang Rai Province (areas previously dominated by Communist insurgents). A
                        number of settlers at these two sites are at work building houses and
                        clearing land. Schools to be staffed by Thai teachers are being erected.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to land allocated to families, the Government also intends to
                        set aside large tracts as common land to be used for the economic good of
                        the community as a whole.</p>
                    <p>4. From the economic point of view, the project is viewed as falling into two
                        parts, one aimed at producing the quickest cash return and the second aimed
                        at putting the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> on a permanently viable
                        economic basis.</p>
                    <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has asked for assistance from
                        Taipei in high elevation horticulture to assist in the rapid development of
                        cash crops. Experimentation and research areas are being set aside to help
                        determine which crops are most suitable. The longer term economic base is to
                        be founded on production of tea, cattle, mining, fruit, and vegetable
                        seeds.</p>
                    <p>6. Some setbacks have been encountered in tea cultivation. Only 50 percent of
                        the 450,000 plants already set out have survived. The Government has hired
                        tea propagation experts from Taiwan to advise the settlers and has ordered
                        new and better cuttings to replace the plants that died. It will be five
                        years before the plants will have matured and start producing. The
                        Government will provide a tea processing plant capable of producing 2,000
                        kilograms of tea per day, with this level of production to be achieved
                        within ten years.</p>
                    <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> have approximately 600 head of
                        brahman cattle from Burma, and they plan to double the size of their herds
                        within one year by additional purchases. The Government is providing grass
                        seed more suitable for cattle raising and will train additional <gloss
                            target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> in the technique of artificial
                        insemination. Eight are already qualified but more are needed. The <gloss
                            target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> hope to be able to export cattle by the end
                        of this year.</p>
                    <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0423"/>
                    <p>8. Antimony mining is scheduled to begin this year at Mae Salong in Chiang
                        Rai. The Department of Mines is surveying the region to determine the best
                        location for extracting the antimony. The Department of Mines must also give
                        final approval before actual work can get underway.</p>
                    <p>9. General <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> estimates that the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> will be fully self-sufficient within
                        two years.</p>
                    <p>10. The mobile development units in the area are training <gloss
                            target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> personnel as mechanics to repair and
                        maintain equipment which is being provided for use in agriculture in the
                        common areas. Twelve mechanics from each group are to be trained initially.
                        The mobile development units are also building roads in some of the newly
                        opened areas.</p>
                    <p>11. At the present time, the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> have been
                        given refugee status under Thai law. If this program works out as planned,
                        the Government plans to change their status progressively from refugees to
                        temporary residents, to permanent residents, and finally to Thai
                        nationals.</p>
                    <p>12. General <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName> told us this week
                        that, with the insurgency problem somewhat quieter in Chiang Rai Province,
                        the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> expects to be able to devote more
                        time and resources to the resettlement project. This will entail full time
                        assignment of one or two <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> officers to
                        each of the settlement areas (which are now visited periodically). This will
                        not only speed successful resettlement, but will also enhance the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>'s capability to enforce the agreement to
                        stay out of opium trafficking.</p>
                    <p>13. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has expended a total of $733,000
                        in support of its program to resettle the <gloss target="#t_CIF1"
                            >CIF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>14. I believe the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>'s performance in
                        resettling the <gloss target="#t_CIF1">CIF</gloss> constitutes a
                        satisfactory execution of their commitment to us. They have carried forward
                        the types of programs upon which we and they have agreed, they have expended
                        more than $700,000 of their own funds, and progress to date has been
                        encouraging. I believe the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has also
                        investigated seriously the allegations we have passed to them that Li and
                        Tuan are not abiding by their commitment to get out of the opium trade. In a
                        discussion with Brady and Boyer from the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                        within the past few days, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kriangsak</persName>
                        reaffirmed his government's determination to hold Li and Tuan to their
                        promise. While a number of allegations against them have been made, none of
                        these contains sufficient substance to warrant withholding our final
                        payment. Basic situation remains as described reftel. I, therefore, plan to
                        go ahead with final payment on September 6.</p>

                    <p>The President has indicated his concern over the expanding insurgent threat
                        to effective government control in a number of provinces in rural Thailand,
                        particularly in the two areas bordering Laos in North and Northeast
                        Thailand.</p>
                    <p>The President has requested a study addressing the following two issues:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> actions to increase its
                            counterinsurgency effectiveness</hi>. The repeated demonstrations of
                        insurgent capability to thwart government efforts to counter the insurgent
                        threat warrants an examination of alternative Thai programs and modes of
                        operation which hold out the prospect of increased government effectiveness.
                        The feasibility of such alternatives should be considered in the light of
                        their impact on the balances within the Thai bureaucracy and their resource
                        costs to the Thai government.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">The U.S. role in promoting a more effective Thai
                            counterinsurgency effort</hi>. With limited security assistance
                        resources and an uncertain ability to leverage even marginal changes in Thai
                        direction, our assistance must be carefully organized and directed to ensure
                        support for Thai actions which most effectively contribute to their
                        counterinsurgency effort. Alternative adjustments in the U.S.
                        counterinsurgency assistance program in terms of the allocation of our
                        resources to various Thai programs and in our own management organization at
                        all levels should be considered. The implications for <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> counterinsurgency efforts of either phasing
                        out our counterinsurgency assistance or attempting to exert greater
                        influence with increased levels of assistance should be assessed.</p>

                    <p>This study should draw on work already done in connection with the study

                    </list>
                    <p>During <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972, a number of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-supported Thai volunteer units provided
                        valuable assistance in resisting the North Vietnamese dry season offensive
                        in Laos. By June, 22 such battalions had been deployed in Laos. However,
                        these units were manned at only 59 percent of their authorized strength, in
                        violation of the Thai agreement to maintain deployed units at a minimum
                        strength of 80 percent.</p>
                    <p>During the past three months, exceptional recruiting efforts have taken place
                        in Thailand. The Thai volunteer force has expanded from 9,000 to over 19,000
                        men during this time, and three additional battalions have been formed.</p>
                    <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0426"/>
                    <p>On 28 August 1972, Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_ULS1">Unger</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_GGMM1">Godley</persName> jointly requested that
                        the number of Thai volunteer units be increased from 25 to 30 battalions.
                        This would represent an increase in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973
                        expenditures of at least $16 million. Interagency plans envisage a maximum
                        force of 36 battalions at a cost of $134 million per year. The 30 battalions
                        requested by the Ambassadors would cost $126 million.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that your 8 August 1972 letters to Chairmen Hebert and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJC2">Stennis</persName>, as well as Department of
                        Defense representations to the conferees, were all aimed at eliminating any
                        ceiling on Laos expenditures. These efforts were successful <hi
                            rend="italic">only</hi> in raising the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1973 ceiling level from $350 million to $375 million. This ceiling is on
                        total <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance to Laos for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973 and includes Defense, <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                        funding. We will incur at least a $55 million overrun if spending continues
                        at the planned rate.</p>
                    <p>In view of this new ceiling, we have tried repeatedly to get interagency
                        agreement to scale down the Laos program to get within the $375 million
                        limitation. We have not been successful.</p>
                    <p>I view this new legislative ceiling as a serious matter and will assure that
                        Defense operations are carried out at a level consistent with the $375
                        million limit. As a first step, unless you direct otherwise, I am issuing
                        orders which will prevent expansion of the Thai volunteer force beyond the
                        present 25 battalions—at least until fiscal pressures abate.</p>

                        ceiling.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> in a memo to the
                        President dated September 16 (Tab A)<note n="3" xml:id="d176fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d175">Document 175</ref>.</note> expressed concern that we
                        could not live with the $375 million ceiling for Laos unless programs were
                        tightly controlled. To this end he intends to limit the Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> program to 25 battalions unless the
                        President directs otherwise.</p>
                    <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> will argue that we cannot
                        live within the ceiling unless the Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss>
                        program is held at 25 battalions; the Thai are not all that good or
                        necessary; and the threat of <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> activity is
                        less this year than last.</p>
                    <p>—The Thai have done a creditable job, particularly in North Laos. The <gloss
                            target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> are west of the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1"
                            >PDJ</gloss> and on the Bolovens this year giving them a head start for
                        their dry-season push. The Lao forces are weaker now and we will probably
                        need all the Thai forces we can get to hold this year.</p>
                    <p>—Early estimates suggest that total expenditures with 30 Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions would be about $409 million—$34
                        million over the ceiling (less than 10%). The significant effects of weather
                        alone on levels of combat and thus on consumption of weapons, ammunition,
                        and air support can result in significant variation from early estimates as
                        our experience of the past two years has shown. Thus it is simply too early
                        to assume that we will be significantly over the ceiling.</p>
                    <p>The Thai have finally produced recruits for the training program enabling us
                        to man the existing 22 battalions at 80% strength, deploy an additional 3
                        battalions at full strength, and still permit us to move toward forming an
                        additional 5 battalions. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>] is geared up to get the training done and the
                        battalions deployed. To cut back the program now could cause problems in our
                        relations with the Thai, and deny us needed forces in the face of an
                        uncertain <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> capability and intention for
                        the coming dry season.</p>
                    <p>The Senate committee in reporting out the Defense Procurement Authorization
                        Bill stated: “It is possible that adjustments will be required in the
                        ceiling, depending on future events. Nevertheless, the committee believes a
                        limitation should again be imposed to continue activities in Laos at
                        approximately their present level.”</p>
                    <p>Thus we believe we should not foreclose, now, the possibility of going to the
                        30 battalion level. Meanwhile, we should caution <persName
                            corresp="#p_GGMM1">Godley</persName> to keep a careful watch on
                        expenditures as the situation develops over the next few months. We are
                        continuing our efforts to refine our estimates, identify trade-offs and
                        determine more precisely the effects of the ceiling on essential operations.
                        If it appears by January that we have <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379"
                            facs="0428"/>no alternative we should then be prepared to request an
                        increase in the ceiling. Meanwhile, we should not impose artificial
                        restrictions which may have the effect of giving the <gloss target="#t_NVA1"
                            >NVA</gloss> the victory in Laos we have thus far denied them.</p>

                        if that means a request for a ceiling increase later, we will have to

                    </list>
                    <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, Mr. Boonchu asked Under Secretary
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> about his reaction to Thailand's sending a
                        ping pong team to China. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said that
                        he agreed that communication should be established with Peking and he had no
                        problem with that.</p>
                    <p>Boonchu evinced considerable interest in Ambassador
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>'s views on the security situation in
                        Southeast Asia. He asked about the Viet-Nam negotiations and was told there
                        has been no break-through. He inquired whether Thailand could survive if its
                        neighbors were taken over. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> said yes,
                        if Thailand's resistance was not just military but also political and
                        economic. He noted his concern that <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0429"
                        />every year, since 1965, it was reported that the <gloss target="#t_RTG1"
                            >RTG</gloss> was doing better in its counterinsurgency efforts, yet
                        every year there were more insurgents. Boonchu said that the news in the
                        papers wasn't necessarily the same as the facts. He did not think the
                        insurgency had gained stronger support or that it was gaining recruits. To
                        Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>'s inquiry whether Boonchu was
                        referring to the north or northeast, Boonchu said the problem in the north
                        was military; it appeared that he meant the northeast as the area where
                        there was not much new recruiting. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        noted that Operation Phu Kwang (note—in the tri-province area, Jan–April
                        1972) wasn't very well done. Boonchu attributed this to lack of experience
                        on the part of the forces involved.</p>
                    <p>The Thai visitor then made a pitch for continued <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> material assistance to Thailand. Ambassador
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> replied “you have plenty of military
                        supplies.” He emphasized the importance of police, that the only <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> official that the average up-country Thai
                        sees is a policeman. If he has his hand out for bribes, it is easy to tell
                        what the peasant's reaction to the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is
                        likely to be.</p>
                    <p>Boonchu said military operations are expensive and the <gloss
                            target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> is now increasing its military expenditures
                        at the expense of development. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> noted
                        that it was not just a question of giving the Thai Government aircraft. At
                        least as important was maintenance, up-keep and operations. It was not good
                        for Thailand to depend too much on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
                        However, Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> concluded, we have been
                        helping Thailand and we will continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> expressed his pleasure that Anand had
                        become Thai Ambassador here. He described him as “first class”. In response
                        to an inquiry, Boonchu noted, laughingly, that Thanat was now engaged
                        primarily in playing golf.</p>

                                175</ref>.</note> expressing views about his intention to live
                        within the $375 million Lao ceiling and specifically about his concern that
                        U.S. support of the Thai volunteer battalions, beyond the present 25, will
                        put us over the $375 million limitation. He mentions that the Thai
                        volunteers provided valuable assistance in resisting the North Vietnamese
                        dry season offensive in Laos, even though they were under their authorized
                        strength, and that the Thai Government is now bringing these 25 battalions
                        up to strength. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                        states, nevertheless, that we will incur a substantive overrun if assistance
                        to Laos for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–1973 continues at the present
                        rate, and as a first step, unless you direct otherwise, he proposes
                        preventing the expansion of the Thai volunteer force beyond the present 25
                        battalions—at least until fiscal pressure abates.</p>
                    <p>Although I fully agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                            >Laird</persName> that we must do all possible to live within the Laos
                        ceiling, I feel our first priority must be to make available whatever is
                        needed to defend Laos.</p>
                    <p>The Thai have done a creditable job, particularly in North Laos. The <gloss
                            target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> are west of the Plaine des Jarres and on
                        the Bolovens Plateau this year giving them a head start for a dry-season
                        push if they want to mount one. The Lao forces, particularly <persName
                            corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>'s irregulars, are weaker than in
                        previous years. Thus we will probably need all the Thai forces we can get to
                        hold this year.</p>
                    <p>Early estimates suggest that total expenditures with 30 Thai <gloss
                            target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions would be about $410 to 415
                        million—$35 to 40 million over the ceiling (about 10%). The effects of
                        weather alone on levels of combat and thus on consumption of weapons,
                        ammunition, and air support can result in significant variation from early
                        estimates as our experience of the past two years has shown. Thus it is
                        simply too early to assume that we will be significantly over the
                        ceiling.</p>
                    <p>The Thai have finally produced recruits for the training program enabling us
                        to man the existing 22 battalions already in the field at over <pb n="382"
                            xml:id="pg_382" facs="0431"/>80% strength, fill three new full strength
                        battalions, and still permit us to move toward forming an additional 5
                        battalions. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] is geared up to get the training done and the
                        battalions deployed. To cut back the program now could cause problems in our
                        relations with the Thai, who have expected us to move gradually to support
                        of up to 36 <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions and deny us
                        needed forces in the face of an uncertain <gloss target="#t_NVA1"
                            >NVA</gloss> capabilities and intentions for the coming dry season.</p>
                    <p>The Senate committee in reporting out the Defense Procurement Authorization
                        Bill stated “It is possible that adjustments will be required in the
                        ceiling, depending on future events. Nevertheless, the committee believes a
                        limitation should again be imposed to continue activities in Laos at
                        approximately their present level.”</p>
                    <p>Thus we believe we should not foreclose, now, the possibility of going to the
                        30 battalion level. Meanwhile, we should caution Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GGMM1">Godley</persName> to keep a careful watch on
                        expenditures as the situation develops over the next few months. We are
                        continuing our efforts to refine our estimates, identify trade-offs and
                        determine more precisely the effects of the ceiling on essential operations.
                        If it appears by January that we have no alternative we should then be
                        prepared to request an increase in the ceiling. Meanwhile, we should not
                        impose artificial restrictions which may have the effect of giving the
                            <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> the victory in Laos we have thus far
                        denied them.</p>

                    <p>I appreciate your efforts, as expressed in your memorandum of 16 September,
                        to find ways to conduct our programs in Laos within the $375 million <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–1973 ceiling set by Congress. I certainly
                        share your view that we must treat this ceiling as a serious matter.</p>
                    <p>However, I am convinced that we cannot forego undertaking any reasonable
                        steps to make certain that Laos is well prepared and able to meet the
                        possible enemy threat against Laos in the coming months. Therefore, I
                        request that you do not foreclose now the possibility of moving to support
                        30 Thai <gloss target="#t_SGU1">SGU</gloss> battalions once the existing

                    <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> about the Thai
                        contact with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Pote said they had had
                        to refuse the initial invitation to China which, in any case, was
                        non-governmental, because Thailand was not a member (note: of the Asian
                        Table Tennis Union). A few days later word came that Thailand had been made
                        a member and so it was decided to send a team. <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                            >Prasit Kanchanawat</persName>, whom <persName corresp="#p_PS5"
                            >Pote</persName> described as “my deputy”, was sent with the team. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Prasit</persName> arrived the Chinese took
                        special care of him, e.g., separate accommodations. His midnight meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> was without any
                        forewarning as to the personage involved. It was a correct and formal
                        meeting. Chou sent best regards to His Majesty the King and Field Marshal
                        Thanom. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> noted as interesting one
                        item that <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> mentioned, that the
                        Thai must be very careful about Russian interest in the Kra Canal. The
                        Chinese, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said, evidently tried to
                        be very nice to the Thai visitors.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Prasit</persName> told the Chinese that the Thai
                        were worried about terrorists. The Thai people, he said, assumed that the
                        Chinese were supporting the insurgents. <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1"
                            >Chou</persName> said “we” had nothing to do with this but would
                        continue to support freedom fighters. After the tournament there was a tour
                        of south China for the team and its advisors and <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> again appeared at the farewell party.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> said that the Thai were not
                        yet certain of Chinese motives. The Chinese understood that Thailand had
                        good relations with the U.S.</p>

                    <p>In response to the Secretary's query about Chinese support of liberation
                        movements, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName> noted that Bangladesh
                        was a liberation movement, but the Chinese did not support it. The Secretary
                        said that in his conversations in Peking the Chinese told him they favored
                        “liberation and turmoil.” He wondered about Africa, which obviously needed
                        peace and stability far more. <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>
                        said that <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Prasit</persName> had noted that there
                        was no case for liberation in Thailand and the subject was then dropped.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Purpose</p>
                    <p>To reassure the Thai as to the constancy of U.S. support for Thailand and for
                        our determination to continue to play a useful balancing role in the Asian
                        Pacific region.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Background, Participants, Press Plan</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. The Vice President, when he visited
                        Bangkok in mid-May, emphasized the constancy of U.S. purposes in Southeast
                        Asia. Nevertheless, the Thai leadership remains concerned over our long-term
                        intentions in Asia, especially in view of our Vietnam withdrawal, our China
                        initiative, and the growing internal insurgency in Thailand supported by
                        Peking and Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>Partly in reaction to this, Bangkok in recent months began exploring in
                        earnest the possibility of improving relations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. In August, talks in Peking between a
                        senior Thai official who accompanied the Thai ping pong team and <persName

                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is now sufficiently interested in
                        getting relations with Bangkok onto a different track to allow Bangkok to
                        set the pace in moving the relationship in that direction. With respect to
                        our military presence in Thailand and Thailand's other support for the
                        Indochina conflict, <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials mentioned
                        this only indirectly. Thailand, however, intends to move slowly and
                        prudently. The Government recently approved a small delegation to the Canton
                        Trade Fair this fall.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Sarasin</persName> is third in the current Thai leadership lineup
                        and is the ranking civilian. Although formally he is in charge of economic
                        and financial affairs, he also functions as Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>To the best of our knowledge, you last saw Sarasin during your July 1969
                        visit to Bangkok, when he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National
                        Development. He was Thai Ambassador to Washington between 1952 and 1957. A

                        negotiations with Hanoi. Specifically, were we thinking only in terms of a
                        ceasefire for Vietnam, or would we extend the cessation of hostilities to
                        include Laos and Cambodia? This was important to the Thai because they had
                        common borders with these countries. The President made it clear that our
                        position had been from the outset that we wanted the ceasefire to include
                        all of the countries of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName> raised another question on
                        behalf of Marshal Thanom: would it be possible for the U.S. to consult with
                        Thailand on its position with respect to the North Vietnamese if a
                        settlement seemed to be in the making? Thailand certainly did not wish to
                        influence the U.S. position, but due to the role which they had assumed in
                        the war— which they had taken willingly—the Thai hoped that they could be
                        kept informed.</p>
                    <p>The President said that we had this very much in mind, and that we would
                        certainly consult with the Thai<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">In an October 10

                        North Vietnamese had indicated in the Paris talks that they had an incentive
                        to bring the war to an end (this was due to the effectiveness of our bombing
                        and mining, and to the heavy North Vietnamese losses in the South) it did
                        not now appear that a settlement could be reached prior to the U.S.
                        elections. The President was confident, though, that a settlement would be
                        reached in the not too distant future. He was optimistic about the military
                        and political situation in South Vietnam.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName> mentioned that a group of
                        Asian nations, including Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and
                        Indonesia had been attempting to work out a formula for ending the war and
                        would continue these efforts.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName> informed the President that
                        he, <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Pote</persName>, had met <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Vice Foreign Minister Ch'iao Kuan-hua in
                        New York the preceding day. Ch'iao had not made an issue out of the U.S. use
                        of air bases in Thailand in connection with the war in Indochina. Although
                        he had referred to them, he had taken the line that the U.S. presence would
                        inevitably be removed from Thailand following the completion of the war.
                        According to <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName>, he had made it
                        very plain to Ch'iao that this was a matter which would be worked out
                        between the Thai and the Americans, and concerned them alone. The President
                        said that this position was exactly right. It was up to the U.S. and
                        Thailand to determine what kind of U.S. presence, if any, would remain there
                        after the fighting ended. Thailand would make its decision on the basis of
                        its own interests, as it had in the case of the air bases used by the U.S.
                        The President referred in this connection to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName>'s position on U.S. forces in
                        Thailand, in which only U.S. interests were considered.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName> said that the Thai were
                        interested in following up the current more friendly attitude of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> toward Thailand, and he had sent his own
                        assistant along with the Thai ping pong team to China to talk to senior
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> officials. However, while the
                        assistant had been well received, Thailand would be very cautious in its
                        dealings with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName> noted that the Chinese
                        antipathy toward the Soviet Union had figured in his conversation with
                        Ch'iao Kuan-hua to a considerable extent. The President described the tenor
                        of his own talks with the Chinese on the subject of the Soviets, and
                        attributed the Chinese willingness to deal with the U.S. in large part to
                        fear of the USSR— it was a matter of survival. As a consequence, the Chinese
                        had not <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0438"/>made a great issue out of
                        Taiwan in their conversations with us, nor of the U.S. presence in Thailand.
                        The President then proceeded to describe the strategic factors which in his
                        opinion influenced the Chinese in their attitudes toward the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, India, and the United States. The
                        Chinese did not want us to pull out of Asia at his time, and we were not
                        going to do so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS5">Khun Pote</persName> stated that he was very glad
                        to hear the President say the U.S. was not going to pull out, because there
                        were many people who felt that the U.S. was going to withdraw. The President
                        then stressed that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine
                        was not a means for getting us out of Asia but rather a means for enabling
                        us to stay on. He was confident that with continued U.S. support, which we
                        were going to provide (but which Senator <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2"
                            >McGovern</persName> wants us to remove) the free nations of Asia would
                        be able to hold their own against Communism. The President declared he was
                        optimistic that the free nations would do better than the Communist nations
                        of Asia.</p>

                        captured personnel might appear to be temporarily effective in helping to
                        eliminate the terrorist threat, it is illegal, morally indefensible and in
                        the long run discourages terrorist defection. The Thais are to be advised
                        that greater counterinsurgency impact could be achieved by proper and
                        detailed interrogation and follow-up psychological warfare action. A final
                        point to be made to the Thais is that if information on their action came to
                        the attention of sensation-seeking journalists, the matter could be highly
                        embarrassing to the Thai Government internally and internationally and could
                        also embarrass the U.S. Government's advisory position in south
                        Thailand.</p>

                        correct, adding that the approach to the Thais should be pursued vigorously
                        rather than waiting for appropriate opportunities to bring it up.</p>

                        contingent upon the terms dictated by the aggressive forces then it is
                        neither satisfactory nor in consonance with your noble goal of ‘peace with

                        questions of indirect aggression and externally supported insurgency in the
                        immediate neighboring states must be properly dealt with and included in the
                        terms of the eventual settlement.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the Thai role in support of U.S. actions in the Vietnam war,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> calls attention to Thai
                        base facilities which have been made available “gratuitously” to the U.S.
                        armed forces stationed on Thai soil— with consequent great savings to the
                        United States—this despite grave risks and heavy criticism, including
                        criticism from U.S. quarters.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> expresses the
                        belief that the U.S. continues to bear a great responsibility for the
                        preservation of the power equilibrium in the Asian-Pacific region and for
                        helping to bring prosperity to the nations of the region. Citing the “vital
                        concern” to Thailand of the questions he has raised, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> declares that for some, preventive
                        measures should be taken immediately; for others, exchanges of views are
                        necessary. He therefore suggests that “confidential discussions at a high
                        level between our two countries would be mutually beneficial,” and asks that
                        this suggestion receive the President's urgent attention.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>Clearly, the matters uppermost in <persName corresp="#p_TK5"
                            >Thanom</persName>'s mind are:</p>
                    <p>—The nature of the settlement which will be worked out for the war in
                        Indochina;</p>
                    <p>—Whether or not this settlement will safeguard Thai interests;</p>
                    <p>—The dimensions of the quid pro quo which the Thai should receive from the
                        U.S. in return for the large contributions which they have made to the U.S.
                        war effort.</p>
                    <p>These matters are indeed ones which we would expect the Thai to be concerned
                        about, and to want to receive the President's urgent attention. Accordingly,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName> will probably be
                        considerably put out if the visit to Saigon by the Vice President and
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> is not extended to
                        include Bangkok. We believe that it in fact would be highly desirable for
                        them to touch base with <persName corresp="#p_TK5">Thanom</persName>, even
                        though additional consultations with Prime Minister <persName

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I appreciated very much receiving your letter of December 12, 1972<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d184fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                184</ref>.</note> in which you quite clearly laid out your views on
                        the coming peace settlement in Vietnam. I have asked General <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> to deliver for me this reply to the
                        questions you have raised and to outline for you the present status of
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>May I first, however, thank you for your kind thoughts on my re-election and
                        your hopes for my second term which were contained in your letter of
                        December 12, as well as in your message of November 8. I was also moved by
                        your generous compliments on our efforts to bring about a settlement of the
                        conflict in Vietnam. We all hope that <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393"
                            facs="0442"/>this will be achieved soon on terms that will provide a
                        stable base for peace in the region.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your concern for the continued presence of substantial North
                        Vietnamese forces in Laos and the Khmer Republic, as well as for the
                        externally-inspired insurgency which you are confronting at home. I want to
                        assure you that we too are concerned about these problems. I know that you
                        are also greatly interested in the terms of a possible Vietnam peace
                        settlement. It is in view of these wholly understandable concerns on your
                        part that I have asked General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>
                        to discuss these matters with you at this important juncture.</p>
                    <p>As regards the question you raised concerning North Vietnamese forces in Laos
                        and the Khmer Republic, I would note that the draft peace settlement
                        contemplates the removal of these forces. May I also reiterate my gratitude
                        for the vital assistance which the Thai irregular forces have given in
                        coping with this problem in Laos.</p>
                    <p>As to the governing insurgency in Thailand, I am impressed by the increased
                        attention which your Government is now giving to this substantial threat to
                        your security and by the growing effectiveness with which you are meeting
                        this challenge. You may be sure we will continue to do everything we can to
                        provide the security and economic assistance necessary to assist you in
                        coping with this insurgency.</p>
                    <p>I am keenly aware of the burdens which Thailand has willingly assumed to help
                        defend the Republic of Vietnam against aggression from the north. Your
                        earlier contribution of troops and your present provision of Thai bases have
                        been invaluable in our combined effort to defeat this blatant attempt to
                        take over South Vietnam by military force. I recognize the difficulties
                        which your generous contributions have posed for Thailand, and want you to
                        know that these are deeply appreciated. At the same time, I know that you
                        recognize that the security of Thailand is a key to the stability of the
                        region. Your efforts in Vietnam—and in Indochina as a whole—are a reflection
                        on the importance of developments there to the security of Thailand. I want
                        to assure you that the United States intends to stand solidly behind its
                        longstanding security commitment to Thailand.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will share, in all candor, your concerns with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>. He will report these fully to me on
                        his return, and I assure you that I will give them my closest attention.</p>

                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName> introduced the question of
                        U.S.-Philippine relations with the observation that the Philippines must be
                        seen “not as a puppet, but as a friend.” He said that it had caused him
                        troubles when President <persName>Johnson</persName> had referred to him as
                        his “right arm in Asia.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName> said that, if the U.S. has problems in
                        Asia, it should “tell its friends first” as to how it planned to meet them,
                        rather than imposing solutions on Asia. Asked for an example, President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> cited the recent matter of <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName>'s overtures through the

                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had relayed the information through our

                        from the U.S. He had solicited U.S. views as to how to persuade Japan to
                        take a more responsible military role in Asia, but had run into a blank
                        wall.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> assured President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>'s high regard, cited the need to be in continuing
                        communication, and emphasized that if President <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        ever has suggestions to pass to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>, we shall look into them with care and answer them. He
                        promised to look into the <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>
                        question and be back in touch.</p>
                    <p>Toward the close of the meeting, President <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        reverted to the bilateral relation issue and reiterated that he wished to
                        remain close to <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0444"/>the U.S. but to
                        “adopt a stance of independence.” He did not wish to be “in opposition, or
                        disagreeable.” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed
                        that we do not want satellites, and we want the Philippines to show
                        themselves independent. We do, however, judge our friends in large degree by
                        their actions. If the Philippines agrees with us on actions to be taken in
                        the area, we do not much care about the superficial factors. President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> underlined that we agree on the need to
                        oppose Communism, the common goal of security in the area, and the need to
                        take effective measures to attain those ends. He said that the Philippines
                        can help us with other Asians in pursuing those goals. He wanted U.S.
                        military bases to remain in the Philippines both for their economic benefit
                        and because there should be a U.S. presence in Asia.</p>
                    <p>In parting, President <persName>Marcos</persName> raised the Laurel–Langley
                            agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">The Laurel–Langley agreement
                            granted the Philippines preferential U.S. tariff treatment for sugar and
                            other key exports. It was negotiated by Senator José Laurel as head of a
                            Philippine economic mission sent to the United States in 1955 by
                            President Magsaysay.</note> He warned that the Philippines may strike
                        very tough bargaining positions in the negotiations over the follow-on to
                        Laurel–Langley. He asked for understanding, and said that some Philippine
                        industries, such as sugar, will collapse if the preferential arrangements
                        are not extended. The effect on the Philippine economy would be
                        catastrophic. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had instructed
                        him to look into the matter, and he would do so.</p>

                        more effective if it withdrew <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>,
                        which was proving very expensive, and concentrated on helping the <gloss
                            target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to develop an effective constabulary force.
                        He observed that the Philippines has much relevant experience. The training
                        programs could perhaps be conducted in the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has been interested in an
                        improved constabulary operation for weeks. It should probably not be either
                        incorporated in the military or run by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.
                        He wished to look into President <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                        suggestion.</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName> wondered whether General Valeriano, now
                        resident in the States, might be a good person to take over the development
                        of a constabulary.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked the President's
                        thoughts on possibilities for a settlement. President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> supported the idea that the South Vietnamese
                        should work out their internal arrangements, and that the U.S. might be able
                        to work out a satisfactory military withdrawal as the first <pb n="396"
                            xml:id="pg_396" facs="0445"/>topic for the talks. He believed that
                        Hanoi, which had thought that time was on its side, was beginning to have
                        doubts. During the subsequent discussion, President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> asked whether the U.S. would be willing to
                        withdraw, to which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said
                        that we would not withdraw precipitately or unilaterally. The other side
                        must also withdraw from Laos and Cambodia; then we will withdraw.</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName> remarked on a recent conversation with
                        Vice President Ky; he said that Ky had shown himself “eager” to meet with
                        the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> leaders. Asked whether this reflects
                        mistrust of us, President <persName>Marcos</persName> guessed that Ky may
                        fear a U.S.–<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> deal without knowledge, but
                        that this fear is probably transitory.</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName> asked pointblank whether there are any
                        moves under way to promote conversations beyond the public ones in Paris.
                        Who is doing it, and what are the prospects? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> professed a lack of knowledge as to the
                        initiatives of various parties, but said that the Communists are realists;
                        if they believe it better to settle now rather than two years hence, they
                        will settle now. Asked again whether there are private negotiations
                        presently underway with North Vietnam, he said that there have been private
                        meetings from time to time, but that there is not a continuing series going
                        on now. President <persName>Marcos</persName> then suggested that there
                        should be such talks, and that public talks in Paris would be useless
                        without them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked whether President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> felt that we were consulting sufficiently
                        with him. The President said that consultation has been adequate so far, but
                        that the time may be approaching for more consultations with Asian leaders.
                        They must be private.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japan</p>
                    <p>In answer to a question, President <persName>Marcos</persName> said that the
                        Philippines would look favorably upon a Japanese role in regional military
                        security, “<hi rend="italic">provided the U.S. were there</hi>.” He had been
                        interested in remarks which <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had
                        made concerning the increase in the Japanese military budget and amendments
                        to the Constitution. <persName>Marcos</persName> said that he was
                        interested, and wondered whether there were a “new trend” in Japanese
                        thinking. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated
                        that he doubted that the Japanese were yet ready for a major expansion in
                        their military expenditures.</p>

                    <p>I had lunch with President and Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> on Wednesday,
                        April 2. The President was in a jubilant mood. I hadn't seen him this elated
                        in over six months. He felt his visit was a great success. Also he felt he
                        had outmaneuvered his opponents (Magsaysay and Osmena).</p>
                    <p>Two important results of the trip according to <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        were:</p>
                    <p>(1) He was convinced the U.S. and in particular the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> was not consorting with his political enemies. I asked him
                        point blank at lunch how his talks with the Director went.<note n="2"

                            According to an undated memorandum from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> to Richard K. Stuart (<gloss target="#t_INR1"

                            assistance of the Department of State.” <persName>Marcos</persName> had

                            Philippine affairs. The Director took the occasion to assure
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> was supporting no candidate for President of the

                        He answered that he was convinced that there was no effort on <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s part to undermine him. On the contrary he
                        seemed to feel that he had the support of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> administration. (Whether this present feeling that the

                        political jungle of Manila remains to be seen.)</p>
                    <p>(2) He said he had an excellent talk with President <persName

                        he (<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>) ever wanted to have an
                        “Asian opinion” President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> could
                        quietly check with him. At this point he indicated his severe displeasure
                        with President <persName>Johnson</persName>'s statement about him
                            (<persName>Marcos</persName>) “that he (<persName>Marcos</persName>) was
                        his right arm in Asia.” <persName>Marcos</persName> said he was “still

                    <p>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> said he discussed Laurel–Langley with President

                            <persName>Marcos</persName> asked the President to extend these economic
                        privileges beyond the expiration of Laurel–Langley. If these privileges were

                        advice of some unspecified sort in the coming months. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> ultimately said that he would like to
                        help if he could but <persName corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName> was not
                        sure whether he had made a firm undertaking to establish the requested
                        contact. The only other thing that transpired at this meeting was that the
                        Filipinos managed to get <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> and

                        Director, expressed the gravest concern over the proposed contact which was
                        patently intended by <persName>Marcos</persName> to give him political
                        advantage [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
                        The proposed relationship would also undermine the position of the new
                        Ambassador and, if established before he arrived, would put him in a
                        particularly disadvantageous position. I supported <persName

                        would be much easier not to establish the relationship than to break it off
                        later. <persName corresp="#p_GGMM1">Godley</persName>, while recognizing the

                        clarification of this point the matter would be discussed with the seventh

                        want to pursue the question further with <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"
                            >Helms</persName>. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"

                            <persName>Johnson</persName> who took the position that no contact
                        should be established at least until it can be discussed with the new

                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> is being informed of this,

                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had numerous meetings with U.S. officials in
                            Washington during the first 4 days of April despite the fact that the
                            Embassy in Manila was advised that “it would be extremely difficult” to
                            make arrangements for them because “U.S. officials will be very much
                            occupied” with the funeral of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>. Telegram 48924 to Manila, March 29, advised
                            that Australian Prime Minister Gorton's March 31 official visit had been
                            cancelled, and stated that although “we would not want to discourage
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> from attending” the funeral, “it should
                            be made clear to him that it would be most difficult if not impossible
                            to combine ceremonial attendance at funeral with a working visit.”

                    <p>2. From the Philippine point of view, we believe the visit was a smashing

                        We understand <persName>Marcos</persName> left convinced that he stands well
                        with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration, that
                        the U.S. Government is not and will not be involved in supporting his
                        opponents in the upcoming election, and that we appreciate reasons and have
                        sympathy for his recent statements about the need for a more self-reliant
                        Philippines and a more independent Philippine foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>3. The visit thus served our purpose in removing or allaying the extreme
                        suspicions and fears which have been so evident recently in
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' attitude toward us.</p>
                    <p>4. From a longer run point of view, however, the visit had about it an unreal
                        air for all the discussions were focused on what the Philippines want from
                        us. Meetings obviously arranged at last minute, U.S. participants hard
                        pressed for time and there was little or no discussion of our specific
                        current problems in the Philippines, such as Science tax, Customs
                        negotiations, validity of 1965 amendment to bases agreement, <gloss
                            target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> problem, territorial seas, etc.</p>

                    <p>5. On substantive points (as distinct from atmospherics)
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> placed great stress on his balance of
                        payments problem and the resulting <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        desire for: (a) ensured repatriation of dollars earned by overseas Filipino
                        employees; (b) tight controls over dollars spent by the U.S. Government and
                        U.S. personnel in Philippines so that dollars stay out of black market and
                        end up in <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> reserves; (c) need for U.S.
                        sympathy and cooperation in <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> limiting
                        non-essential imports (automobiles, textiles, tobacco, etc.)</p>
                    <p>6. We indicated that we thought we could be helpful in several ways. We
                        mentioned possibility of “lipsticking” U.S.G. social security and Veterans
                        benefits checks as one example. In subsequent rather confused exchange with
                        newsmen at press conference <persName>Marcos</persName> indicated he thought
                        we might “lipstick” dollar payments to U.S. military personnel stationed at
                        Philippine bases. He also seemed to think that U.S. was paying Philippino
                        base employees in dollars. In short, <persName>Marcos</persName> was pleased
                        with what we said, but seemed quite unclear about specifics. Should this
                        come up, suggest you make point that “lipsticking” would apply only to U.S.
                        benefit checks issued to Philippine residents. You might also make the point
                        that it would be easier for us to be helpful on the whole problem of dollar
                        control if <persName>Marcos</persName> could put an end to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> attempt to impose in violation of the
                        military bases agreement the Science tax on privately owned vehicles of our
                        military personnel in Philippines. That matter is arousing considerable
                        adverse Congressional reaction, and creates climate in which dollar control
                        measures are more difficult to establish and to enforce.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName>Marcos</persName> discussed Laurel–Langley extensively. He
                        stressed that withdrawal of U.S. preferential treatment for Phil products in
                        U.S. market would result in severe economic damage to Philippines. He said
                        withdrawal of sugar quota would cause collapse of sugar industry. At
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' request, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> agreed that U.S. would do nothing to
                        raise this issue this year or to publicize possible U.S.G. unwillingness
                        extend tariff preferences beyond life of Laurel–Langley. This is based on
                        our assumption (not made explicit by <persName>Marcos</persName>) that
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> will defer further consultations on
                        Laurel–Langley until 1970.</p>
                    <p>8. Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> reported
                        extensively in another channel which you should see. In unlikely event
                        question of direct contact comes up, urge that you avoid any statement.
                        (Matter still under consideration here.)</p>
                    <p>9. <persName>Marcos</persName> raised with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> the possibility of the withdrawal of <gloss
                            target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>, and suggested that the Philippines
                        might concentrate instead on helping <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                        develop an effective constabulary, possibly through training in the
                        Philippines. Should this be raised, suggest you defer any comment beyond
                        possibly mentioning importance of a united front in Vietnam at this stage
                        and wondering rhetorically <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0451"/>whether

                    <p>10. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> discussed possibility of visit by Secretary

                        aware of Secretary's desire visit Manila, but that when you left Washington
                        his schedule was tight and plans not worked out.</p>

                        if so, how such a meeting could be arranged.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pros and Cons</p>
                    <p>There is no gainsaying the fact that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>'s visit will be—indeed is already being—interpreted by
                        the Filipinos as an act having an important bearing on their Presidential
                        election. If President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> does not
                        see Osmena, this will be interpreted as an indication that we expect
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> to win, want him to win, and are content to
                        let <persName>Marcos</persName> harvest all the spin-off benefits of the
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, it is by no means certain that President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> will win the November election. Osmena may
                        well be the Philippine chief executive during a period of critical
                        transition in U.S.–Philippine relations. It is not prudent to ignore that
                        possibility.</p>

                    <p>Finally, Senator Osmena is unquestionably disappointed that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has refused to see him
                        during Osmena's current visit to the United States.<note n="2"

                            Donald Kendall, CEO of Pepsico Inc., on July 1, to explain the decision
                            not to see Osmena in Washington. Kendall said he was dining with Osmena
                            that evening and was “prepared to give Osmena any message” <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought he should have.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that “we have
                            nothing against him and would not be heartbroken if he won election—odds
                            favor the other guy. Kendall said one thing that bothers Osmena is that
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> will use the President's trip” and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that “he gets nothing
                            but good reports about Osmena which makes it tough but does not think
                            Pres. should see him.” Kendall asked if there was any particular message
                            which <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wanted passed to
                            Osmena. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> “said only that

                        <persName>Marcos</persName> would doubtless prefer that we ignore Osmena.
                        However, the <persName>Marcos</persName> reception in Washington in April
                        was excellent and he was extremely pleased by it. The President's visit to
                        Manila will be a political boon of the first water to
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, even if it includes a brief meeting with
                        Osmena. <persName>Marcos</persName> is certainly conscious of all this and
                        can, we believe, be persuaded to accept without too much ill grace a contact
                        with Osmena.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Modalities</p>
                    <p>1. We should inform President <persName>Marcos</persName> that Senator Osmena
                        has requested a meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>. We should point out that it is very difficult to
                        refuse such a request, particularly in view of the tradition that U.S.
                        Presidents, in dealing with our democratic friends, customarily meet with
                        leaders of the opposition as a normal aspect of political intercourse
                        between open societies.</p>
                    <p>2. We should inform <persName>Marcos</persName> that to de-personalize the
                        meeting somewhat we propose that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> will have a brief meeting on the evening of his
                        arrival with the leaders of the opposition, that is Party Chairman Roxas,
                        Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>,
                        Presidential candidate Osmena and Vice Presidential candidate Magsaysay.</p>
                    <p>Embassy Manila agrees that a meeting with Osmena is important, if not in
                        Washington, then in Manila. We favor Manila for the meeting, <pb n="404"

                        his request for a meeting here with the President. Moreover, a meeting here
                        is more subject to misinterpretation and distortion than one in Manila, and
                        would not really substitute for a Manila meeting.</p>

                        covers general themes which are applicable to Thailand, the Philippines and
                        Indonesia. This memorandum covers those themes which are peculiar to the
                        Philippines. Your arrival comes at a time when the Philippines are facing
                        many urgent problems. Domestically, corruption and inefficiency in
                        government have reached proportions sufficient to menace economic stability.
                        There are virtually no foreign exchange reserves, and there is an unhealthy
                        reliance upon the income derived from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        bases and military expenditures. Separatist sentiment among <pb n="405"

                        Philippines is increasing, due in large part to a feeling that the economic
                        and political aspirations of the Muslims are being ignored.</p>
                    <p>On the foreign side, there has been widespread Filipino criticism of the
                        Philippine contribution to Vietnam, the <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1"

                        national development. Filipino nationalism has been aroused over an old
                        claim to Malyasian Sabah (North Borneo), and last year it became public
                        knowledge that President <persName>Marcos</persName> was supporting a
                        clandestine effort to infiltrate Philippine Muslim saboteurs into Sabah.
                        This effort has been stopped, but Philippine-Malaysian relations remain
                        strained. The development of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> (the

                        Yet the Filipinos are economically and emotionally dependent on us, and not
                        prepared to make the sacrifices which alternatives to the present

                    <p>An election campaign is underway. President <persName>Marcos</persName> is

                        confidant. His principal opponent, Sergio Osmena, has also attempted to

                        your visit for his political purposes, and to prevent rival candidate Osmena
                        from benefiting from your visit. Arrangements have been made for you to have
                        some contact with Osmena and other opposition leaders to counterbalance

                        He wants these both for political reasons—to show his ability to get things
                        from the Americans—and to help alleviate very real and pressing economic
                        problems. His proposed agenda for talks with you amounts in part to a
                        “shopping list” which includes financial aid to support the currency;
                        economic assistance (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, <gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> development loan funds); trade concessions
                        (early negotiations on the Laurel–Langley Agreement, which would extend
                        until 1974 Philippine tariff preferences in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> market, with reciprocal advantages for <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> businessmen in the Philippines); and
                        Philippine participation in post-war rehabilitation and construction in
                        Vietnam (a new “<persName>Marshall</persName> Plan” for Asia).</p>
                    <p>—We have informed the Filipinos that you will not wish to discuss economic
                        issues in detail, but we expect that <persName>Marcos</persName> will
                        nevertheless give it a try.</p>
                    <p>c. Third, <persName>Marcos</persName> may want you to agree to a review of
                        the status of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bases in the
                        Philippines. Although the three main <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bases
                        (Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base, and Sangley Point Naval Station) are
                        recognized by the Filipinos as key contributions to Philippine defense, they
                        also resent the bases as vestiges of colonialism and seek a greater degree
                        of Philippine sovereignty and control. Particular Filipino objectives are
                        obtaining more favorable terms on criminal jurisdiction, a return of some
                        base lands, and a greater voice in the administration of the bases.</p>
                    <p>d. Fourth, <persName>Marcos</persName> hopes for increased <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military assistance. There is substantial
                        dissident movement in Central Luzon, against which
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> wants greater material and logistical
                        support (helicopters, <gloss target="#t_M161">M–16</gloss>'s and
                        construction of military highways). In part, this may be a disguised way of
                        gaining extra economic assistance. <persName>Marcos</persName> would also
                        like a more automatic defense commitment under the Mutual Defense Treaty.
                        (In the Philippine dispute with Malaysia over Sabah, he resented the fact
                        that we did not regard the Treaty as covering a Malaysian attack.)</p>
                    <p>e. Finally, <persName>Marcos</persName> will want to hear your views on
                        Vietnam and the Paris negotiations, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        role in Asia after the Vietnam conflict, the Sino-Soviet dispute, and the
                        Soviet role in Asia. Paradoxically, these major issues weigh less in the
                        minds of the Filipinos than do internal issues. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        has also sanctioned increasing contacts with the Soviet Union, Eastern
                        Europe and Communist China.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">What We Want</hi>: You will want your presence to be
                        taken as evidence of your own and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>'s warm
                        and sincere friendship for the Filipino people. You recognize that there
                        have been strains and misunderstandings in our relationship, and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bears its share of the responsibility
                        for the problems which have arisen. For your part you <pb n="407"
                            xml:id="pg_407" facs="0456"/>will do whatever you can to reduce sources
                        of friction and to restore <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine
                        relations to the levels of mutual confidence and respect which formerly
                        existed. You are emphatically not looking towards a “special relationship”
                        which would downgrade Philippine sovereignty; you recognize that the
                        Filipinos are searching for a new sense of national identify, and you
                        support them in their search. To this end, you will wish to put our
                        relations on a more equal basis, and to begin the process of eliminating
                        some of the sources of Manila's present anti-Americanism, while maintaining
                        our friendly relations, our base rights and other facilities in the
                        Philippines.</p>
                    <p>You will also want to show that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        continues to support Philippine economic progress and security. You are
                        willing to explore ways in which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might
                        make its aid more effective, and would encourage the Filipinos to
                        participate in regional arrangements such as <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss> as well.</p>
                    <p>Although Philippine concerns over the Vietnam war and post-Vietnam Asia are
                        perhaps less than in other countries which you will visit, you will want
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> to know your thoughts and, if possible,
                        encourage him to play a more active and constructive role in regional
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Points You Should Stress:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine
                        economic relationship:</p>
                    <p>—Emphasize your interest in growing Philippine self-reliance, and endorse
                        Philippine efforts to establish broader relations, particularly through
                        regional organizations such as <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Point to the inherent dangers of extreme Philippine reliance upon a single
                        market. (We presently take 44% of Philippine exports.)</p>
                    <p>—Remain noncommittal on the Laurel–Langley negotiations, but indicate
                        willingness to see progress made. (<persName>Marcos</persName> has already
                        raised this matter with you and me.) Make clear that the ultimate objective
                        should be warm and friendly relations without special preferences.</p>
                    <p>—Refer specific economic problems to the advisers or to regular <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine consultations, emphasizing the
                        need for careful staff work.</p>
                    <p>—On a “<persName>Marshall</persName> Plan” for Asia, you will want to point
                        to the problems both at home and in terms of the Paris negotiations of
                        attempting to describe and launch a major new aid structure for Asia at this
                        time. You may also wish to point out that the time is past for unilateral
                        donor programs, and that we hope to cooperate with other rich nations in
                        encouraging economic development in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. The Military Bases</p>
                    <p>—Suggest that you express willingness to work toward an amicable resolution
                        of differences which would at the same time preserve <pb n="408"
                            xml:id="pg_408" facs="0457"/>the utility of the bases in defense of
                        Philippine and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> security. You are
                        interested in cutting down the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> presence in
                        foreign countries. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces overseas have
                        already been reduced. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> base issues should
                        be susceptible of resolution through negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">c. Military Assistance</p>
                    <p>—You would appreciate a review by <persName>Marcos</persName> of the nature
                        of the dissident movement, and will refer any requests he may submit for
                        stepped-up assistance to the proper officials of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> Government.</p>
                    <p>—Any review of the Mutual Defense Treaty would need to take place under
                        circumstances in which all considerations can be carefully reviewed and both

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Following is telegraphic summary of memcon covering meeting of Presidents
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> with presidential advisers (reftel) in
                        Manila July 26. Memcon itself approved by <persName corresp="#p_GM3"

                    <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he and
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> had again had a good talk, covering
                        general exchange of views as well as certain bilateral problems. In latter
                        category were military assistance and Philippine financial problems. He and
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> has agreed that such problems should
                        be worked out by the people that handle them on a day-to-day basis. The
                        President noted that the United States had a few financial problems itself,
                        and he would refer specific questions to <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409"
                            facs="0458"/>Secretaries of State and Treasury and New York bankers for
                        further consideration.</p>
                    <p>3. Of greater interest, the President continued, was their discussion of
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> future role in Asia. Manner in which
                        war in Vietnam was settled would have considerable bearing on this question.
                        He had described progress of Paris Talks, and said there were some “glimmers
                        of change” leading to hope, but no real change. Lull in fighting, how-ever,
                        deserved careful watching. For its part, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        has been as forthcoming as it could be and President Thieu could not go
                        further without being brought down.</p>
                    <p>The President said that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had withdrawn
                        forces and would withdraw more. If Hanoi increased military activity in face
                        of this, further appraisal would be necessary. At same time did not want to
                        appear too pessimistic since there was some possibility we might be on verge
                        of break over.</p>
                    <p>5. Way in which war concluded, the President added, must not prejudice future
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role in Asia. American experience in
                        Korea and Vietnam tended to disillusion average American. But <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is Pacific power and must continue to play
                        major role in area of vital future significance. Therefore satisfactory
                        long-term solution to Vietnam problem must be found which will not damage
                        American spirit. New approaches thus were needed. The <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> will continue to help, he said, but cannot continue as we
                        have sometimes done in the past, to try to do it all ourselves.</p>
                    <p>6. President <persName>Marcos</persName> said he had been greatly heartened
                        at what President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had said to
                        him. He had been deply concerned about the prospect of an American
                        withdrawal. He now understood <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> dilemma and
                        had received new perspective on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        difficulties. Other Asian countries as well would be happy to know <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had no intention of precipitate
                        withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>7. Under these circumstances, President <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        continued, he felt the Philippines could plan to face the dangers of
                        internal subversion rather than external aggression. On former Philippines
                        needed to develop capabilities farther. He noted that Red China is still
                        trying to export subversive war, and that he needed <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> material help but not <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        forces. He and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had
                        agreed, he said, that economic stability was an essential element in
                        resisting internal subversion.</p>

                    <p>10217. Subject: Election Interference.</p>
                    <p>1. We have had in the last three days a most worrisome development in <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine relations, but as of now I believe
                        things are getting back on the track. It had to do with charges that illegal
                        electioneering material and bogus money were entering the Philippines
                        through the Mactan air base and that senior <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> officers, both civilian and military, were involved in this
                        activity. These accusations were accompanied by an informal request that the
                        accused officers be removed from the Philippines. This message reports an
                        interview with acting Foreign Secretary Ingles on September 26 and President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> on September 28.</p>
                    <p>2. Acting Secretary Ingles asked me<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">The new U.S.
                            Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Henry A. Byroade</persName>,
                            presented his credentials to the Philippine Government on August
                            29.</note> to call at 5:30 on September 26. Executive Secretary Maceda
                        was in his office when I arrived and was present during the meeting.</p>
                    <p>3. Ingles said he wanted to relay to me a message from President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>. It was a very serious charge that some of
                        our people were interfering in Philippine internal affairs by taking sides
                        in the election. He said that the President had intelligence reports which
                        indicated that propaganda material and counterfeit money was coming in on
                        our aircraft landing at Mactan and being turned over to the opposition.
                        Ingles said that they wanted to inspect our incoming cargo to prevent this
                        from happening in the future.</p>
                    <p>4. I told him that I did not know the terms of our base agreement affecting
                        Mactan but would look into the matter urgently and be in touch with him as
                        soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>5. Ingles then said that the evidence pointed to the involvement of two
                        officers in the Mactan area and two senior officers in the Embassy, and that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had asked that these officers be removed
                        from the Philippines. Maceda at this point broke in to say that the
                        President was so concerned that he had considered sending <persName>Kokoy
                            Romualdez</persName> to Washington to convey the evidence.</p>
                    <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0460"/>
                    <p>6. I told Maceda that I was making a formal request through him to see
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> at the first opportunity. I said that
                        I would like to see the evidence, that I would investigate the matter
                        thoroughly, but that I was convinced that no senior officer of the Embassy
                        could be engaged in any such action. Ingles, in a somewhat sheepish manner,
                        said that it was of course not necessary to produce evidence. I agreed, but
                        said that it would be most unusual in the relations between two friendly
                        countries, particularly the Philippines and the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>, to send home senior officers under such a cloud. This
                        request, I continued, would come as a great shock to Washington and I felt
                        that it would be best for our overall relations not to report the
                        conversation until I had talked personally to the President. I said that if
                        I did report it I would obviously get instructions to see the President
                        anyway at the earliest opportunity. At this point Maceda said something
                        which made it apparent that there was uncertainty about the identity of one
                        of the officers. I said that this uncertainty made it all the more necessary
                        for me to talk personally to the President and clear up the matter. Maceda
                        said that he would radio to the President and arrange for an
                        appointment.</p>
                    <p>7. I saw <persName>Marcos</persName> at 8:30 last night shortly after he had
                        returned from a campaign trip. After delivering the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> family pictures (a good time for them
                        to arrive!), I said that Maceda and Ingles had previously given me a most
                        serious matter which I felt necessitated a request to see him even in the
                        midst of his demanding schedule. <persName>Marcos</persName> said that he
                        was truly concerned about some reports he had seen of activities at Mactan.
                        He doubted that the traffic concerned was of real significance but hoped
                        that it could be stopped before it became significant. He said he could
                        hardly believe our officials at Mactan were involved, but the evidence he
                        had was disturbing.</p>
                    <p>8. I told <persName>Marcos</persName> it was most important that he not
                        misunderstand what I was about to say. I wanted him to know first of all
                        that I recognized beyond any doubt that the final decision as to what
                        foreigners remained in his country was up to him. I also wanted him to know
                        that at this point I was in no position to deny anything that might have
                        happened at Mactan because I was in no position to know. My chief request to
                        him was to furnish us with such evidence as he could so that we could make a
                        most thorough investigation. I told him that I would lead this investigation
                        personally and would like to go to Mactan on Tuesday, probably accompanied
                        by General Gideon's inspector general, if I could get the facts in time to
                        make that schedule. I went on to tell him that my instructions from the
                        Secretary of State and the President were explicit that no American should
                        involve himself in any way in the election process in the Philippines. I had
                        personally passed this out after my arrival, not only to my senior staff,
                        but also at the various bases that I had been able to visit so far. I had
                        followed this <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0461"/>up with a written
                        instruction to every American to not only remain out of the election process
                        completely, but to avoid any act that could through misunderstanding cause
                        the slightest suspicion of being involved. I said that in the face of all
                        this I found it very difficult to believe that American personnel were
                        involved, because their careers would be at stake, and we operated a very
                        tight system where matters such as this were involved. I said this was one
                        reason I had not so far reported the matter to Washington as I was afraid of
                        severe reaction there, caused by an unwillingness to believe that our senior
                        people could be involved, particularly so as we had been given no
                        evidence.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName>Marcos</persName> interrupted to ask if I had not been given
                        details of their charges, and seemed surprised when I replied in the
                        negative. He said he would provide them to me and attempted unsuccessfully
                        to get the papers from his staff as it was late Sunday evening. I told him I
                        did not want to take his personal time on such a matter in any event and he
                        agreed to supply the information to me through Rafferty today. He said that
                        I would find that some of the information including items, tail numbers,
                        etc. would be specific.</p>
                    <p>10. The President said he was most concerned about counterfeit money,
                        campaign propaganda, and weapons coming in from outside the Philippines. He
                        had specific information, that he felt had nothing to do with us, that the
                        first shipment of 10 million pesos supplied by a Stephen Sy, a Chinese in
                        Hong Kong, was to arrive in the Philippines between the 25th and 30th
                        September, after a couple of trial runs of other less important amounts and
                        items. In this connection it occurred to him that perhaps that past
                        shipments in question into Mactan might have been these trial shipments.</p>
                    <p>11. I told him that by Tuesday night Mactan, at least from the American side,
                        would be one tight airport. I said I would talk to General Gideon as soon as
                        he returns, and to his deputy in his absence about tightening up at Clark in
                        every conceivable way.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName>Marcos</persName> never mentioned the two senior officers here
                        in Manila, nor did he say anything about desiring that I have any people
                        removed. I believe, therefore, particularly with the steps that I told him I
                        would take, that a <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> request is not in the
                        works.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName>Marcos</persName> sounds as if he has hard evidence, but
                        considering the heightening Malacanang tensions as election day approaches,
                        we may find nothing but a sinister interpretation of an innocent incident.
                        However, since the charge comes directly from the head of state, I feel we
                        must make an honest effort to investigate.</p>
                    <p>14. An extreme position of subordinates followed by a calmer, moderate
                        attitude of the boss is, I understand, Filipino tactic to test the water,
                        and <persName>Marcos</persName> may have also been floating a

                            n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">On September 22 the White House Working Group set
                            up an Interdepartmental Coordinating Group, chaired by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>, to supervise testimony
                            before the Subcommittee. In a November memorandum to Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, John D. Erlichman
                            stated that <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> “was
                            given clear instructions at this meeting, as to the categories of
                            materials that should not be given to the Subcommittee.” Erlichman added
                            that it was explained to <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
                                >McClintock</persName> that “the President had directed that
                            guidelines for these hearings be set by the White House rather than by
                            each department.” <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> was
                            also advised that no witness was to give any indication “that the White
                            House was supervising or issuing instructions.” (Ibid.) In a September
                            24 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BLKF1">Kenneth BeLieu</persName>
                            at the White House (who was also a member of the Working Group),
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> delineated eight
                            types of material or information “which under no circumstances should be
                            divulged to the Subcommittee,” including information on nuclear storage,
                            military contingency plans, and privileged communications between Chiefs
                            of State or government. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
                                >McClintock</persName> continued that the “Working Group defined
                            materials or information which can be provided the Committee in
                            sanitized version in the following four categories: 1) Corruption and
                            crimes against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> personnel and property
                            in the Philippines; 2) Programs directed toward counter-insurgency
                            matters; 3) Air defense arrangements between <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and P.I.; 4) Negotiations for <gloss

                                corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> noted that “a large amount
                            of data” had already been provided to the Subcommittee, including
                            international commitments, U.S. military facilities, forces, and
                            missions in the Philippines, the Military Assistance Program and <gloss

                            programs for counterinsurgency for the Philippines, joint military
                            planning, and the Philippine contribution to the war effort in Vietnam,
                            particularly <gloss target="#t_PHILCAGV1">PHILCAGV</gloss>.
                            (Ibid.)</note> seems fairly evident.</p>

                    <p>A major theme will be to try to make a case that past Administrations, and by
                        inference the present Administration, have undertaken commitments to foreign
                        governments far in excess of the basic defense agreements which were
                        ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. A case in point is the
                        communiqué issued by the White House on October 6, 1964, following talks
                        between President <persName>Johnson</persName> and the then Philippine
                        President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, which stated:</p>
                    <p>“They reviewed, in this connection, the importance of the Mutual Defense
                        Treaty between the Philippines and the United States in maintaining the
                        security of both countries, and reaffirmed their commitment to meet any
                        threat that might arise against their security. President
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> made it clear that, in accordance with
                        these existing alliances and the deployment and dispositions thereunder, any
                        armed attack against the Philippines would be regarded as an attack against
                        the United States forces stationed there and against the United States and
                        would instantly be repelled.”</p>
                    <p>A similar case occurred with Korea. In reply to a press conference question
                        in Korea on February 23, 1966, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> made the following statement:</p>
                    <p>“The United States Government and the people of the United States have a firm
                        commitment to the defense of Korea. As long as there is one American soldier
                        on the line of the border, the demarcation line, the whole and the entire
                        power of the United States of America is committed to the security and
                        defense of Korea.”</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that when eventually the Secretary or you are asked to testify
                        before the Subcommittee on overall policy with regard to overseas
                        commitments, the line to be taken is that we frankly recognize that the
                        statements made by the last Administration were in fact in excess <pb
                            n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0464"/>of our explicit treaty obligations.
                        What the present Administration seeks to do is to go back to the letter of
                        those agreements ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. This
                        has already been suggested by the Secretary's speech in Canberra on August
                        8, and by you in your speech in New York on September 5.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> is obsessed with the
                        fear of imminent bankruptcy of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He is
                        convinced that a major measure for cutting down government spending lies in
                        the broad field of our overseas commitments, which would include the <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program and bases. At this point, Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> removes his fiscal hat
                        and puts on his General's cap. Another of his obsessions is the idea that
                        overseas bases are no longer necessary because <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> missiles and Polaris submarine rockets make the stationing
                        of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> conventional forces abroad no longer
                        necessary. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>
                        apparently has not thought through the implications of resorting to
                        strategic nuclear war as the only alternative to the limited deployment of
                        conventional forces in given circumstances. Without saying so, he comes
                        close to the Dulles doctrine of massive retaliation.</p>
                    <p>All the Senators, but particularly Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                            >Fulbright</persName>, bore down heavily in the Philippine hearings on
                        the theme: “Why do we pay so much and get so little?” They were indignant
                        that the Philippine government refused to send even a civic action group to
                        Viet Nam until the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had engaged itself to
                        supply the equipment for three engineer battalions and to pay per diem for
                        the officers and men who actually went to the Philippines. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> dealt at great length yesterday
                        on what he regards as the exorbitant mercenary pay we agreed to give the
                        Koreans for the two divisions now fighting Viet Nam. He referred a number of
                        times to the “<persName corresp="#p_BWG2">Brown</persName> letter,” which
                        purportedly engages this government to pay for the Korean expeditionary
                        force, and said its contents had been published in a Japanese newspaper.</p>
                    <p>The main theme of protest that our client states receive so much from the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and contribute practically nothing in
                        return was made repeatedly in the case of the Philippines where “millions of
                        dollars” had been poured into the country but even in a situation involving
                        the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Alliance, the government at
                        Manila would not send even a token detachment unless backsheesh was paid in
                        advance.</p>
                    <p>A kindred theme is corruption. To read the testimony of the Philippine
                        hearings, one would think that a principal function of Clark Air Force Base
                        is to subsidize illegally or otherwise the iniquitous City of Angeles, which
                        is adjacent to the Base and whose inhabitants are anything <pb n="416"
                            xml:id="pg_416" facs="0465"/>but angels. Evidences of corruption of high
                        officials going right up to the top of the Philippine government were freely
                        disclosed by the Air Force OSI colonel who heads up a sort of export <gloss
                            target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> operation at Clark Field. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> made the point that the presence
                        of Clark Air Force Base was in fact an active incentive to theft and
                        corruption. About the only amusing aspect of this part of the testimony was
                        that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, which was late in getting in its
                        written statement 24 hours in advance of the hearings, excused its tardiness
                        on the plea that to provide the statement earlier might have endangered the
                        Air Force colonel's life. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                            >Symington</persName>, tongue in cheeck, said he would write the
                        Secretary of Defense, praising the colonel's forthright testimony, but
                        suggesting that in view of the danger to his life, he not return to the
                        Philippines. We might keep this ploy in mind for certain other
                        witnesses.…</p>
                    <p>I suggested to our military witnesses yesterday that, if they could find an
                        opportunity, they should make a closely reasoned military rationale as to
                        why certain of our bases in the Philippines are still to be regarded as
                        assets and not as liabilities, as the testimony in the hearings might make
                        them seem. However, neither General Gideon nor Admiral Kauffman had such an
                        opportunity. I have, therefore, recommended to <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                            >DOD</gloss> that for future hearings in the prepared written testimony
                        Defense include such rationale as to specific bases and military programs
                        which may become subject to the Committee's scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> indicated a clear
                        intention to build up a case against the Department by piece-meal
                        interrogation of subordinate witnesses before he took on the Secretary of
                        State. For example, he tried repeatedly yesterday to pin down Mr. Wilson,
                        our witness on the Philippines, as to what reappraisals of East Asian policy
                        the Department would undertake and what in fact our new policy toward
                        communist China might be. I think we can expect in future hearings that
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> will continue to
                        press the same tactic. The answer by the witness in all cases should be that
                        questions of broad policy must be deferred until the Subcommittee meets with
                        the Secretary of State. This might, however, not be easy for Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in the hearings on Laos,
                        as he is a Deputy Assistant Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>'s philosophy toward
                        the Subcommittee's hearings was summed up succinctly in his own words
                        yesterday afternoon—“You give the Committee all the facts; we'll draw the
                        conclusions.”</p>

                        and that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine relations are rendered
                        more difficult as a result.</p>
                    <p>The President accordingly has directed that the Under Secretaries' Committee
                        undertake a review of our treaty and other relationships with the
                        Philippines, and that a negotiating position be drawn up, setting forth the
                        changes needed in our Military Bases Agreement to bring the privileges and
                        immunities enjoyed by the United States concerning base rights in the
                        Philippines down to a level comparable with the rights which we possess in
                        other independent countries where there are <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> bases. Particular attention should be paid to the questions
                        of length of tenure of bases and procedures for establishing criminal
                        jurisdiction. It is recognized that there are variations in our rights in
                        various countries, but the objective should be to put the Philippines on a
                        most-favored-nation basis.</p>
                    <p>The President has also directed that the Under Secretaries' Committee examine
                        the total physical area included within the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> bases, and the number of such bases, compared with the
                        facilities available in other countries, note being taken of the different
                        missions of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0467"/>bases in different countries.
                        Consideration should be given to the release of land in the Philippines
                        which may be surplus to military needs.</p>
                    <p>It is intended that when the foregoing studies have been completed, the
                        Department of State will prepare to invite the Government of the Philippines
                        to renegotiate the Military Bases Agreement so as to bring it into line with
                        other <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> overseas base agreements. This
                        approach to the Philippines should be made within a reasonable time after
                        the forthcoming Philippine elections, but not before them. It is envisaged
                        that the question of the release of land may be dealt with at a later stage
                        of the negotiations in order to permit sufficient time for this particular
                        study to be analyzed in detail. The target date for completion of the land
                        study should be January 1, 1970.</p>

                    <p>1. With the receipt of the second and third volumes of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> subcommittee hearings on the
                        Philippines I now for the first time have had a chance to judge personally
                        the full impact here of the pending publication of the present “sanitized”
                        version of those hearings.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">According to an
                            undated memorandum from Erlichman to <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> detailing White House complaints about <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>'s performance as Chairman
                            of the Interdepartmental Group and his ultimate removal on November 14,
                            the White House did not learn the basis of the deal that had been struck
                            between <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> until October 23, after
                            having been kept in the dark by the Ambassador for “a long period.”
                            According to the memorandum, “In return for deleting certain non-policy
                            passages of some witnesses, and for deferring publication of the
                            transcript until after the Philippine elections, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> had agreed to make no
                            substantial cuts in the transcript, in clear violation of White House
                            guidelines.” (Ibid., Subject Files, Box 398, <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                                >Symington</persName> Subcommittee, Vol. I)</note> In my opinion the
                        result of such publication, even two weeks from now after Philippine
                        elections, will be an unmitigated disaster in terms of basic <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests in this country and the future of
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Philippine relations.</p>
                    <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0468"/>
                    <p>2. Beyond this I am deeply disturbed by the broader issue of principle
                        involved in the implications of these proceedings as they seem to question,
                        and publicly so, the control of the conduct of our foreign relations. Staff
                        members of the committee prior to the hearings visited the Philippines and
                        other countries of Southeast Asia and on the instructions of the Departments
                        of State and Defense were provided with the most sensitive and highly
                        classified information on virtually every aspect of our political-military
                        relationships. Senior military and civilian officers summoned home from the
                        field were the principal witnesses before the Subcommittee. These witnesses
                        testified in good faith and spoke frankly in executive session on a series
                        of highly delicate matters. They were continually pressed for personal
                        opinions and judgments on policy decisions reached on the highest level of
                        the United States Government and on conditions in the Republic of the
                        Philippines and actions of its senior officials. They provided without
                        reservation details of classified agreements with the Government of the
                        Philippines.</p>
                    <p>3. The subcommittee is now apparently about to publish this testimony and, as
                        I understand it, is setting itself as the final judge on what will be
                        released. With an unfriendly committee controlling the proceedings it is
                        inevitable that a distorted and unbalanced picture will emerge.</p>
                    <p>4. This applies not just to the Philippines but also to the other countries
                        covered by the Committee's inquiries. It becomes particularly important at
                        this time when you are engaged in the difficult task of shaping future
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>5. I am also concerned about what this will be taken to imply with respect to
                        the sanctity of confidential agreements between governments and our ability
                        to enter into them in the future. Also, other Asian nations will be looking
                        at this to see how we treat our former ward. They will reason that if we
                        treat Filipinos this way they can expect worse when their turn comes.</p>
                    <p>6. There are other matters of considerable importance involved here. The most
                        senior military and civilian staff members in several missions abroad are
                        going to be faced with critical quotations attributable to them specifically
                        by name in the press of their host countries. It is not at all inconceivable
                        that public png cases may result. In other cases the effectiveness of these
                        officers may be so impaired that termination of assignments would seem in
                        order. To a lesser extent it is possible that the effectiveness of your
                        Ambassadors in these various countries may be impaired in a guilt by
                        association sort of way in that senior staffs would be expected to reflect
                        the views of their bosses.</p>
                    <p>7. As you know, the Filipino is hyper-sensitive to foreign criticism,
                        particularly when it comes from the former colonial power. This goes <pb
                            n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0469"/>not just for the super nationalists
                        but for our friends as well. We are already under heavy fire for the
                        acquittal of a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> sailor for shooting a
                        Filipino at one of our bases. The violent reaction here to the relatively
                        calm criticism of Eugene Black provides ample evidence of the explosion
                        which will occur if the committee's hearings are published in their present
                        form.</p>
                    <p>8. We are faced with a trying and difficult series of negotiations regarding
                        our bases, our mutual defense arrangements, and our trade agreements, which
                        we had hoped would normalize, and actually improve, our relationship for
                        some time to come. Publication of the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                            >Symington</persName> hearings as they now stand will be taken as a
                        clumsy attempt to signal future <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy and
                        tactics in these discussions. It will play into the hands of those who are
                        working against us and cost us most of our friends. It could eventually cost
                        us the bases themselves.</p>
                    <p>9. At this critical stage in our economic relations there is also likely to
                        be a destructive fallout in terms of our business interests. I am certain
                        that the New York business community, with nearly a billion dollar of
                        private investment here, would be extremely active in Washington just now if
                        they realized what this may do to our coming efforts to negotiate away
                        uncertainties here that are already plaguing them. Unfortunately they will
                        not fully realize this until after publication when it is already too
                        late.</p>
                    <p>10. Some of what is contained in these hearings needs to be said to the
                        Philippine Government. But how we say it and when is the business of the
                        Executive Branch. This is not the way to do it. It will make it that much
                        harder, if not impossible, to say it properly later on.</p>
                    <p>11. I realize it may be most difficult to try to walk the cat back at this
                        stage. At the same time I do not think the Committee's hired staff has
                        played fair with the information thus far given it in confidence. Indeed I
                        am informed that the local representative of the Reader's Digest claims to
                        have already received a copy of the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>12. In short I am asking that this whole matter be reviewed once more<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">Telegram 11375 elicited concern in Washington and

                            minor adjustments, it was too late to make substantial changes in the

                            relationship with the Subcommittee and would not preclude the testimony
                            getting into public print in a distorted and possibly far more harmful
                            manner.” <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> also asked for
                            Erlichman's “written judgment as to the suitability of the course of
                            action laid out in the proposed State reply.” (Ibid.)</note> in view of
                        its very serious implications. One would hope that the Senate leadership

                        they could fully understand its almost certain damaging consequences of
                        serious proportions. If this is impossible a lesser alternative, undoubtedly
                        still damaging, but far less so, would be for the subcommittee to release
                        its findings on the hearings in its own report and in its own words, with
                        the volumes of actual testimony remaining classified and non-releaseable to

                        the possible effects of publication of such sideswiping material. If nothing
                        else can be done, please consider finding some manner of disassociating the

                    <p>1. Long struggle over transcript of <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                            >Symington</persName> Subcommittee hearings on Philippines—in which
                        State and Defense representatives were in almost daily contact with
                        Sub-committee staff—culminated last night (November 10) in hour and half
                        meeting I had with Senator <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0471"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>. The Senator accepted the
                        exclusion of considerable additional material from his proposed public
                        edition of the transcript. At the conclusion of our meeting I told him that,
                        with these further exclusions I could say that we had no further objection
                        on national security grounds to the publication of this material. <hi
                            rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>
                        </hi>—in making this latter statement we have not indicated that we welcome
                        or approve publication of the remaining material, nor have we even indicated
                        that we do not still regret its publication. If reaction to the publication
                        should require it, we will be in a position to say in fact that we did not
                        approve and that we regret. <hi rend="italic">End <gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                                >FYI</gloss>
                        </hi>.</p>
                    <p>2. The additional material to be excluded from publication was: (a) All
                        references to B–52 flights from Okinawa—of great importance to our relations
                        with Japan. (b) The entire [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>] testimony except for one paragraph in which
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] explains that certain information he has provided
                        consists largely of unsupported and unsubstantiated allegations and one
                        paragraph in which [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] gives his description of “an atmosphere of general
                        lawlessness… throughout the area surrounding Clark Air Base.” A total of
                        some 20 pages of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] material will be removed from the published
                        transcript and replaced simply by the notation “20 pages (deleted).” (c)
                        Virtually all of the passages in the testimony of the witnesses which could
                        be embarrasing to them or imperil their effectiveness in performing their
                        official functions in the Philippines. (d) Some remaining passages which
                        were too prematurely revealing of our tentative internal planning for
                        anticipated future developments or contingencies.</p>
                    <p>3. During my meeting with Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                            >Symington</persName> I also pointed out certain statements by the
                        Sub-committee members which would have an adverse impact because they would
                        be deeply resented by Filipinos. I asked that serious consideration be given
                        to deleting these passages. I understand that some of these will be edited
                        at least, but we don't know what the Sub-committee will finally do about the
                        others.</p>
                    <p>4. Dick Usher will be communicating to you the revised portions and passages
                        of the transcript which now will additionally be excluded. As we have
                        already cabled you, the Senator will delay his release of the transcript for
                        another week, and presumably also his press conference, since his concept of
                        his press conference has been that he would hold it only after the press had
                        had a few days to read the embargoed transcript.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> reported that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> was already planning to issue a statement on
                        November 15 which would cover the points State wished to be made; namely,
                        that these allowances had been paid by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        in order to prevent diversion of Philippine resources from badly needed
                        internal development programs. However, it emerged from the conversation
                        that <persName>Marcos</persName> had not felt under any obligation to use
                        the funds we gave him for the <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>
                        directly, but had actually used it for purposes such as “security matters.”
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> mentioned in this connection the expenses
                        involved in Philippine peacemaking efforts, travels of emissaries (he
                        mentioned Paris and Hanoi), and efforts in South Vietnam to make contact
                        with the Viet Cong, etc. <persName>Marcos</persName> left <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> with the impression that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would try to portray himself as an Asian
                        leader who, like President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, had
                        always been striving for peace in Vietnam and who also had engaged in
                        activities such as those revealed by the President in his November 3
                            speech.<note n="4" xml:id="d198fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic"

                        November 15 statement. It seems highly possible, though, that some of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' machinations may indeed be <pb n="424"
                            xml:id="pg_424" facs="0473"/>revealed. If so, this would be embarrassing
                        to the President, since <persName>Marcos</persName> might try to make it
                        appear that his efforts to contact the North Vietnamese were done with the
                        President's consent, and also would be embarrassing to State if it appeared
                        that the money which we gave to <persName>Marcos</persName> in support of
                        the <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> was used for other purposes.
                        On this latter issue, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName>
                        called in Philippine Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEV1"
                            >Lagdameo</persName> and in my presence explained the problems which use
                        of our funds for purposes not connected with Philippine economic development
                        or allied projects would cause for us with respect to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> Subcommittee. What nobody
                        appeared to notice, or at least wanted to mention, was the possibility that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> used the funds given him for his own
                        personal political activities. As you know, one reason he gave for recalling
                        the <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> was that the Philippine
                        Congress did not vote any funds for its support. This could turn out to be a
                        real mess for everybody.</p>

                                >Kissinger</persName> in a November 25 memorandum, that

                            security and intelligence operations too classified to discuss. He did

                    <p>11818. 1. I had opportunity yesterday with <persName>Marcos</persName> alone
                        to discuss in general terms our approaches to forthcoming negotiations. My
                        remarks followed very closely the previous discussion with Romulo reported
                        in detail Manila 11149<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">Dated October 24.
                            (Ibid.)</note> and in interest of brevity I will not repeat herein my
                        opening remarks. They were perhaps more sharply focused this time on the
                        dangers involved in negotiating through the press with large and
                        high-ranking negotiating panels.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName>Marcos</persName> in general, like Romulo, said most of the
                        things that I wanted him to say but seemed to have more apparent conviction
                        than had Romulo. He said he had already taken some steps in this direction
                        by telling the main members of the panel that he personally was going to
                        make the decisions and that he did not want each of them playing the press
                        in his own behalf. He went so far at one point as to speculate that perhaps
                        we should not start out negotiations with publicly known meetings at all,
                        but have the members of the technical panels meet quietly to see how far
                        they could get before higher levels become involved.</p>
                    <p>3. I found general approach of <persName>Marcos</persName> quite encouraging.
                        He said they were not really prepared as yet to handle matters of such
                        importance and he wanted to put a damper on any idea of “immediate” talks.
                        He said he felt that February was really too soon and at one time mentioned
                        mid-summer. He also said that he thought we should allow time for passions
                        to cool down and hoped for a better atmosphere under which to conduct the
                        talks. He said he had told the policy council that he wanted no more
                        statements about Americans being evicted either from the bases or from their
                        economic interests in the Philippines. He also said he did not want to push
                        us on matters on which we on our side might not be ready. He made reference
                        in this regard to trade policy and evidenced some concern over President's
                        recent speech re Latin America.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he was making Defense Secretary Mata head
                        of the technical panel on military matters, assisted by Alex Melchor. It was
                        interesting that he remarked that if Mata did not remain in the cabinet he
                            <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0475"/>would be replaced on the panel
                        by General Yan. I told him I thought this was very good, as, while we might
                        not necessarily agree, it would be very easy for us to quickly understand
                        each other with such personalities.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName>Marcos</persName> at one point mentioned Washington in
                        connection with Laurel–Langley discussions. He also at one time referred to
                        the desirability to wait a while before getting into such touchy subjects as
                        “vested rights” on the part of American business here. His remarks on this
                        subject could have implied that he preferred a negotiated settlement on this
                        issue as he once referred to what proportion of present American holdings
                        (presumably land) would be a fair and equitable settlement. I am not sure
                        just what he meant on this and there was not time to explore further.</p>
                    <p>6. I mentioned the problem of negotiating on some of these matters with the
                        prospects of constitutional changes hanging over our heads due to the coming
                        convention in 1971. <persName>Marcos</persName> said this was indeed a
                        matter that concerned him. He said he sometimes thought it might be better
                        to delay completion of some of our negotiations until we could see what the
                        composition of the convention delegates would be. He said that once he could
                        look at the slate of delegates he felt he could almost know in advance what
                        they would come up with. I jokingly remarked that he would have me at a
                        disadvantage there as he could make such a judgment while I could not.</p>
                    <p>7. While all of <persName>Marcos</persName>' remarks indicated that he wanted
                        delayed, quiet, and sober approaches to be made on all items of negotiation
                        between us for the sake of eventually arriving at a sound and durable basis
                        for our future relationships, I have a feeling that something unsaid was
                        also on his mind. The Philippines are in a desperate financial situation and
                        he, of course, is fully aware and conscious of their predicament. I think,
                        repeat think, he will hope that we can go into a quiet period without new
                        issues between us for a while in the hopes of our financial assistance. On
                        my part I hope he may try to tamper down reaction here to the forthcoming
                        release of the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> testimony
                        with this in mind.</p>
                    <p>8. It probably will appear that his super-active moves of this week (<gloss
                            target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>, today's coming statement on
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>, etc.) give a contrary
                        impression to my above analysis. Please bear in mind, however, that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' motives as of today is to do almost
                        anything he can think of in order to dominate press coverage and get Osmena
                        and <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> charges and accusations re the
                        elections off page one of the press. Please bear this in mind over the next
                        few days as you judge his moves and statements.</p>

                        Ref: State 198599<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">In telegram 198599 to Manila,
                            November 26, the Department expressed bewilderment at Philippine
                            Presidential Press Secretary Tatad's November 20 press statement that
                            “Philippines has received no ‘payments of any kind in support of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> or its personnel.’” It
                            advised <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> to “let
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> know that we foresee trouble with this”
                            and that “it is most important that <persName>Marcos</persName> not
                            reiterate these statements in face of contrary testimony from Hearings.
                            If pressed, he must continue to support official testimony as it appears
                            in the transcript.” The Department then proposed a scenario in which
                            U.S. payments would be described as offset-type funds: “The funds which
                            the United States did provide to cover the costs of overseas allowances
                            for <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> went directly to the
                            Philippine Government. These offset funds made it possible for the
                            Philippine Government to provide for this contingent without curbing
                            important domestic programs.” (Ibid.)</note> and 199807.<note n="3"

                            stating that he did not think that U.S. accounting of the amount of the

                    <p>1. Regret delay in replying to State 198599. It arrived during my absence at
                        Baguio, and senior staff here so unanimous in feeling suggested second
                        démarche to <persName>Marcos</persName> on subject would be so
                        counterproductive that they decided to await my return. I share view and
                        hope you can satisfy your requirements at home on this subject through
                            <persName corresp="#p_LEV1">Lagdameo</persName> and Melchor. If you feel
                        strongly otherwise, I will of course see <persName>Marcos</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0477"/>
                    <p>2. A peripheral reason for my reluctance is that almost without exception I
                        have tried to handle some aspect of <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                            >Symington</persName> Report in each visit I have had with him. It is by
                        now a sore and dreary subject.</p>
                    <p>3. A far more important reason is that I think he would feel that I was
                        returning to suggest a formula to him which I had previously given him. When
                        I saw him on November 14 I suggested that he might want to handle the
                        subject matter involved in a statement before actual release of the
                        testimony based on the various reported leaks out of the Committee. I
                        suggested that he might note that expenses of the operation were
                        overburdening as far as the Philippine Government was concerned, and that he
                        had felt it necessary to mitigate these extraordinary costs in same manner
                        as some other troop contributing countries by accepting <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> offer to pick up expenses for equipment and
                        supplies for <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> in Vietnam and to
                        offset costs of necessary special overseas allowances by other arrangements.
                        I suggested that he could also say that he and we had felt it in our mutual
                        interests to accelerate normal deliveries of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> military assistance for badly needed domestic Philippine
                        programs. I told him that the testimony would show that these latter were
                        unconnected so far as he was concerned with <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1"
                            >PHILCAG</gloss> itself but were needed on their own merits for mutually
                        agreed objectives in promoting meritorious Philippine domestic programs.
                        After suggesting the above, I left it in written form with him for his
                        consideration. Your new formula is somewhat better now that the text is
                        public but it does not seem sufficiently so to make any great
                        difference.</p>
                    <p>4. I am equally concerned about dangers in the formula you suggest if we
                        press it upon him too hard. I feel sure that <persName>Marcos</persName> at
                        this point would not be willing to make such a statement and let it go at
                        that because it will raise anew the unsettled question as to “where the
                        money went.” I feel he would almost certainly add a long and detailed (and
                        exaggerated) account of expenditures involved in heretofore secret attempts
                        to serve as peace maker on Vietnam. This would be unfortunate in my opinion
                        and would leave things no better off than they were.</p>
                    <p>5. We here find it difficult to understand why you place so much importance
                        on this particular point. The public record is quite specific on the
                        question of funds and the word of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        Executive Branch officials will be generally accepted here, even though
                            <gloss target="#t_GAO1">GAO</gloss> has the problem now in Washington.
                        To that extent it seems to us that <persName>Marcos</persName> has a problem
                        far greater than we do. But Filipinos are not noted for and do not expect

                        things remain as fuzzy as they are at present and to ride it out. To that
                        extent, if we are searching for precision, we are definitely at cross

                        It was rather the biting and sarcastic approach to the Philippines and
                            <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> itself by the two Senators
                        involved and particularly <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>'s

                        nothing but hired mercenaries.” He might be reminded that his approach was a

                        damage done here by this whole exercise. We may be somewhat over the hump on
                        the first issue which was <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>. It
                        drew the first attacks because it was the first item reaching here through
                        press reporting in the States. The fact that that reporting was distorted
                        and superficial only served to make it worse. We are now starting up the
                        second hump as the local press has finally had actual texts long enough to
                        start dealing with the remainder of the report.</p>

                            election “so effectively or so broadly,” and that the Philippines “was

                            States and “wanted to talk to the right people.” (Ibid.)</note> you

                        foresee no immediate increase in the likelihood of revolution, an awfully
                        strong word. Most of the talk about revolution and even assassination has
                        been coming from the defeated opposition, of which Adevoso is a leading
                        activist, and must be weighed in that light.</p>

                            <persName>Marcos</persName>. We know that <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        has been aware for some time of Adevoso's involvement in such plotting. The

                    <p>3. I fully agree that we should protect the U.S. in all ways possible from
                        accusations of collusion with any and all plotters, and I am sure, but will
                        reiterate it to them, that all country team members and the military are
                        aware of this danger. I will also see to it that Adevoso's normal American
                        contacts are especially alert. At the same time, I feel it would be wrong to
                        cut ourselves off completely from the waning opposition in this country,
                        [garble] the initiative for contact comes from them. Sometimes, as I think I
                        did with Osmena, we can even dampen their emotions a bit.<note n="4"

                    <p>35889. For Ambassador from <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Department has recently received from the White House for appropriate
                        action a hand-written notation by the President indicating his interest in
                        cutting U.S. personnel on Clark <gloss target="#t_AFB1">AFB</gloss> by 50%
                        and overall in the Philippines by 25%. The notation was made on a copy of a
                            study<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">Not found.</note> which had been
                        submitted to the President showing the distribution of contract employees of
                        the U.S. military bases. It is likely the percentages refer to overall
                        personnel; they might refer only to military personnel. In any event they
                        suggest the order of magnitude of his present thinking.</p>
                    <p>2. This raises a point covered in your talk with the President in San
                        Clemente. In reviewing your letter to me of August 21, 1969,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d203fn3">Not found.</note> I note that the President spoke to
                        you among other things of the necessity to cut down the American presence in
                        the Philippines, and that he asked if you could give him a report by January
                        containing your broad recommendations on policy and personnel. I have
                        informed the White House that we would prefer to handle the matter within
                        the overall context of the President's request to you, of course taking into
                        consideration this indication his current views. It would be particularly
                        useful if you could let us have in regular channels <gloss
                            target="#t_NODIS1">Nodis</gloss> on a priority basis at least your
                        preliminary views about the desirability of reducing our presence and how
                        this might best be done.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">See <ref target="#d204"
                                >Document 204</ref> for <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                                >Byroade</persName>'s response.</note> Of course, you should take
                        into account the feasibility of bringing about these reductions on a phased
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>3. We have made some rough calculations here as to the numbers of people
                        involved. Figures available here show a total U.S. American military
                        presence in the Philippines of 50,863 made up of 27,423 military personnel,
                        1,443 civilians and 21,997 dependents. Of this Clark <pb n="432"
                            xml:id="pg_432" facs="0481"/>alone accounts for a total of 32,916
                        comprising 16,968 military personnel, 737 civilian employees, and 15,211
                        dependents. From these figures it emerges a 50% cut at Clark would in itself
                        constitute a cut of more than 25% of the total American military presence in
                        the Philippines. We do not have figures available which would show changes
                        either up or down in American military presence since December 31, 1967
                        which was the eve of the BALPA in Embassy personnel. However, our figures on
                        the Embassy and its component missions show a cut in American personnel from
                        700 as of December 31, 1967 to an authorized strength of 494 as of December
                        31, 1969 representing a 29.4% cut.</p>
                    <p>4. Your early response to this cable will be invaluable to us in the context
                        of memoranda which we would be preparing here for the White House on this
                        matter.</p>

                        made out here, it seems to me that the message would have to go to the
                        Pentagon, and they would have to decide how they would have to reorganize
                        their forces in order to meet the requirement. The final decision would then
                        have to be made taking into account the effects of this on our strategic
                        posture, as well as the views of the Department on what the effect of cuts
                        of this magnitude would have in the Philippines. The latter could properly
                        include from us the effect of such cuts on our overall relations with the
                        Phils, their economic impact, etc.</p>
                    <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0482"/>
                    <p>I see no way for me to even approach the initial problem of the proposed 50
                        percent cut at Clark. It is true that the base is on Philippine soil, but
                        what we are really talking about is a drastic cut in the 13th Air Force with
                        headquarters and support staff and many of its operating units at Clark but
                        which, in actuality, extends from Taiwan to Thailand. One needs to get into
                        what units, activities, and capabilities of the 13th Air Force would have to
                        be reduced, or abandoned, and how this would fit into the picture with the
                        present situation in Vietnam and our future national posture in the Far
                        East. Exactly the same type of problem would be involved in a similar, even
                        if reduced, reduction at Subic, substituting only the Seventh Fleet for the
                        13th Air Force and such matters as to where its future center of gravity and
                        maintenance facilities should be. And we should not forget in the process
                        that we are talking about very expensive facilities indeed, which if
                        transferred elsewhere would be very costly. I realize that I am probably
                        over-simplifying the matter because I do not know in just what context this
                        all occurred, but it looks to be like initial action on this, at least,
                        would have to be transferred to the Pentagon. State should of course have
                        its voice, but I really think not an initial one as its role, or at least it
                        seems to me, should be after the initial military appraisal.</p>
                    <p>We could, I suppose, volunteer through normal channels what the economic and
                        political effect of cuts of this magnitude would mean in the Philippines,
                        but I would feel much easier about it if we had a normal channel request to
                        do so. The reason I feel this way is that I can not believe that cuts of
                        this magnitude are consistent with our best interests, and I therefore have
                        no reason to raise the prospects of such an eventuality.<note n="3"

                        thought out strategic plan of our posture in the Pacific of some years hence
                        might not indicate reductions of this magnitude, and I would personally be
                        glad if they could. But I really do think that it must be approached from
                        that direction and not from the direction of cutting bases by name by
                        specific percentages. The latter type of approach is merely the question of
                        swinging the pendulum back, and when done for that reason alone, all past
                        experience shows that it tends to swing too far and too fast, and that it
                        has been costly to get it back to where it belongs.</p>
                    <p>I would as well in such a volunteered message have to say that I believed
                        that both the political and economic effects in the Philippines <pb n="434"
                            xml:id="pg_434" facs="0483"/>would be adverse,<note n="4"

                            to public opinion.” (Ibid.)</note> so I would in effect be giving the
                        appearance of raising a straw man and then shooting him down. On the
                        political level I think it would hurt our position here. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is very sound policy but
                        unfortunately its press treatment and, more importantly, actions in the
                        Senate have local leaders concerned that in effect it is a policy of cutting
                        and running beyond what the nations out here believe to be in their best
                        interests. I would guess the Vice President will have a most important
                        report on this aspect of the situation when he finishes his tour. And on the
                        economic front only a brief but important point. I know we can't let this be
                        a big factor in any decision to retain bases abroad. But it is a very
                        important factor here at present. If the Phils should keep on the recent
                        path of better policies, they would still need help. What better way to do
                        it than by utilizing facilities of theirs which are useful to us.<note n="5"

                            and concluded that the Philippine economy would be hurt by the loss of
                            foreign exchange income, reduced economic activity, and a presumed
                            reduction of Philippine employment at the bases. It added that the $57
                            million reduction “would theoretically cut back Philippine economic
                            activity by $171 million,” using the standard multiplier of three
                            effect, and that this “would be equivalent to about 2 per cent of the

                        that letter could have been misunderstood. As it actually happened, when the

                        January, it was clear to me at the time that he had in mind a report on the
                        general situation here containing broad policy recommendations. We were not
                        at that moment focusing on the reduction-in-presence theme as the letter

                        come home briefly on consultations some time in the next few weeks in order
                        to be better equipped to handle the forthcoming talks with

                    <p>132. We here are, as I am sure you can guess, in the midst of one of our
                        occasionally delicate times. In the past few days I guess I have been
                        spending more time trying to steer us through the present situation rather
                        than reporting it.</p>
                    <p>When I saw <persName>Marcos</persName> the morning after the January 26
                        riots, he opened the conversation by saying how much he had looked forward
                        that morning to seeing me. (We had arranged to meet on the 27th for a
                        general talk when neither of us knew, of course, of the coming riots at
                        Congress.) He said he had not slept much the night before, admitting that
                        the demonstrations and riots had come as a jolt to him. He said he had been
                        jolted further when some of his intelligence types late the night before had
                        attempted to convince him that the U.S. had been implicated in the riots. He
                        said he had seen pieces of paper which implicated Colonel Patterson, Dave
                        Sternberg and Al Ravenholt.</p>
                    <p>He told me that we personally doubted these reports implicating Americans,
                        but it was a factor nevertheless if people were talking about it around
                        town. I told him that I had heard rumors about Patterson before and had
                        thoroughly investigated his activities and had instructed him personally as
                        to how to avoid future misunderstandings. I said I was thoroughly convinced
                        that, if Patterson was guilty of anything, it was no more than having a
                        sympathetic face.</p>
                    <p>I reminded <persName>Marcos</persName> that just after elections I had heard
                        reports that Osmena was talking about rash things. I told him that I thought
                        it best to go try and calm Osmena down and felt that I had at least
                        accomplished something in my two hour talk with him. I told him at the time
                        that I had asked that word reach him indirectly as to what I was trying to
                        do. He said he remembered that and was grateful.</p>
                    <p>I told him that the policy of the U.S. was absolutely firm in the matter
                        under discussion, and that was that the U.S. would in no way attempt any
                        interference in the internal affairs of the Philippines, and that this was
                        fully understood by my staff. We did, however, face a practical problem. It
                        was an old game in the Philippines for politicians and others to claim
                        American support and backing. I was sure he knew that people did
                        occasionally approach us. It seemed also obvious that <pb n="436"
                            xml:id="pg_436" facs="0485"/>they were doing a lot of loose talking
                        around town. Under these conditions if I released specific personnel without
                        cause, nothing really would be accomplished because a new set of names would
                        crop up in the future.</p>
                    <p>I told him I would do two things: 1) talk to sensible opposition leaders and
                        let them know in passing, and of course with no mention of our talk, what
                        the policy of the U.S. was, and 2) insure that no officer of mine let any
                        such conversation end in the future without a clear statement that the U.S.
                        policy was firmly against becoming involved in any way.</p>
                    <p>The conversation ended on good notes and I think <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        was, temporarily at least, reasonably reassured.</p>
                    <p>In the wake of the serious demonstrations Saturday<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d205fn2">January 31.</note> night <persName>Kokoy
                            Romualdez</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_RJF1"
                            >Rafferty</persName> on Sunday asking if the Embassy had any thought
                        about what had happened. <persName corresp="#p_RJF1">Rafferty</persName>
                        merely pointed out the obvious that the real damage had been caused by the
                        infiltration of real pros into the study body. <persName corresp="#p_RJF1"
                            >Rafferty</persName> suggested to Kokoy that it might be a good idea if
                        he talked to me. Kokoy checked with <persName>Marcos</persName> and showed
                        up at my house one hour later. We had a good talk and I think Kokoy's later
                        report to <persName>Marcos</persName> was probably helpful. Kokoy was very
                        frank and gave every evidence he felt himself in a friendly and helpful
                        atmosphere. (As you know he is tense and somewhat tongue-tied when he feels
                        himself in the opposite.) He said we had enemies surrounding
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> who were deliberately feeding this stuff to
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon Osmena called me (on what are probably tapped wires)
                        saying he had just returned from useful talks, particularly with Don Kendall
                        in the U.S., and asked if he could come see me. I said of course he could
                        (even though I did not particularly like the timing). Osmena stayed for 2½
                        rather uncomfortable hours. He was obviously happy to see the recent trouble
                        and considered it a vindication of his protest positions over the elections.
                        He furthermore said that this was just the beginning and that further
                        trouble will follow. In the long conversation I let him know that some
                            <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> Party members would find us more
                        cautious around them in the future as they were talking freely around town
                        about contacts and conversations with Americans. I also let him know that
                        the previous policy I had given him after elections about the U.S. position
                        stood firm. I also said I could not see how it would benefit the Liberal
                        Party in the future for them to even think of working side by side with
                        leftist elements causing the trouble.</p>
                    <p>His proposition in general was that all he had tried to convince us of in the
                        past was beginning to become true, and that the great danger <pb n="437"
                            xml:id="pg_437" facs="0486"/>was that things were being set up for a
                        Communist takeover. My position was that he exaggerated that part of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>I asked Osmena if he thought new worries of <persName>Marcos</persName> might
                        make him a better President after the current troubles were over. In essence
                        Osmena said no, because 1) in six months <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        wouldn't be alive and 2) <persName>Marcos</persName> didn't have the courage
                        to see it through, as he would not stand up under pressure from his
                        political cronies.</p>
                    <p>Against all of the above I have a very sensitive report of a meeting which
                        took place about 2 a.m. last night at the Palace. This would indicate that
                        the President and Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> advised several close
                        confidants that they believe the U.S. had in some way had a role in
                        instigating demonstrations against Malacanang. President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' reasoning was that the U.S. desires to keep
                        him off balance in view of the forthcoming U.S./Phil negotiations on
                        Laurel–Langley, bases, etc. President <persName>Marcos</persName> also
                        discussed contingency plans in the event an insurrection in the Manila area
                        was successful. The President apparently said his plans in this event were
                        to move himself and some loyal followers to the Ilocos region where he can
                        regroup his forces.</p>
                    <p>I believe we will be able to weave ourselves through this without something
                        stupid happening, but wanted you to have the background of these three
                        conversations just in case. The real danger, of course, is of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> becoming panicky in his surprise and
                        concern. Hopeful developments as of today is that they have asked us for
                        renewed riot training. We are equipped to do this locally and it is now
                        underway. Also, very trusted security chief in Malacanang has just asked us
                        for advice and possible assistance on getting the type of dye that Germans
                        use effectively for identification purposes in connection with the fire
                        hoses technique of riot control.</p>
                    <p>You must remember in judging all this that we here live in a situation where
                        it is almost inconceivable to the average Filipino that anything ever
                        happens in the Philippines without an American hand being involved
                        somewhere.</p>
                    <p>I will provide you with this type background through this channel to
                        supplement our regular reporting as long as this seems necessary.<note n="3"

                        problem at the moment seems to be one of helping <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        to keep his cool. For this he needs reassurance from us among other things,
                        and for this reason if for no other, I will try to see him soon and will
                        continue to make plain that we are not and will not be involved in these

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Causes</hi>: The proximate cause of the student riots
                        was a student demand that the political parties (i.e. specifically President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>) not influence the elections next November
                        for a Constitutional Convention to frame a new Constitution. With
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' recent overwhelming victory, fears are
                        growing among the students and others that he may perpetuate his power, and
                        that a last chance may be lost to reform Philippine politics.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d206fn2">The President underlined the last two lines of the
                            first paragraph and wrote: “(They need the reform!)”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Liberals, disgruntled by their recent defeat, may have thought it useful
                        to egg on the students to “get even” with <persName>Marcos</persName>. Some
                        of his political competitors in his own party may be trying to generate
                        pressures against a third term. Beyond this is a widespread sense of
                        post-election letdown in the Philippines. The balance-of-payments crisis is
                        tightening, and some people are being hurt by the Government's new austerity
                        measures. In every previous Philippine election, frustrations could be
                        blamed on the President who had just been defeated;
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' unprecedented re-election means that the
                        natural scapegoat is still in office. Frustrations over the venality and
                        lack of direction of Philippine political life have been growing, and some
                        observers believe that church and parental authority was probably
                        sympathetic to the strikers rather than being a restraining influence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">What Happened</hi>: The demonstration was originally
                        organized by a moderate student grouping anxious to keep it peaceful. To
                        avoid violence, they were in the process of dispersing, and their leaders
                        were actually in the Malacanang talking with <persName>Marcos</persName>,
                        when an extremist student group arrived with their supporters, looking for
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>During the period that followed, four or five students were killed, of some
                        15,000–40,000 involved. It was by all odds the largest and most violent
                        demonstration in Philippine history.</p>
                    <p>The violence may have been fanned by professional Communist agitators, but
                        this is still very moot.</p>
                    <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0488"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Reaction</hi>: The principal current reaction is shock
                        and introspection. President <persName>Marcos</persName> has gone on the air
                        and, in an effort to divert attention from the fact that he personally was
                        the target of the students, has blamed the violence upon leaders “influenced
                        by… the ideology of <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>,”
                        and upon Communist and non-Communist conspiracies. He has further magnified
                        the importance of the riot by closing schools for a week.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Implications</hi>: <persName>Marcos</persName> has
                        been put very much on the defensive in a remarkably short time following his
                        election landslide. Popular discontent and political jealousies have
                        focussed on him. It is much too early, however, to say whether he will be
                        seriously weakened, or whether he will be deflected from an effort—which we
                        surmise he has been making—to insure that the Constitutional Convention is
                        malleable to his interests.</p>
                    <p>At its most serious (and fed by current economic troubles), an attack on
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> could expand to an attack on the present
                        political structure, but we have no evidence that the forces with the will
                        and power to press for fundamental changes have coalesced.</p>
                    <p>We may hope that the riots will encourage <persName>Marcos</persName> to put
                        a priority on social and economic reform, but this is by no means
                        certain.</p>
                    <p>At the least, it is reasonably certain that Philippine politics will be
                        inward-turned in coming months. Some journalists have, as usual, blamed the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, but the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> will probably not become a major target, unless the power
                        balance moves sharply to the left. <persName>Marcos</persName> has
                        heretofore tended to monopolize the “nationalist” line, but his decision to
                        blame Communists for his present troubles limits his flexibility to seek
                        better relations with them. Because of the economic importance of good
                        relations with us (and to avoid adding problems with the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to his other problems),
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> will probably move very slowly on opening
                        Military Base Agreement negotiations with us, and will probably seek to
                        continue to defer negotiations on the Laurel–Langley renegotiation.<note

                        “stand behind him.”</p>
                    <p>—He asked advice whether to postpone the Constitutional Convention scheduled
                        for 1971, and about speeded-up deliveries of helicopters and ammunition
                        under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—He complained about the hostility of the Manila press.</p>
                    <p>—He asked why we cannot be more forthcoming with help, and at one point
                        mentioned the figure of $100 million. (We have already turned aside requests
                        for $450 million in stabilization loans over three years, and have pushed

                        from being drawn into this situation. He tried discreetly to suggest the
                        need for social programs and land reform, and to head off drastic actions
                        such as martial law.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">A marginal note in

                        soothsayers' predictions that he will die before June. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> himself thinks that the situation
                        may get worse (the next student demonstration is scheduled for February 12,
                        and there is a chance that labor may join it). <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> thinks that <persName>Marcos</persName>' best course
                        would be to make a sweep of the Cabinet and to embark upon such reforms as
                        he can afford. He <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0490"/>points out,
                        however, that a Philippine President who moved too fast might well be

                    <p>Separately, <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> makes a plea for
                        the return to the Philippines of an American soldier who was allowed to slip
                        out of the Philippines while in U.S. custody awaiting a Philippine trial. He
                        thinks this issue (coming on top of another similar incident) could become
                        explosive to our relations if the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> should
                        endeavor to exploit it to divert attention from its own problem. At the

                    </p>
                    <p>1. We commend way you handled delicate conversation with
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, avoiding being drawn into position of
                        giving him advice as to specific decisions he faces, while at same time
                        being willing to discuss with him nature of problems with which he is now
                        confronted. We agree that it is desirable for you to continue to maintain
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' confidence. Your conversations with him
                        will provide an opportunity for you, without making any specific
                        recommendations, to review events and show the pros and cons of various
                        possible courses of action. Such talking out of the issues should also help
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> maintain the necessary degree of composure
                        and balance.</p>
                    <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0491"/>
                    <p>2. Believe you should continue to try to maintain this posture during this
                        volatile period of uncertainty as to how the various forces at work are
                        motivated and will operate in the immediate future. We believe we must try
                        to keep the United States as much as possible from being drawn into
                        involvement or appearance of involvement in this crisis. Thus, if you were
                        to give <persName>Marcos</persName> specific advice, he might then let it be
                        known that in his future actions he was acting on American advice, thereby
                        involving us directly. On the other hand, by keeping in touch with him and
                        helping him to analyze his situation as objectively as possible, you may be
                        able at the same time to play a role in restraining him from ill-considered
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>3. The situation requires, more than ever before, that we take every
                        precaution to avoid incidents of any kind which might direct the focus of
                        Philippine unrest and anger against the United States or any elements of its
                        presence in the Philippines. No doubt you will be cautioning U.S. military
                        and civilian components that they must exert extreme care and restraint to
                        prevent incidents involving Americans.</p>
                    <p>4. We here will be doing everything we can to support you and your highly
                        capable team in your best judgments as to how we should proceed.<note n="3"

                    <p>1213. Subj: Call on Romulo.</p>
                    <p>1. I called on Romulo at his request this afternoon. He held in his hand two
                        notes to present to me. As I suspected they were on the subject <pb n="443"
                            xml:id="pg_443" facs="0492"/>of U.S. military leaving the Philippines to
                        evade criminal jurisdiction by the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>2. I opened by saying that in view of our past conversations (nearly daily) I
                        had hoped he would feel that he need not have to give me these notes today.
                        He replied that he felt he had no alternative because he was “sick and
                        tired” of evasion on these issues. He then went into a bit of speech-making
                        which ended up with him asking me point blank what I was going to do about
                            Moomey.<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">Moomey and <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> were U.S. servicemen stationed
                            in the Philippines who were accused of serious crimes, and whom
                            Philippine authorities wished to try in Philippine courts rather than
                            the customary U.S. military courts.</note> I told him that I was not
                        ever going to even try to do anything about Moomey, inasmuch as I was sure
                        he knew, there was nothing I could do about bringing him back. I also told
                        him that I had every hope that <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                            >Williams</persName> would be brought back. I did not see why, when he
                        knew we were in the process of working very hard on this case, which had its
                        complexities in American (as it would in the Philippine) system, that he
                        would feel compelled to make a strong case publicly until the matter could
                        be resolved.</p>
                    <p>3. I did not bother to read his notes, but proceeded to talk to Romulo in the
                        strongest language I believe I have ever used with a foreign minister. I
                        said I recognized the element of sovereignty in these cases which concerned
                        him, but wanted him to know that as far as the real issues were concerned,
                        which included matters of life and death, the exercise he was trying to put
                        me through paled into semantics. I also told him that I could not believe he
                        was fully aware of the things going on around town and feared that he was
                        unwittingly joining into a pattern which seemed to me both serious and
                        sinister.</p>
                    <p>4. I told him I thought there was an obvious effort going on in Manila to
                        divert attention from the government onto the Americans, and this included
                        efforts to divert the rioters and troublemakers as well. I suggested he
                        think long and hard before he engaged in public polemics about us today in
                        view of the anticipated troubles here in Manila tomorrow. There were rumors
                        around town that there would be an indiscriminate attempt to kill some
                        Americans in connection with the demonstrations scheduled for tomorrow. I
                        felt these were serious enough that as a precaution I was making
                        considerable effort to keep Americans in their homes tomorrow, even though I
                        regretted taking this step as it might in a way contribute to the feeling of
                        unease of everyone here. It was for this reason that I have made all my
                        moves in this regard as low-keyed as possible.</p>
                    <p>5. I also told him that the charges that he was leveling against us for
                        infraction of rules around the bases paled even more into insignificance
                        when one considered the security situation around these bases.</p>
                    <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0493"/>
                    <p>I told him I thought I would be ready soon to present him with facts that I
                        was sure neither he nor the President knew about. In addition to the normal
                        graft and corruption and straight malfeasance of justice situations which
                        had long existed, things were now taking a more serious turn. It appeared to
                        me that a pattern might be developing of periodic, indiscriminate killing of
                        Americans. I said he could not accept forever that publicity would come only
                        from him or his side, and that I might have to start speaking out publicly
                        on these matters. I gave him four or five lurid cases which I must admit had
                        even Romulo speechless.</p>
                    <p>6. I said he might likewise not know that he was planning this public attack
                        on us at the very time that I was working closely with President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> in an effort to be helpful to him and the
                        government in their current crisis.</p>
                    <p>7. Romulo interrupted and said that he wished he had talked to me earlier as
                        he had already given the notes and comments to one afternoon newspaper. I
                        said in that case I guess it was even too late to see the President, and my
                        only recourse was to consider what I might myself do publicly.</p>
                    <p>8. Romulo jumped up and went into his adjoining office and came back with the
                        material he had planned to use in the press conference after my departure.
                        He threw it on his desk and said, “There it all is. I won't give out any
                        more to the press and I will see what I can do to tone down what I have
                        already done.”<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">Telegram 1243 from Manila,
                            February 12, reported that the “scathing tone reflected in February 11”
                            newspapers was “nowhere to be found February 12,” and that the morning
                            dailies had “temperate stories.” (National Archives, <persName

                        the things I had told him and wanted me to know personally that his intended
                        action had been at his own initiative and he did not want me to think that
                        he was joining others to turn Filipinos against us at this time.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I think that the latter is probably true
                        and that Romulo, for purposes of his own shaky position and prestige, had
                        decided that this was a good time for him to weigh in. There will be another
                        staff cable enroute on these cases. I see now that his note complains about

                        the Embassy was not informed of either this case or <persName

                            characterized this telegram as “some effective bare-knuckle diplomacy by

                            that Romulo had intended to present the protest notes and then report
                            the whole affair to the press, which would have stirred up anti-American
                            sentiment and diverted attention from <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                            problems with the students. He reported that “<persName

                    <p>1393. Subj: Conversation with <persName>Marcos</persName> on Central
                        Luzon.</p>
                    <p>1. I took departing <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Director Haraldson to
                        say goodbye to <persName>Marcos</persName> yesterday and the latter asked me
                        to remain afterwards for a private talk.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he was going to clean up Central Luzon
                        once and for all. He wanted to start the process within the next thirty
                        days, but he wanted to know first whether he would have our support. I asked
                        what he had in mind, and he quickly pointed out that all he had in mind was
                        for us to supply military items. He said he was worried about the level of
                        ammunition for his armed forces, the need for more <gloss target="#t_M161"
                            >M–16</gloss>'s and helicopters. I reminded him that we were momentarily
                        in the process of bringing side arm ammunition up to date. He said he
                        appreciated our quick action in this particular matter.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName>Marcos</persName> said that all eyes were focused on Manila
                        whereas the real impetus for many of the troubles in Manila, and the real
                        danger for the future, lies in Central Luzon. He said training camps were
                            <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0495"/>being set up in extremely
                        inaccessible spots. He mentioned one that appeared being set up for about
                        100 men and another for 300 and that if he tried to drop 50 troopers in
                        these areas using his present 5 helicopters they would be wiped out. He said
                        any support that these camps were getting at this point from outside sources
                        was negligible, but it looked like subversive forces were being formed
                        which, when in being, might expect outside support.</p>
                    <p>4. He then dwelled at some length over the perennial disagreement here
                        between his people and our <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> over
                        the level of supply of ammunition that should be in Philippine hands. (This
                        has indeed been a problem over the years and it has often appeared to our
                        people that it is more emotional than logical. We hope this problem will
                        eventually be solved when their own ammunition factory comes into operation
                        in late 1971. In the meantime, I think in judging them on this score we must
                        be conscious of the psychological factors involved in having one's source of
                        ammunition in foreign hands.)</p>
                    <p>5. What <persName>Marcos</persName> is asking for in effect is quick action
                        on our part on some initial supply items so that he could plan his
                        operations well prior to the beginning of the rains, and in addition to that
                        some proof that we would continue to stand behind them for replenishment of
                        used items. All this, of course, gives us quite a problem. In its broadest
                        aspects I suppose he is trying to prove once again to himself that we will
                        support him, but even more broader still may be putting us to the test on
                        the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine,<note n="2"

                            while the United States would honor its commitments and help its allies,
                            Asian countries would bear the main burden of defending
                            themselves.</note> i.e., the Phils will do the job themselves but will
                        need logistic support.</p>
                    <p>6. It is, of course, very much in our interests that Central Luzon be cleaned
                        up and Communist oriented armed groupings there not be allowed to expand and
                        organize under the umbrella of the current general situation here. We also
                        have to think of the importance of operations at Clark Field and of our
                        people in that area. To take the extreme, the terrain is such that a few
                        hostile mortars in the hills could make for a very difficult situation at
                        Clark.</p>
                    <p>7. One trouble in the past in this situation is that no President since
                        Magsaysay has been willing to tackle the political aspects of changing the
                        situation in Central Luzon. If <persName>Marcos</persName> really means it
                        this time he is going to have to ride rough shod over local politicians of
                        some stature. He is also going to have to move on civic action aspects of
                        the problem and he has, of course, made one move by sending <gloss
                            target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0496"/>to that area, and another by
                        starting air mobile operations in the area using available lift.</p>
                    <p>8. I would like to find some way to satisfy any legitimate concern
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> may have as to our physical support for
                        meaningful items and yet protect us from those that would not really be
                        meaningful. We have already been able to move on some items and this has
                        been very useful to us here. I do believe a few more helicopters makes sense
                        and have recommended we try to find somewhere five more at an early date. I
                        have just sent a message suggesting how we might be able to handle another
                        roughly 1,200 <gloss target="#t_M161">M–16</gloss>'s.</p>
                    <p>9. This leaves the question of the level of supply of ammunition which we
                        will support here. I would like to find some means of meeting this problem,
                        which I would assess as being about half real and half psychological, and do
                        it in a way that would not cost us much money (which we do not have in our
                        program), and also in a way that would give us freedom of action to judge
                        how the Phils perform in this task. It seems to me that there should be some
                        middle course to satisfy these rather somewhat conflicting criteria.</p>
                    <p>10. I have not as yet had time to thoroughly explore this with <gloss
                            target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss>, but am wondering whether we could
                        not move into Subic for storage from depots in Japan or Okinawa an
                        additional increment of supply above the 30 day base for their main line
                        weapons. We would then be in a position to tell <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        that the stuff was close by and could be drawn on as necessary to keep their
                        levels at a satisfactory rate as ammunition was expended. It might be a bit
                        hard to do this without giving the impression that we want to wait to see
                        how he performs. Off hand I would think it could be presented to him
                        primarily as a budgetary device because there was no immediate money in the
                        program available and we would not need any as long as the ammunition was
                        still in our hands/with him, however, knowing that it was close at hand. I
                        am fully aware that any such apparently simple plan would be full of
                        logistical and statistical nightmares but suppose it could be done
                        nonetheless if our overall interests would so dictate.</p>
                    <p>11. We will be exploring these matters further and this message is to give a
                        feeling of things here and to lay the setting for possible future message
                        through both State and Defense channels.</p>

                        was inadvertently allowed by his military supervisors to depart on

                            broke away from a larger demonstration on the night of February 18 and
                            marched to the U.S. Embassy, broke through the outer gates of the
                            complex, and threw rocks and firebombs at the windows. Because there was
                            no police protection at the Embassy, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> telephoned President
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> directly, emphasizing that “the Embassy
                            had no protection. President <persName>Marcos</persName> said he would
                            take care of it right away. Riot police arrived within half an hour and
                            very quickly brought the situation under control.” Several situation
                            reports describe the demonstration in greater detail. (Ibid., Box 556,
                            Country Files, Far East, Philippines, Vol. II)</note> According to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>, two-thirds of the
                        anti-foreign speeches at a mass demonstration prior to the attack on the
                        Embassy referred to the <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                        case, and were used as one means of getting part of the crowd to move to the
                        Embassy.</p>
                    <p>In the period since the confrontations developed between
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> and discontented student groups, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> has been concerned over the
                        possibility that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might get caught in
                        the middle and catch part of the blame for the situation. He feared, in
                        fact, that the Philippine <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0498"
                        />Government might deliberately attempt to draw in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in order to deflect attention from the
                        pressing economic and social issues behind the confrontation with the
                        students. The <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> case impressed
                        him as a perfect vehicle for this purpose, and indeed Foreign Secretary
                        Romulo actually intended to use this ploy but was deterred by some extremely
                        effective bare-knuckle diplomacy by <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName>. I attach (Tab B) a telegram reporting <persName

                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> was able to influence
                        Romulo's behavior to some extent (though the absence of any police
                        protection prior to the attack on the Embassy indicates a degree of
                        Philippine Government duplicity), he was of course in no position to
                        influence the leftists. There are many extremists who would like nothing
                        better than to drag the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> through the mud,
                        and the <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> case has provided a
                        perfect starting point. Filipinos of all descriptions are susceptible to
                        propaganda charging the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> handling of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> case as having violated
                        Philippine sovereignty, especially since this is not the first case of this
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the question of issuing orders to <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                            >Williams</persName> to return, as urgently requested by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>, has become stuck in
                        Defense. State has asked the Air Force to issue the orders on foreign policy
                        grounds, and the Air Force is willing to go along. However, higher authority
                        in Defense is not, and is balking, due both to apprehensions over the
                        prospect of adverse reaction on the Hill, and to the very good chance that
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>, if returned, would not
                        receive a fair trial. Defense also believes that <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                            >Williams</persName> might be able to resist return by seeking a legal
                        writ. I understand that Justice is perfectly willing to take the case
                        through the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> courts if orders are issued to
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> and he employs legal
                        procedures to resist; Justice also believes that it could win the case. It
                        is not willing to take an official position on the matter at this time,
                        though.</p>
                    <p>I believe that you will wish to consider the implications of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> case very carefully. Our position
                        in the Philippines appears to be vulnerable, and if <persName
                            corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> is not returned, our whole
                        relationship with the Philippines could be greatly complicated, including
                        the tenure of our bases. According to our Military Bases Agreement with the
                        Philippines, we have no grounds to keep <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                            >Williams</persName> out of Philippine judicial process, even though
                        some of these processes have typically been bent and stretched by the
                        Filipinos in their handling of this and other cases. On the other hand, the
                        possible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> domestic repercussions,
                        particularly those on the Hill, could be troublesome.</p>
                    <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0499"/>
                    <p>Even returning <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> at this time
                        will not solve our problems, since we will appear to be operating under
                        Philippine pressures rather than honoring our treaty relationship, but we
                        can at least ease the criticisms on this score by claiming that the matter
                        was under review by the appropriate authorities and action has been taken in
                        accordance with standard procedures. Sending <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                            >Williams</persName> back might also help to get us more into the
                        background when Filipino tempers are running high. We could use any
                        breathing-space gained to press the Filipinos for improvements in their
                        judicial handling of criminal cases involving Americans, particularly at
                        Clark Field.</p>

                    <p>I must say this action borders on the ridiculous. This is an incredible
                        reduction in U.S. presence in the Philippines no matter how unnecessary our
                        presence may be. The degree to which our facilities in the Philippines are
                        directly linked to operations in South Vietnam is substantial and no one

                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> of the President's
                            decision to cut personnel at Clark Air Base by one-third and that

                            would have a “detailed” plan for the reductions completed by about April
                            20. In a March 10 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> stated that the plan would call for the personnel

                            initialed his approval. (Both ibid.)</note> calling for a reduction of
                        this magnitude over the time frame cited, I think we will ultimately provide
                        either the biggest laugh in the bureaucracy or shake whatever confidence
                        they may have in our ability to run foreign affairs on a sound and
                        systematic basis. Our job is to prevent the President from making the kinds
                        of mistakes which we know only too well he can make in times of emotional
                        peak. This action fits into that category despite the fact that the
                        President has reiterated his intention of reducing our presence in the
                        Philippines on countless occasions.</p>
                    <p>The Philippine cut, the near 50% reduction in Korea, the precipitous draw
                        down in South Vietnam and Thailand, the All-Volunteer Army ploy, the
                        posturing for an assault on NATO next year, and the 10% across-the-board
                        reduction of our overseas strength already accomplished this year cannot but
                        convince the most amateur observer that despite all of our rhetoric we are
                        adopting a fortress America concept which is not only inward looking but
                        emotionally orchestrated. I think the Korean studies, even though triggered
                        by a capricious directive, at least went through the motions of a clear and
                        systematic interdepartmental review. In that instance the wisdom of
                        reduction was confirmed by that review. We should certainly as a minimum
                        follow a similar procedure on the Philippine issue.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest that you talk to the President about this before signing this
                        memorandum and underline your concern that such a drastic reduction could
                        not but be interpreted as a wholesale bug-out, which will have an
                        incalculable impact on our efforts in Southeast Asia to say nothing of
                        inflicting untold hardships on the economy and people of the Philippines. I
                        also strongly recommend that we accomplish the Philippine reduction as a
                        result of an objective <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> which would
                        initiate the kind of interdepartmental review of the type which we will all
                        have confidence in with the kind of time we need to do it and with careful
                        consideration given to the impact of this reduction on the Vietnam war,
                        Pacific Fleet and air operations and the economic stability of an irritating
                        but nevertheless long-time ally and ward.</p>

                            >Telegram 25196 to Manila, February 19, clarified <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s position to <persName

                                >Green</persName> stated that he was aware that any duty reductions
                            granted to the Philippines “could be made available to other countries.”
                            However, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated: “we do not
                            believe this is a desirable course to pursue” for a number of reasons,
                            the first of which was that the “Filipinos, in their own interest, must
                            come to realize that the development of a sound economic base for their
                            economy is essentially up to them.” (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Your Feb 20 cable causes very grave concern on my part. It comes as quite
                        a shock to learn six months after my arrival (and three months after we
                        reaffirmed our willingness to renegotiate the Laurel–Langley Agreement first
                        expressed in September 1966) that we are prepared to do nothing about our
                        economic arrangements here except let nature take its course. It may be nice
                        theory but it hardly fits the practical world of things, in which the
                        Philippines is presently passing through several long-term crises at the
                        same time (foreign policy, constitution, balance of payments, and economic
                        relations with the U.S.). I also think it is a callous view as regards the
                        degree of protection we should accord to U.S. business abroad, which I feel
                        is a legitimate part of our national interest.</p>
                    <p>2. I don't think I can accept this without a considerable effort on my part
                        to try to change our position. I realize, however, one doesn't win any cases
                        with Washington when things still seem to be on a theoretical basis.
                        Unfortunately, although it may not seem so on the surface, we are in a very
                        real sense even now at the time of decision. The continued uncertainty is
                        exacting an ever-rising toll in the economic realm. If we let things slide,
                        this will mean that sooner or later we will confront the Phils across the
                        table with the news that we really don't have anything to talk about. Their
                        natural reaction will presumably be to take strong punitive measures against
                        U.S.-owned businesses to force us off this position, where upon the latter
                        will descend on the Washington scene in force. I know that there is a
                        feeling in the Department that there is considerable difference in the
                        thinking of local business leaders here and their home offices. Now that I
                        am getting to know both, I think this has been greatly over-exaggerated. Not
                        a week goes by here that I don't see several visiting bigwigs from home
                        offices. I <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0502"/>believe when the issues
                        become defined that New York will at least try to push us to attempt to
                        defend what seems to them to be fair and reasonable.</p>
                    <p>3. I predict that we would then develop a more flexible and imaginative
                        position. The problem will then be, however, that, because of the nature of
                        these issues, the need for legislation, etc., many months will thereafter be
                        required for firm positions to be developed.</p>
                    <p>4. This would I believe be the wrong approach. It would of course exacerbate
                        our military as well as our investment problems. I still hope we can to
                        avoid adhering to such an approach which, I might add, appears to be widely
                        at variance with the approach we are contemplating taking with the
                        Latinos.</p>
                    <p>5. I wish to make clear that I do not recommend anything that might properly
                        be termed a prolonged extension of “special relations.” I do believe however
                        that there is need for general recognition throughout the U.S. Government of
                        the importance and delicacy of the issues involved and of the essentiality
                        of our managing this creeping crisis in the Philippines as painstakingly as
                        we know how. Some flexibility on timing of the phase-out, and ad hoc
                        problems, may be required. In any case, I am convinced that the approach in
                        your message will only increase the perils already inherent in the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>6. If the position outlined in your message eventually remains firm in spite
                        of these considerations, then I think the Department will have an obligation
                        to inform U.S. industry. It would not be fair in my opinion to withhold this
                        position from them and let many of them, who are still hopeful we will get a
                        fair deal for them in negotiations, end up in a fire-sale atmosphere too
                        late to make better arrangements.</p>

                        submitting the plan.</p>

                        reductions should be completed as soon as possible and in no case later than
                        June 30, 1971. The Under Secretaries Committee should consider how they are

                    <p>This study was undertaken as a result of the memorandum from Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to the Under Secretary of State
                        dated October 30 [20]<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">
                            <ref target="#d195">Document 195</ref>.</note>, 1969, on the subject of
                        “Revisions of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Military Bases Agreement
                        with the Philippines.” The memorandum indicated that the President had
                        directed a review of our treaty and other relationships with the Philippines
                        with the objective of:</p>
                    <p>—putting the Philippines on a most-favored-nation basis,</p>
                    <p>—examining the total physical area in the Philippines controlled by the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Forces and the number of bases for
                        comparison with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Forces holdings in
                        other countries. Consideration should be given to the release of land in the
                        Philippines which may be surplus to military needs.</p>
                    <p>The study sets forth objectives and outlines policy assumptions and guidance
                        on which the effort is based. In addition, the Philippine pressures in the
                        last five years, as related to the number and size of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> bases, are discussed in detail. A section of the study is
                        devoted to the size of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bases in the
                        Philippines and in several other countries. Country population, land areas
                        and civilian population densities are compared to the same statistics of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Forces in the various countries.
                        Pertinent information of all the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bases and
                        properties in the Philippines is provided and the need for the properties is
                        discussed. The JOBAR study conclusions relating to the closure of Sangley
                        Point, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> position concerning the study
                        results and the present status of JOBAR recommendations are discussed
                        briefly.</p>
                    <p>The Study conclusions are as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. Although the total land area of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bases in
                        the Philippines is large in comparison to that in other foreign countries, a
                        comparison of <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0505"/>the various
                        population densities does not indicate that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> controls a disproportionate share of land in the
                        Philippines.</p>
                    <p>b. The two Navy <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> squadrons, based on Sangley
                        Point, are involved primarily in Vietnam-related missions. It is envisioned
                        that this ASW force will be reduced to one squadron in the post-Vietnam era.
                        As <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> combat forces are reduced in <gloss
                            target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, it may be desirable to relocate those
                        naval aviation units and support activities now located at Sangley. The
                        JOBAR Study addresses the issue of closure of Sangley in the present time
                        frame. In late January 1970, however, DepSecDef elected against a unilateral
                        decision to close Sangley Point now. This was due, in part, to the utility
                        of the station as a bargaining point in our <gloss target="#t_MBA1"
                            >MBA</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>c. From a review of Clark Air Base holdings, it is considered that the Air
                        Force could relinquish a portion of Zone D acreage without adversely
                        impacting on base expansion requirements, security, or integrity. However,
                        it is believed that this acreage should be released only if the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> presses for a reduction in the size of the
                        Clark holdings.</p>
                    <p>d. Due to its topography, approximately one-half the land in the Subic Bay
                        area is unimproved and is retained primarily for security reasons and to
                        protect the watershed of the area. A portion of this land could be
                        relinquished without adversely affecting the mission of the base provided
                        there is an adequate land use survey.</p>
                    <p>e. John Hay Air Base serves as an important low-cost recreational area for

                        Philippines. The annual savings that would accrue from closing the base is
                        small in comparison to its value in increased morale and productivity of the
                        personnel. It should be retained unless <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>

                            reported <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>'s “shock” at the
                            extent of the personnel cuts to be made in the Philippines and stated
                            that “the implications” of this decision “could not be more profound.”
                            In regard to the 25 percent across the board personnel reduction,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> stated that he felt
                            “strongly that we have passed the point where this is possible. Whole
                            operations and probably some agencies must be taken out to achieve
                            reductions of this magnitude, not crippling cutbacks that will leave me
                            with nothing operating properly.” (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. My guess is that we are just “whistling Dixie” if we think we will have
                        any options left when the time comes to tell the <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> about our scheduled cuts in the Philippines. Yesterday I
                        found that all of the bases here were informed through military channels of
                        current plans for across the board cuts, with percentages provided. No
                        rationale whatsoever was given.</p>
                    <p>2. Throughout all of this I have felt that when the chips were down and the
                        effects, both here and in our support for the area as a whole, were coldly
                        analyzed, that things would begin to fall into place in a more logical
                        manner. I still think this will be the case, but now I wonder how much
                        damage may be created before we reach that point.</p>
                    <p>3. At the very least I suggest you ask the military to follow up their <gloss

                            >CINCPAC</gloss> and its subsequent distribution here with the follow up
                        order that they clam up on this particular subject pending further
                        instructions. This would give your committees and planners time to weigh the
                        consequences prior to any further word to the field.<note n="3"

                    <p>4. In a more philosophical vein I want to pass on along to you, and for the
                        perusal of your sub-committees, a part of a draft policy report from here,
                        not yet finished, that deals with “the American presence.” It is still in
                        draft form, but because of the urgency of the situation, I will send it
                        along as it now is.</p>
                    <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0507"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Begin draft:</p>
                    <p>1. In considering the term “American presence” as it applies to the
                        Philippines, it is useful first to review the current status of this
                        presence:</p>
                    <p>(A) The number of American residents in the Philippines is declining and has
                        been for some time, even though estimates of non <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> connected persons claiming <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> citizenship still run as high at 24,000.</p>
                    <p>(B) The American business community is half the size it was a decade or two
                        ago. With trained and competent Filipinos available it is unnecessary and
                        expensive to maintain a large American staff.</p>
                    <p>(C) The American religious community increased sharply after World War II,
                        but is now declining as Filipino priests and ministers are replacing
                        Americans and other foreigners.</p>
                    <p>(D) Our civilian official strength has been cut back by almost thirty percent
                        in the last eighteen months, and if the reduction in the number of Peace
                        Corps volunteers is included, there has been a fifty percent reduction.</p>
                    <p>(E) Lower levels of military activity in Vietnam, and budgetary limitations
                        have reduced our military strength. We have moved out of Mactan Air Base,
                        and by June of this year military personnel reductions will be slightly over
                        two-thousand.</p>
                    <p>2. The impact of this presence is difficult to measure. For the press critic
                        and student radical in Manila, hostility to the United States is rooted in
                        psychological and historical factors little affected by the number of
                        Americans in the Philippines. In the countryside the respect and admiration
                        for the United States is still so great that the American Ambassador runs
                        the awkward risk of outdrawing the Philippine President. There are well
                        publicized problems around the bases, but with one exception our military is
                        concentrated in two relatively isolated areas in the Philippines, and the
                        social and economic impact in even these areas is by no means all bad. There
                        has certainly been no suggestion from the Philippine Government that there
                        are too many Americans here. On the contrary, the Government is doing all it
                        can to encourage the presence of many more American tourists.</p>
                    <p>3. It is important to recognize that seventy years of close association with
                        the Philippines has bound us together, and that for good or ill, an American
                        presence (in the broadest sense of this term) would remain even if every
                        official American went home. We have established institutions here that took
                        deep root and are now a part of Philippine society, representative
                        government, private enterprise, and freedom of the press. Filipino
                        newspapers would still continue to carry American columnists, American comic
                        strips, and American ball scores. American books, movies, and products would
                        still be favored. Over 4,500 Filipinos went to the United States for
                        education and training last year. Over 16,000 went as visitors.
                        Approximately 20,000 a year are now going as immigrants, and many later
                        travel back to the Philippines for an extended stay. The cumulative impact
                        of these tens of thousands of <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0508"
                        />exposures to our country would have a continuing and pervasive influence
                        on the course of internal Philippine affairs, and on our bilateral
                        relations, even if there were no U.S. Government employees in the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>4. Considered in this broader context, the number of official Americans in
                        the Philippines is not in itself a critical factor in our relations. Our
                        intentions and attitudes in all the complex issues in our contractual
                        relationships, and our policy in the area as a whole, are still much more
                        important.</p>

                        memorandum of October 20, 1969 directed the Under Secretaries Committee to
                        make two studies:</p>
                    <p>(1) A comparison of the 1947 U.S.-Philippine Military Bases Agreement with
                        similar U.S. arrangements elsewhere, in which the objective would be to
                        bring U.S. privileges and immunities in the Philippines down to a level
                        comparable with rights we enjoy elsewhere. <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460"
                            facs="0509"/>Particular attention was to be given to the questions of
                        length of tenure and criminal jurisdiction procedures.</p>
                    <p>(2) A comparison of the extent of U.S. base holdings in the Philippines with
                        those we hold elsewhere, with a view to the releasing of Philippine
                        baselands surplus to our needs.</p>
                    <p>These studies were to be preliminary to an early invitation to the
                        Philippines to renegotiate the Military Bases Agreement.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss>, concentrating on the areas of tenure,

                        comparable with our arrangements elsewhere.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Tenure</p>
                    <p>The Philippine bases agreement runs to 1991; most of our other agreements are
                        on a one-year terminable basis, and run concurrently with mutual defense
                        treaties.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Criminal Jurisdiction</p>
                    <p>In this area, the provisions of the Philippine agreement are about comparable
                        with those we have elsewhere.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Unanimous Position</p>
                    <p>Both State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> agree that the principal
                        features of the existing arrangement should be retained and that anticipated

                    <p>However, this conclusion may well be unacceptable to the Philippines unless
                        changes in the manner the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> actually
                        operates could make our position more palatable and the <gloss

                        can be devised to make this decision more acceptable.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Base Rights and Operating Rights</p>
                    <p>Some of our agreements give slightly greater rights to host countries in such
                        matters as the posting of host officials on the bases than the Philippine
                        Agreement does.</p>

                    <p>State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> agree that the U.S. should
                        consider permitting the posting of appropriate Philippine officials on the

                        administrative functions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Divided Position</p>
                    <p>State recommends that the U.S. also consider establishment of some form of
                        nominal joint command of the bases. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> does

                    <p>Short of full joint-basing, there appear to be possibilities for offering the

                        selective joint-use in specific circumstances in which U.S. operational
                        control of the bases would not be compromised.</p>

                    <p>State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> agree on the utility of a study

                    <p>The Philippines may raise the issue of the 1952 mutual security treaty in the
                        course of the base negotiations. Presumably the Filipinos will seek, as they
                        have in the past, to obtain a more explicit commitment from the United
                        States to come to their defense than that contained in the treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Unanimous Position</p>
                    <p>State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> agree on the need to tell the
                        Philippine Government when they raise this question that any effort to
                        renegotiate the treaty would be completely counterproductive, especially,
                        given the mood of the U.S. Senate.</p>

                    <p>The Philippines may raise the issue of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>

                        organization and privileges. These are nagging irritants which the
                        Philippines have long wished to solve. In 1966 the Philippine Government
                        drafted (and the U.S. rejected) a new draft Mutual Defense Assistance
                        Agreement in which a drastic reduction in <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1"
                            >JUSMAG</gloss> prerogatives was proposed along with a countervailing
                        increase in Philippine authority and independence of action, particularly
                        with regard to freeing the Philippine Government from obtaining <gloss

                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> procurement. The Philippine draft agreement
                        also sought removal of the present injunction in paragraph 15 of the 1953
                        agreement that arms and other military supplies can only be obtained from
                        third country sources with explicit U.S. approval.</p>

                    <p>These may be important considerations for the Filipinos. It is possible that
                        U.S. concessions in this area may relieve Philippine pressures for
                        concessions in other areas, particularly in criminal jurisdiction where
                        there is little give in the U.S. position. Accordingly, the IG has assigned
                        itself the task of determining specific revisions in the Military Assistance
                        Agreement that might be responsive to Philippine needs.</p>

                        sugar quota in a successor agreement to Laurel–Langley. They may seek to tie
                        extension of U.S. base rights to obtaining equivalent Laurel– Langley

                    </p>
                    <p>By Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s memorandum of March
                        25, 1970, the President has directed a one-third reduction of U.S. military
                        and civilian personnel stationed at Clark Air Base. A one-quarter reduction
                        of U.S. personnel of all U.S. military and civilian agencies elsewhere in
                        the Philippines was also directed.</p>
                    <p>The likely impact on the military bases negotiations of personnel reductions
                        of this magnitude will be to increase Philippine demands for more financial
                        offset to counter the negative effects these cuts will have on their balance
                        of payments. Since U.S. base spending totals about $150 million annually, it
                        seems evident the reductions will entail a loss to the Philippines of the
                        order of $50 million annually.</p>

                    <p>These are <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>'s feelings, not
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>'. So far as we are aware,
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> does not know of the planned reductions,
                        though rumors are already said to be floating around Clark.</p>

                    <p>Informal consultation with the State Department and the Embassy in Manila
                        indicates that the following questions will arise in implementing your
                        instructions:</p>
                    <p>—The impact upon our strategic position in the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>—When and how to tell the Philippine Government about the reductions.</p>
                    <p>—The effect that the reductions will have on the political position of
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName>.</p>
                    <p>—The relationship between the reductions and upcoming negotiations on our
                        base rights in the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>—The impact of cuts on the Philippine economy, particularly its foreign
                        exchange position.</p>
                    <p>—The labor problems caused by laying off Philippine employees.</p>
                    <p>—The effect of the phasing of the reductions on all the above.</p>
                    <p>I have asked <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName>, as
                        Chairman of the Under Secretaries Committee, to draw up a reduction plan for
                        submission to you. He has been specifically authorized to include in his
                        report an evaluation of the implications of the planned reductions for
                        U.S./Philippine relations and for U.S. strategic capabilities in Asia. I
                        have suggested that the plan envisage a completion date in 1971 for the
                        planned reductions. Defense has asked for more time to make its submission
                        for this report and a separate memorandum is coming to you on this
                        subject.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I feel that you will wish a more personal appraisal of some of the
                        characteristics of President <persName>Marcos</persName> than it is wise for
                        me to put into my general report to you, which of course will be read by
                        several others. I wish I could do this part orally, but as this is
                        impossible at present, <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0515"/>I have asked
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to prevent distribution
                        and filing of this portion of my report.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> forwarded the letter to
                            the President under a June 8 covering memorandum which summarized
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>'s “revealing and
                            sensitive letter” “on President <persName>Marcos</persName> and his
                            place in Philippine politics and history.” A notation on the memorandum
                            indicates that the President saw it. Attached but not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As I see it, <persName>Marcos</persName> is a product of the political system
                        here, and not the cause of that system. His training in that system here has
                        been in fact nearly all of his adult life—through the Congress, the Senate
                        and now the Presidency. The whole atmosphere has been one of public
                        expectancy that anyone able to move through these ranks would capitalize
                        financially on their positions—and anyone who did not would be considered
                        naive indeed—if not down-right incapable. This is one of the things that I
                        predict will change—but we are only in the initial phases of this now.</p>
                    <p>Politics is still the single biggest industry in the Philippines. Candidates
                        for public office spend huge amounts of their personal wealth in campaigns.
                        If elected, they usually recoup these amounts while in office.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> is no exception to this.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, like other Filipino politicians, has always
                        been corrupt by American standards, but by Filipino standards he is no
                        better or no worse than other Filipino politicians. Some several persons
                        close to the President say that during his first term in office he amassed a
                        multimillion dollar fortune, although there is no absolute proof of this.
                        Yet when you compare his performance with that of past Filipino Presidents,
                        such as Garcia and Magapagal, <persName>Marcos</persName> has done more for
                        the Filipino people than many of the Presidents combined. He built more
                        roads, pushed through miracle rice, built school houses, etc. While the
                        opponents dismiss this with the phrase “the more projects, the more
                        kickbacks,” nevertheless there is material evidence to show that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> did carry through with his infrastructure
                        program better than anyone before him had done.</p>
                    <p>Not long after I got here a Chinese businessman of prominence said to me “You
                        Americans are far too critical of <persName>Marcos</persName> because he is
                        the best we ever had. Before <persName>Marcos</persName>, not even 20% of
                        appropriated funds were put to good usage. <persName>Marcos</persName> has
                        more than doubled that figure—and that's progress.” I guess it's all in the
                        point of view!</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> is a typical Filipino. While money normally is
                        power anywhere in the world, in the Philippines it would seem, many times,
                        that money is the only thing that counts. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        believes that to keep the feudal-like political barons from his throat he
                        must amass sufficient wealth to keep them in check. When you ask a Filipino
                        who may have $20,000,000 why he continues to amass greater amounts of money,
                        he will give you a simple but honest reply: “That's the way the game is <pb
                            n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0516"/>played in the Philippines.”
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> also believes that anything can be bought in
                        the Philippines and he may be right, at least for the time being—but as I
                        say in my main report I believe a beginning at least is being made in a
                        change in the system.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that <persName>Marcos</persName> will endeavor to recoup the
                        private monies that he spent in getting re-elected. Whether he will have the
                        good sense to at least stop there, I just don't know. He is not engaged in
                        petty or small things such as the corruption around our bases. He is a very
                        sophisticated operator and anything he does will be well concealed through
                        others in such things as private investment, stock market manipulations,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Whatever his shortcomings, the Philippines, barring accident, has him for
                        almost four more years, and so do we. Someday there will be a Jerry Roxas,
                        but Jerry for all of his fine qualities, lacks one all-important one—the
                        leadership capacity to get himself elected President of the Philippines.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> has been described as the greatest Filipino
                        politician since Quezon. Politicians do not achieve greatness by
                        insensitivity to changing demands, and I think it would be a mistake to
                        underestimate <persName>Marcos</persName>' capacity to adjust to a new
                        situation and work towards goals that are both in his own and his country's
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The personal relationship we have been able to develop with both the
                        President and Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> are highly satisfactory—and
                        have reached the point where I can say in all candor I do not want them to
                        be any closer than they are now. He is easy and pleasant to work with, is
                        extremely able and is quick in his actions and decisions. He is also,
                        underneath, obviously quite pro-American.</p>
                    <p>I hope very much, Mr. President, that we can get at least a part of what you
                        want here during your own tenure of office.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>In response to your request of last autumn, the Under Secretaries Committee
                        has come up with the outlines of a negotiating stance with regard to base
                        rights in the Philippines, and has approved some preliminary conclusions
                        concerning the base land issues.</p>
                    <p>In short, the Committee came to the following conclusions:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Base Lands</hi>. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                        holdings in the Philippines alone exceed all other <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                            >USAF</gloss> holdings in foreign countries. It was agreed to relinquish
                        36% of the holdings at Clark and to consider further relinquishments there.
                        The naval base at Sangley will be given up as soon as the need for its
                        Vietnam support effort ceases. Part of the Navy's 36,000 acres at Subic Bay
                        should be relinquished, following a watershed survey. Camp John Hay (Baguio)
                        will be retained unless the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> insists on
                        its return. These relinquishments will be offered during the course of
                        negotiations to gain Philippine acceptance of points vital to us on other
                        issues, and thus will not be offered at the beginning of the
                        negotiation.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Tenure</hi>. The Bases Agreement runs until 1991. Such
                        agreements with other countries usually have a one-year termination clause,
                        comparable to the mutual defense treaties. The Committee agreed that the
                        unstable political situation in the Philippines argues against offering such
                        a one-year clause. However, if the Philippines press us on the Agreement,
                        consideration will be given to reducing the length of its validity and/or
                        agreeing to a termination clause.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Criminal Jurisdiction</hi>. The Agreement itself is
                        similar to other agreements, but the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        seldom waives its jurisdiction, whereas other countries regularly do so.
                        Problems concerning fair trial, the conditions of imprisonment, etc.,
                        generate unique problems in the Philippines. It was agreed to study ways to
                        improve procedures and relations with the Philippines on this sensitive
                        issue, but to place a high priority on retaining our present rights in this
                        delicate area.</p>
                    <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0518"/>
                    <p>—“<hi rend="italic">Filipinization</hi>” of the Bases. Detailed proposals
                        will be developed to permit the Philippines a role in immigration, health
                        and customs procedures on the bases, to provide for selective joint use and
                        possibly to effect a symbolic joint command of the bases. In these respects,
                        our present Agreement is less liberal than with most other countries.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed some of the most persistent Philippine complaints relate not to
                        the Base Agreement itself, but to other aspects of our military
                        relationship. On the <hi rend="italic">1953 Mutual Defense Assistance
                            Agreement</hi>, the Filipinos have a point. We have controls not
                        duplicated elsewhere— for instance, the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        can purchase military equipment from third countries only with our approval.
                        A specific proposal for renegotiation of that agreement, to bring treatment
                        in line with our other allies, will be developed and cleared by the Under
                        Secretaries Committee. Negotiations on this agreement could be dovetailed
                        into the Bases Agreement negotiation at a later stage.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> periodically suggests that it wishes
                        to renegotiate the <hi rend="italic">1952 Mutual Defense Treaty</hi> to get
                        a more explicit commitment from us. The Committee agreed that we would
                        suggest to the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, if the issue arises,
                        that renegotiation would be impractical and might be counterproductive.</p>
                    <p>The Philippines have hinted that they would like to renegotiate our <hi
                            rend="italic">economic agreements</hi> concurrently with the military
                        ones. Their enthusiasm for this course of action may be diminishing,
                        however, as they begin to realize that they cannot demand economic
                        concessions for continued military agreements, as they have done in the
                        past. The Committee agreed to keep these negotiations separate if
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>The attached memorandum suggests that we will hold up negotiation of the
                        Military Bases Agreement while we analyze the impact of proposed personnel
                        reductions on our relationship.<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> This is inaccurate. There
                        will of course be a connection, but no proposal to defer the Base
                        negotiations was actually agreed among the Under Secretaries, and in fact
                        State is proceeding to develop specific negotiating instructions and to
                        authorize our Embassy in Manila to begin negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> will probably wish to defer formal
                        negotiation for Philippine domestic reasons. This is not a matter of great
                        concern, since our willingness to negotiate will be documented by our offer,
                        and this alone takes much of the sting out of the aspects of our military
                        relationship which are unfavorable to the Philippines.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> has sent you a
                        personal assessment of the situation in the Philippines and of the proper

                        <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> refers to the convulsion of
                            anti-<persName>Marcos</persName> feeling which swept Manila in January
                        and he observes that it is still impossible to say with confidence what
                        caused that movement and what it may portend for the direction of Philippine
                        development. He nevertheless ventures some estimates as to what happened
                        then, what courses are open to <persName>Marcos</persName> now, and what the
                        U.S. role should be now and in the future.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> sees these as arising from
                        the economic/financial crisis, from the psychological letdown following the
                        election, from the revulsion against <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                        manipulation of the elections, and from the long overdue outbreak of student
                        political activism. At least as important, factions of the local
                        Establishment turned against <persName>Marcos</persName> out of personal
                        animosity and from fear of his growing power reflected in his election
                        victory. Through their control of information media, these factions did an
                        incredible hatchet job on <persName>Marcos</persName>' reputation within a
                        matter of weeks.</p>
                    <p>(<persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> touches only lightly on
                        another cause which was prominent in the Embassy's reporting at the time: in
                        many normally conservative quarters including the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CFF1">Church</persName>, there has developed a deep and
                        widespread frustration and disillusionment against the Philippine political
                        system and its venality.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The choices before <persName>Marcos</persName>.</hi>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> could embark on one of three broad courses:</p>
                    <p>—Assume leadership of the forces calling for fundamental but non-violent
                        change, and challenge the Establishment.</p>
                    <p>—Continue the present lines of Philippine politics, playing off one group
                        against the other, using the carrot and the stick, and avoiding any
                        fundamental challenge to the system.</p>
                    <p>—Retreat to a defensive position relying upon the military and upon the more
                        conservative elements in society.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> does not seem to have decided which course he
                        will take, and he may attempt to temporize throughout his second term. With
                        the best will in the world, he might well find it impossible to pursue the
                        first course above. The Establishment is very powerful, and resistances to
                        change would be powerful. <persName>Marcos</persName> might be murdered if
                        he attempted to challenge the system, and in any case he would not carry
                        Congress.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The U.S. role.</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> continues to think that we
                        should take the course that you have sketched out: to modernize our
                        relationship and put it on a “most favored nation” basis. He notes that we
                        are moving ahead to begin negotiations on the major areas of our
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>He predicts, however, that we should not expect a dramatic improvement from
                        our efforts, and he observes that our problems are most acute in
                        renegotiating the Bases Agreement and Laurel–Langley Economic Agreements. He
                        notes the following problems:</p>
                    <p>—Filipinos really do not realize that they are getting most–favored-nation or
                        better treatment in many areas. As an example he points out that our
                        military criminal jurisdiction agreement is in fact as favorable as our
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or Japan formulas, but that most
                        other countries almost invariably grant us waivers of jurisdiction in
                        criminal cases, whereas the Philippines almost never do.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> himself was astonished when <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> cited the comparative statistics on
                        waiver requests to him.</p>
                    <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0521"/>
                    <p>—The Philippines will pose exaggerated demands which we will not be able to
                        meet.</p>
                    <p>—Negotiations will proceed in a “Chautauqua” atmosphere which makes it doubly
                        difficult to come to terms.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> recommends nevertheless that
                        we go ahead with due caution on the negotiations, and he recommends that we
                        push ahead with economic negotiations without waiting for generalized
                        preferences to LDCs under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. He believes
                        that we should be prepared to give the Filipinos something in the way of
                        continued preferences, while we protect the legitimate interests of American
                        business in the Philippines. He suggests that we consider simultaneously
                        negotiating a Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty. (We have already
                        urged State to develop a negotiating scenario for the economic
                        negotiations.)</p>
                    <p>For the longer term, <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> sees some
                        hope. He says that all the Philippines needs is “good government and birth
                        control.” He notes that there are powerful forces beginning to work toward
                        an improvement in political morality, and that the Establishment is jittery
                        and less inclined than heretofore to play “politics as usual.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> urges that we
                        provide quiet advice to move the Philippines towards correcting its own
                        problems, but he also recommends more use of international advice through
                        the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, the World Bank, etc. He urges also
                        that we bring the Japanese into the exercise. He sees this as the way to
                        move steadily away from our strictly bilateral “special relationships.”</p>
                    <p>I have sent an acknowledgement to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> on his other letter on President

                        <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> has done an outstanding job
                        in Manila. He has gotten across to the Philippine leadership that we are
                        moving toward a new relationship, that we plan to treat the Philippines as
                        an equal, but that we will no longer tolerate the Filipinos treating us as a
                        whipping boy yet at the same time expect us to be particularly understanding
                        and responsible toward them. (On at least two occasions, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> has stopped cold schemes by Romulo
                        to blame us publicly in disputes over military base and consular matters, by
                        making it clear that such behavior is simply not acceptable.) He has gotten
                        the same message across to our military and civilian personnel in the
                        Philippines, and has stopped certain high-handed practices which annoyed the
                        Filipinos. At the same time, he has established close personal relations
                        with Philippine leaders. (He was <persName>Marcos</persName>' personal guest
                        on a recent Presidential boat tour of the <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
                            facs="0522"/>outer islands.) I think that he would appreciate a message
                        from you, and that he deserves one.</p>

                    <p>6187. Subj: Secretary's Talks with <persName>Marcos</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. In the brief interval after arrival of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> here and his call on
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, we had opportunity with <persName
                            corresp="#p_PRF3">Pedersen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> present to run through the bilateral subjects that
                        might come up, with particular attention to the subject of a possible state
                        visit. The Secretary had had the opportunity of reading report of my last
                        conversation with <persName>Marcos</persName> on this subject transmitted to
                        Department as Manila 6085.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Telegram 6085 from
                            Manila, June 30, reported <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>'
                            discussion with <persName>Marcos</persName>, including the postponement
                            of the latter's August visit to Washington and the reduction of U.S.
                            forces in the Pacific. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0523"/>
                    <p>2. The Secretary decided that he and I would go alone to Malacanang and I got
                        this word to <persName>Marcos</persName> prior to our arrival. When we
                        arrived only Romulo was with <persName>Marcos</persName>. After the
                        photographers had left <persName>Marcos</persName> indicated that he would
                        appreciate a short time with the Secretary alone and the two of them went
                        into the inner library. They stayed alone for the full hour that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> allotted to us. (Other heads of delegations
                        were scheduled every 15 minutes thereafter.) In the meantime, Romulo and I
                        occupied ourselves with current business and enjoyed the company of Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> for a portion of that time.</p>
                    <p>3. What follows herein is my own summary of the debriefing the Secretary had
                        the time to give me, and which he had indicated conveys the substance on the
                        main substantive points. It lacks obviously finer points and nuances which
                        it may be possible for me to obtain from the Secretary later on as his
                        schedule permits.</p>
                    <p>4. The most important point to emerge was that the proposed state visit for
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> in August is indefinitely postponed.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> took the initiative on this subject, raising
                        some of his own doubts about the wisdom of his absence here in August, and
                        wondering frankly what practical results could come out of the visit at this
                        time, despite the fact that he would personally very much like another
                        opportunity for discussions with our President. The Secretary indicated
                        that, while he knew from President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> personally how much he would welcome such a visit,
                        that the timing did indeed raise some problems on our side. The Secretary
                        mentioned upcoming election period in the United States, the sensitivity of
                        matters affecting the Far East now in our relations with the Hill, etc. This
                        led <persName>Marcos</persName> to suggest that maybe it was not very good
                        timing for either of us. In the discussion that followed as to exactly how
                        to leave the matter, the Secretary suggested that really nothing need be
                        done in any public sort of way, as it had never become public knowledge that
                        such a trip had been tentatively planned. <persName>Marcos</persName> said
                        this was quite agreeable with him.</p>
                    <p>5. They both agreed that it would be extremely important that there be no
                        leaks that a visit had been planned but postponed. In the event of
                        unfortunate leaks it could, of course, be quite truthfully said that it was
                        certainly the desire of our President to see President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> on a state visit and the matter had been
                        discussed from time to time with no decision as to possible timing (I would
                        like to add my own recommendation that all concerned quietly cross off the
                        possibility of a <persName>Marcos</persName> visit on August 19 and ensure
                        that there be no leak or comment about it). It was the Secretary's own
                        impression that <persName>Marcos</persName> was not personally disappointed
                        at the thought of an indefinite postponement, and in fact may have been
                        somewhat relieved.</p>
                    <p>6. There was general discussion on the reduction of forces in the Pacific
                        area to somewhere near pre-Tonkin levels as the situation would <pb n="475"
                            xml:id="pg_475" facs="0524"/>permit. It appears to me that the Secretary
                        did a very good job on this and that <persName>Marcos</persName> accepted
                        the philosophy that this was really a part of a process that America should
                        go through in order to be certain that the administration could keep the
                        support of the Congress and the country for maintaining those forces abroad
                        that would be actually necessary for vital security interests. The Secretary
                        talked about reductions to be made elsewhere in the Pacific. I feel that
                        this subject went well. He did not, of course, get into actual figures for
                        the Philippines, which I will handle later on with
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> as they become known.</p>
                    <p>7. The Secretary expressed our appreciation to <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        for the many instances of late in which he personally had lent the support
                        of his office to making conditions around our bases better for our own
                        forces. The Secretary took note of the fact that, as I had told him earlier,
                        we were nearing the point of being ready to undertake base negotiations at
                        his convenience. <persName>Marcos</persName> made a rather interesting
                        comment that he thought our troops would be happier in the Philippines if
                        they used their leave opportunities to travel more in the Philippines away
                        from the base areas, where conditions were bound to be some-what abnormal.
                        He said the average Filipino liked Americans, and it was a pity that most of
                        the troops never saw anything of the Philippines except the bar-infested
                        areas outside the base gates. (The President may be thinking of the benefits
                        of tourism, but there is no doubt in my mind that he made a very good point
                        on this one.) <persName>Marcos</persName> gave the impression he was really
                        in no hurry on base negotiations, and would just as soon see them postponed
                        for a while.</p>
                    <p>8. There was some general discussion of Laurel–Langley problems with both
                        sides apparently agreeing that there seemed no need to attempt any early
                        negotiations on that matter as well. <persName>Marcos</persName> did mention
                        his concern again over the sugar quota and the Secretary said that there
                        would be every desire on the part of his department to be helpful to the
                        Philippines as this problem came up, but that as <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        knew other departments and the Congress itself were in the last analysis
                        probably most important in the decision making process.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> said he appreciated the statement of support
                        from the Secretary on the part of the Department.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName>Marcos</persName> indicated that he hoped the Philippines could
                        get more military assistance from the United States in the future so that
                        they could handle to the greatest possible extent their own security
                        problems. He said he thought that the army could handle the limited type of
                        internal security problems that now face the Philippines, but that their
                        capability at present was really very little greater than that, and their
                        navy and air force was practically non-existent. He said he fully shared,
                        what he understood to be President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>'s view, that nations should be more self-reliant on
                        such matters, but that the Philippine <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476"
                            facs="0525"/>financial situation would prevent them from moving forward
                        much further without assistance. The Secretary said that, within the
                        increasingly tight budgetary restrictions upon the administration,
                        Philippine requirements would of course continue to receive sympathetic
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>10. There was no specific discussion on any future amount or type of possible
                        U.S. assistance to the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>11. The Secretary tells me that the talks were extremely friendly and frank
                        throughout and it appeared to me that the talks went well.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> certainly seemed to be in a good mood as
                        they emerged and rejoined Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>, Romulo and
                        me.</p>
                    <p>12. The Secretary has asked me to add to this message his personal desire
                        that all elements of State involved in a possible
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> visit ensure that the matter die as of now
                        without leak or comment. He also asked that this particular matter be
                        explained to the White House staff so that they will realize the
                        desirability of no leak or no further mention of such a possible visit.</p>

                        fully accomplished by June, 1971.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications of the Plan for our Strategic Position
                        in the Pacific and our Relations with the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>The recommended reductions will reduce our capacity and flexibility to deal
                        with military contingencies in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific but
                        should not prove unmanageable as long as they are tied to Vietnam
                        withdrawals. They should not affect our continued tenure at bases in the
                        Philippines which will become increasingly important in the years to come
                        because of their unique geographical location, their capacity to handle
                        “surge requirements” and the likelihood that it will be more difficult to
                        maintain present base structures at a number of other pacific locations.</p>
                    <p>In the long-run, the impact of a substantial reduction in our involvement in
                        the Philippines, which will contribute to greater Philippine self-reliance,
                        should be favorable to U.S.–Philippines relations. In the short-run,
                        however, there will be the following problems:</p>
                    <p>—As a result of the reductions, 3,000–5,000 directly hired Philippine
                        employees of our bases will be laid off and up to 11,000 Philippine contract
                        employees will be put out of work. This could result in strikes and protests
                        organized by Philippine labor unions.</p>
                    <p>—The Philippines will loose $30–40 million a year in foreign exchange during
                        a time of balance of payments crisis.</p>
                    <p>—The people of the Philippines, the majority of whom regard the retention of
                        U.S. bases as beneficial, could interpret the reductions as a U.S.
                        withdrawal from the Philippines. This could intensify the climate of
                        uncertainty which now characterizes the Philippine political situation.</p>
                    <p>—The reductions could also be interpreted as a sign of our disapproval of
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> and a lack of confidence in his
                        leadership, making his political position more difficult.</p>
                    <p>We can, however, minimize these short-run problems by:</p>
                    <p>—making it clear that the reductions are related to Vietnam withdrawals and
                        to world-wide budgetary and manpower constraints.</p>

                    <p>—emphasizing our continued commitment to Philippine security in the context
                        of bi-lateral military agreements.</p>
                    <p>—undertaking new programs, where possible in the context of multilateral
                        approaches, to mitigate the economic effects.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Cuts in the Diplomatic Mission</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> recommends only a
                        minimum of reductions (roughly 3%) in U.S. personnel under his direct
                        control. Under his recommendation, one American position from the diplomatic
                        mission would be eliminated; 5 would be converted to staffing by Philippine
                        nationals and 17 involving regional activities would be relocated else–where
                        in the Pacific area. The Under Secretaries Committee has also described two
                        alternate plans for Embassy cuts, but has made no recommendation.</p>
                    <p>—The first involves a reduction of 50, which amounts to a 12 percent cut.
                        Although a few programs would have to be curtailed, Washington agencies
                        involved, including the Bureau of the Budget, feel that a reduction of this
                        magnitude would be manageable.</p>
                    <p>—The second envisages a 25% reduction in Embassy personnel. In the opinion of
                        the Under Secretaries Committee, it would require termination or severe
                        curtailment of a number of programs considered essential to achieving our
                        current national objectives in the Philippines.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you approve the first alternate plan proposed by the
                        committee which calls for a 12 percent cut in the diplomatic mission. In my
                        opinion, the 3 percent reduction recommended by Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> would not be consistent with the
                        deep cuts proposed in other programs.<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">The

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. The Timing of Reductions at Clark Field</p>
                    <p>The plan for reductions at Clark Field, which was drawn up by the Air Force,
                        calls for 75% of the reductions to be implemented by September, 1970 (100
                        percent implementation by that time would involve an undesirable increase in
                        the number of personnel who had to be redeployed elsewhere in the Western
                        Pacific).</p>
                    <p>On the basis of your instructions, the Defense Department has already
                        incorporated this immediate drawdown at Clark into its budget plan for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 and is now reluctant to stretch out
                        the reductions any further. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> feels, however, that problems with the Philippine
                        Government would be reduced if the immediate reductions <pb n="479"
                            xml:id="pg_479" facs="0528"/>at Clark were delayed a few months. The
                        Department of State requests that you instruct the <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                            >DOD</gloss> that at least 50% of the scheduled reductions for Clark Air
                        Base be completed by September 30, 1970 and that, to the extent possible,
                        the balance of that reduction be spread out more evenly over the period
                        ending June 30, 1971.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>I believe that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> is
                        in the best position to judge the effects of the timing of the cuts. I
                        recommend, therefore, that we leave some leeway for the Clark reductions to
                        be slowed down. This could be done by directing that at least 50 percent of
                        the Clark cuts be made by September 30 and that the level of any immediate
                        reductions beyond that level be worked out between the State and Defense
                        Departments and the Ambassador.<note n="5" xml:id="d225fn5">The President

                    <p>1. I called on President <persName>Marcos</persName> this morning to discuss
                        forthcoming U.S. personnel reductions in accordance with above messages. In
                        our continuing conversations in the past several weeks I have attempted to
                        gradually prepare him for this type of specific information so that it would
                        not come as a surprise. The Secretary also did a good job for us with
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> on this subject when he was here early this
                        month. In spite of this I think he got a bit of a jolt over the magnitude of
                        the cuts and the fact that they would start right away.</p>
                    <p>2. The first question from <persName>Marcos</persName> was whether these cuts
                        affected in any way our Mutual Defense Treaty. I said that they did not,
                        that our commitments still stood, and after some discussion on this point I
                        believe he accepted the fact that the air and naval defense of the
                        Philippines was not basically affected.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName>Marcos</persName> then quickly focused into the three points
                        which caused him the most concern. The first was the effect of the loss of
                        foreign exchange earnings from the bases on their precarious economic
                        situation and their current economic plans. The second was the loss of jobs
                        for Filipinos that would inevitably follow such a large cut of Americans. A
                        third point of concern was how the matter could be handled publicly in a
                        manner which does not cause considerable damage here. Our discussion focused
                        particularly on this latter point and prompted my preliminary warning cable
                        requesting that no public statement be made until we could think about this
                        matter further and I could discuss it with the military commanders.</p>
                    <p>4. With regard to the first two points above, <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        asked if I could give him statistics as to what we thought would actually be
                        involved in the way of loss of foreign exchange and loss of jobs. I told him
                        I was not in a position at the moment to do that but would give him as
                        quickly as I could our best estimate on these matters. He understands that
                        they will be very preliminary “estimates” but said they would be useful to
                        him in planning within his own government with the thought he should
                        initiate immediately.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName>Marcos</persName> asked what our plans were for handling the
                        matter publicly. I showed him a possible opening statement being considered
                        in Washington as contained in State 115652. When he read it his first
                        comment was “but this will serve to undo everything you and I have been
                        trying to do.” What he was referring to was handling doubts that are
                        widespread here about future U.S. intentions. He said he is continually
                        being asked if the U.S. intends to withdraw completely from the Philippines.
                        This had reached the point where he recently had been asked if the U.S. and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had not reached some kind of a private
                        understanding where the British would remain in the area, thus allowing U.S.
                        withdrawal. I said this was of course utter nonsense and he agreed, but
                        pointed out the fact that such questions do come from responsible
                        people.</p>
                    <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0530"/>
                    <p>6. <persName>Marcos</persName> asked what I could tell him alone and
                        privately about the future of U.S. intentions. Specifically, was this merely
                        the first of several cuts, and how far down did we plan to go? I told him
                        that I felt relatively sure that there was no planning within our Executive
                        Branch at this time for further cuts in the Philippines. I told him I was
                        sure that our President plans a continued military presence in the Pacific
                        area for the foreseeable future. I said that I could not of course be
                        categorical with him on actual figures for the future, but left him with no
                        doubt that we were not considering anything like a withdrawal from the
                        Philippines.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName>Marcos</persName> asked at one point if we need make any
                        statement at all. He said he was afraid that the draft I had shown him would
                        really raise fundamental questions that could not be answered. He then went
                        into a rather lengthy thinking out loud process as to whether we should not
                        try to answer some of these fundamental questions positively and publicly.
                        Could we for instance say that this was the only reduction planned for the
                        Philippines under the MDT; that there was no question of U.S. withdrawal
                        from the bases, etc., etc. I told him I did not think it was in the cards
                        that we could publicly commit ourselves to maintain the new reduced force
                        levels for forever-and-a-day. I did undertake to think further as to whether
                        we might in some manner handle publicly the question of whether our
                        commitments under the MDT were effected and also how the matter of doubts
                        about “withdrawals” might be handled.</p>
                    <p>8. I never felt more the real need of long ranged strategic planning for the
                        Pacific Area which I plugged for so hard at the Tokyo Conference than I did
                        during this conversation. I was somewhat taken aback to have him express
                        thoughts which resembled very closely some of my own argumentations on this
                        subject as contained in past cables.</p>
                    <p>9. I am convinced that we are dealing with a subject here on which we should
                        attempt to find the best possible answer for our own interests, as well as
                        those of <persName>Marcos</persName>, and in some instances at least I
                        believe we have common cause for concern. It is definitely not in our own
                        interest to have our image here as one of possible “withdrawal.” Our problem
                        certainly is not with <persName>Marcos</persName>, whom I can talk to
                        directly and who has the benefit of occasional talks such as the recent one
                        with the Secretary. Our problem is one of public understanding, and this
                        includes not only the masses but up through the Government and legislative
                        branches as well.</p>

                        statement which I think goes as far as we can towards meeting
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' needs, as well as our own. I will be seeing
                        him again on July 23 at 10:00 a.m., and same night at dinner, and if draft
                        is acceptable, I could show it to him then.</p>

                    <p>The Director met with Madam <persName>Marcos</persName> for thirty-five
                        minutes in the evening on 22 September 1970 at her suite in the Hotel
                        Madison. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJF1">James Rafferty</persName>, Special
                        Assistant to the United States Ambassador in the Philippines, The Honorable
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Henry A. Byroade</persName>, made the
                        introductions and then withdrew.</p>
                    <p>Madam <persName>Marcos</persName> began her presentation by drawing attention
                        to the forthcoming 10 November 1970 elections for delegates to a
                        constitutional convention in the Philippines, planned for June–July 1971.
                        She said socialist movements sponsored by certain lay and clerical elements
                        in the Catholic <persName corresp="#p_CFF1">Church</persName>, particularly
                        the Jesuits, and some Communist fronts are planning to contest
                        administration candidates in the election. She believes that the
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> Administration could lose the election by
                        default unless a crash program is organized to help it win. She noted that
                        the <persName corresp="#p_CFF1">Church</persName> has already picked
                        candidates, either priests or lay persons, for each election district.
                        Should these groups succeed in achieving their objectives, it would change
                        the form of government in the Philippines to Socialism or Communism, with
                        only a few people realizing what the real consequences would be. She
                        underscored her view that Philippine democracy is viable but will not
                        survive unless the United States helps the <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        Administration through this difficult period.</p>
                    <p>She said the Philippines is a child of the U.S. and illustrated this point by
                        describing Vietnam as a French baby, Malaysia as an English baby, and
                        Thailand as everybody's baby. She observed that in Asia one's creditability
                        is not measured by how one treats a friend, but how one <pb n="483"
                            xml:id="pg_483" facs="0532"/>treats his children. She is of the opinion
                        that the United States needs a victory in Asia to maintain its stature
                        there. A victory in Vietnam would be negative, she said, because a U.S.
                        victory in Vietnam is expected, but a victory for those who have and
                        continue to advocate democracy in the Philippines would be a positive one.
                        She pointed out the richness of Philippines national resources, the high
                        literacy rate (85%), and the cosmopolitan make-up of the population,
                        reiterating that something must be done between now and November 1971 to
                        help President <persName>Marcos</persName>.</p>
                    <p>She revealed that her husband is personally directing the current campaign
                        against pro-Communist guerrilla bands in Central Luzon, commonly referred to
                        as <gloss target="#t_HUKS1">HUKS</gloss>, and reminded her listeners of his
                        recent successes. Madam <persName>Marcos</persName> also noted the
                        President's efforts to meet his foreign financial obligation in order to
                        maintain a creditable international image, but observed that when high
                        interest and principal payments are made, little is left for internal
                        improvement. She called attention to the political and financial pressures
                        on President <persName>Marcos</persName> and described him as being squeezed
                        and pushed into a corner by his detractors. She described candidates of the
                        socialist fronts led by the Christian Socialist Movement (<gloss
                            target="#t_CSM1">CSM</gloss>) headed by ex-Senator Manglapus and the
                        Communists as articulate and clever. She believes these
                            anti-<persName>Marcos</persName> forces might succeed in their plan to
                        control the constitutional convention. In this event, she said, the
                        President would become a “strong man” because he has no intention of being
                        pushed out by the <gloss target="#t_CSM1">CSM</gloss> or the Communists. She
                        has been told that the <gloss target="#t_CSM1">CSM</gloss> is being
                        supported by the Adenauer Foundation in West Germany and has sources of
                        succor in England. She also directed attention to Father Ortega who recently
                        resigned as head of Ateneo University in Manila to stand as a candidate for
                        the constitutional convention under the <gloss target="#t_CSM1">CSM</gloss>
                        banner. Father Ortega is now in New York soliciting support for the <gloss
                            target="#t_CSM1">CSM</gloss>. She disclosed that her visit with
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPM1">Pope Paul</persName> VI, while en route to
                        Washington, was not for the purpose of piety but to persuade him to make his
                        visit to the Philippines in the third week of November, which would be after
                        the election, to prevent the Catholic <persName corresp="#p_CFF1"
                            >Church</persName> in the Philippines from using his visit to further
                        its political ambitions. She said the Pope suggested prayer as a possible
                        answer but he also agreed to delay his visit.</p>
                    <p>After listening to Madam <persName>Marcos</persName> suggest that the U.S.
                        sometimes helps enemies but forgets friends, i.e., help Germany and Japan
                        but forget the Philippines, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                        asked what was meant by a crash program. She replied:</p>
                    <p>a. A rural electrification program for the Philippines costing between 300
                        and 500 million dollars over a ten to twenty year period, announced by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as soon as possible
                        in order to achieve high political impact. She said it would be understood
                        that the full <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0533"/>amount would be
                        stretched out over a long period of time but she also emphasized that the
                        announcement would have to include the full amount in order to assure
                        maximum political gain.</p>
                    <p>b. A side sum of money for support of some of <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                        candidates at the barrio level.</p>
                    <p>c. Support for a better exchange rate between the peso and the dollar.</p>
                    <p>d. Birth control and family planning programs.</p>
                    <p>Madam <persName>Marcos</persName> said Dr. <persName>Hannah</persName> of
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, who is now in the Philippines,
                        promised 30 million dollars in aid, presumably for the rural electrification
                        program. She thinks the Asian Development Bank might provide 30 to 50
                        million dollars and the World Bank another 50 million dollars; some of this
                        latter money would be for birth control and family planning. In response to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>' request for other
                        possibilities, she suggested short-term bank loans and other short-term
                        international credit be extended to long-term loans to ease the pressure of
                        large interest payments. Presumably the money saved would be used for
                        political purposes. She also suggested some consideration be given to
                        manipulating the sugar industry, noting that the sugar barons are giving
                        money to Communists to win their support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"
                            >Helms</persName> said that he would see President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in the morning on 23 September and
                        would at that time discuss Madam <persName>Marcos</persName>' helpful and
                        eloquent conversation.</p>
                    <p>Madam <persName>Marcos</persName> then said funding the election at the
                        barrio level would mean 4,000 pesos for 35,000 barrios and also asked for
                        more arms and helicopters to enable President <persName>Marcos</persName> to
                        capture a fourth HUK leader, Commander Dante. She praised the Rockefeller
                        and Ford foundations who, she said, maintained the U.S. image in the
                        Philippines by developing the <gloss target="#t_IR81">IR–8</gloss> miracle
                        rice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> again said he would discuss
                        the matter with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">No record of this meeting was found.</note> Madam
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> noted that she might leave Washington on
                        Thursday but was prepared to stay for as long a time as it was necessary to
                        acquire support for her husband. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"
                            >Helms</persName> suggested that it would be proper for the response to
                        her request to come from the White House. Madam <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        ended the conversation by yet another appeal to “back her and support
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> and democracy in the Philippines.”</p>
                    <p>In the morning of 23 September, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJF1"
                            >Rafferty</persName> called the Agency and said that Madam
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> talked with President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"
                            >Helms</persName> departed. President <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        reportedly said to her that what is <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0534"
                        />needed is a 300 million dollar stabilizing fund for the peso.<note n="3"

                            that such a loan would be contrary to U.S. policy of moving from the

                            that it “would torpedo the whole <gloss target="#t_IMF1"

                        the 300 million dollars need never leave the United States but would be used
                        to backstop the peso free exchange rate, which, said <persName
                            corresp="#p_RJF1">Rafferty</persName>, is in a precarious position.

                        the U.S. national interest. It was decided that it would be undesirable to
                        have radical or left-wing elements take over the Constitutional Convention
                        and draft a constitution which, as Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        suggested to you, might turn the Philippines into a social democratic
                        welfare state or a Marxist state.</p>
                    <p>It was also recognized, though, that we do not now possess enough information
                        to make judgments on how to proceed in this matter, and <pb n="486"
                            xml:id="pg_486" facs="0535"/>that a number of questions would need to be
                        answered on the basis of information furnished by informed sources in
                        Washington and in Manila. These questions are:</p>
                    <p>—What do we want to achieve?</p>
                    <p>—What elements should we back? (In this respect, it was agreed that backing
                        supporters of President <persName>Marcos</persName> in the November 10
                        elections for delegates to the Convention would be preferable to seeing a
                        leftist victory. Alternatively, however, we might wish to back a moderate
                        group if one is identifiable because of the public criticism directed at
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> over his rigging of the election which gave
                        him his second term.)</p>
                    <p>—How do we provide our assistance?</p>
                    <p>—What should be the magnitude of our assistance?</p>
                    <p>At your direction State was tasked with preparing a study of the implications
                        of the Constitutional Convention and the elections of delegates.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d228fn3">The Department of State study, October 2, stated that
                            “Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> is the only person who professes to
                            believe that the Philippine Constitutional Convention will be controlled
                            by leftist elements. In fact, there are few observers who believe it
                            will not be controlled by President and Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>.” (Ibid.) The study was prepared in response
                            to a September 22 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_DJW1"
                                >Davis</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName>.
                            This attached covering memorandum stated that “the President has asked
                            that State prepare an analysis of the Philippine Constitutional
                            Convention and its possible outcomes, particularly the possibility that
                            it will be controlled by leftist elements. This analysis should include
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>'s appreciation
                            of the situation.” (Ibid.) Assistant Secretary <persName

                            he had heard that Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> had told the
                            President that “we in Washington didn't seem to know about the
                            Constitutional Convention” and “that I had not known anything about it
                            when she talked to me last Sunday” and seeking to correct this matter
                            “for the record.” (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied to <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                                >Green</persName> on October 13, stating in a postscript that he had
                            mentioned <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s letter to the
                            President who “has no illusions about the lady and a great deal of
                            confidence in you.” (Ibid.)</note> These specific questions, however,
                        were not addressed. The 40 Committee will meet again on October 6 to review
                        the answers and to submit the findings to you for a decision.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of assistance to the Philippines in rural electrification, it
                        was determined that some help might be provided prior to the November 10
                        elections. A statement on U.S. assistance might be made or financing of some
                        type provided through the World Bank. Under Secretary

                    <p>9074. 1. Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_RJF1"
                            >Rafferty</persName> at 6:30 a.m. this morning asking that an
                        appointment be arranged with me sometime today. I saw her for about an hour
                        and a half beginning at 2:00 p.m.</p>
                    <p>2. After small talk about her trip, I received, in general, the same
                        presentation she had made so often in Washington as reported in State
                            159948,<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">Telegram 159948 to Manila, September
                            29, summarized Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>' meetings in Washington.
                            (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 PHIL)</note> and I will
                        not therefore repeat it here. It was I think a somewhat altered presentation
                        in that at times she was extremely frank about some of the aspects of the
                        convention that worried her, particularly on personalities involved,
                        including those in their own camp.</p>
                    <p>3. I attempted to use the occasion to accomplish three specific things. One
                        was that I thought she had gone a little too far in exciting Washington that
                        the Philippines was on the doorstep of becoming another Chile. She took this
                        well, but in the discussion I began to realize that she was personally more
                        convinced that the dangers were real than I had thought would be the case.
                        She is obviously extremely tense, has lost considerable weight, and is in a
                        generally emotional state. She carried on at great length about the
                        weaknesses of the Nacionalista candidates in the upcoming election. At one
                        time she referred to some of them as “unattractive tribal leaders” who would
                        be incapable of matching the eloquence of the opposition in the convention
                        itself, and that many of them that she would consider reliable would be very
                        bad vote getters indeed, and put on quite sorry campaigns. I believe that
                        this is a belated recognition that she and <persName>Marcos</persName> did
                        not work hard enough to convince the right people to run, and on this point,
                        at least, I think she was being quite open and honest.</p>
                    <p>4. Another thing I sought to do was to try to make her understand why huge
                        amounts of cash from America at this time were not only impossible due to
                        severe budgetary limitations, but out of step with policy in Washington as
                        well. I told her that Washington was taking very seriously the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, and that “multilateralism”
                        was a strongly held view in Washington from the President on down. As a
                        practical matter, I said that even had we been able to pull the development
                        funds out of the safe that she had asked for, most would feel <pb n="488"
                            xml:id="pg_488" facs="0537"/>that this would have been an unkind act for
                        the Philippines itself. It would have dislodged and ruined the whole <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> exercise, the formation of the consultative
                        group, and even upset their current workable relations with U.S. private
                        banks. I told her of the very encouraging meeting in Paris (of which she was
                        uninformed) and said that Washington was sure that this route was better,
                        not only under our own conditions at home, but in the long-term interest of
                        the Philippines itself. She was encouraged by the news from Paris but
                        stressed over and over again that in the next few weeks, in particular, they
                        needed signs of direct American support. I told her we would do what we
                        could do (Can we for instance speed up action on <gloss target="#t_PL4801"
                            >PL–480</gloss> program?). </p>
                    <p>5. A third thing I had in mind was to try to prevent her from making any more
                        statements to the press that would imply huge American assistance. She gave
                        me a skillful reply on what was needed at the moment in the Philippines. She
                        does understand her people very well, but unfortunately has a rather dismal
                        ignorance on how things work for us at home. I told her I was already
                        extremely worried about her exclusive interview of Sept 29 with <gloss
                            target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss>, in which she had come very close indeed to
                        directly quoting our President, with approval and support, and had in the
                        same interview ticked off a number of items which totalled approximately
                        $900 million. She read the account and gave her explanation that it was
                        somewhat distorted and she had not meant this to be the case. I cautioned
                        her against further encounters with the press in which she could be
                        represented as saying such commitments had been made. I said that it was not
                        improbable that our President might be publicly asked by hostile members of
                        our Congress if these commitments had in act been made. This could, of
                        course, lead to a highly embarrassing situation. There is no doubt that she
                        got the point and realizes that there is indeed a direct conflict between
                        the postures she feels are important for her to assume here at the moment
                        and our own method of doing business. I hope this will tone down her future
                        statements.</p>
                    <p>6. When I returned to the office we had received the press release of the
                        consultative group in Paris and its accompanying reftel. This has received
                        no publicity in Manila, I suppose because of no Philippine news presence in
                        Paris, and inadequate diplomatic reporting. I am taking this to the
                        President within the hour in the hopes that he will see desirability of
                        playing this in a constructive light here. More will follow.</p>
                    <p>Postscript: I have just returned from seeing <persName>Marcos</persName>. He
                        was most appreciative of CG press release and was taking action as I left to
                        give it full play in the Philippines. As time was running out on him, if it
                        was to get heavy coverage in the influential Sunday press, I did not take up
                        other items.</p>

                        by his wife's freewheeling; none of this had come directly from him and she
                        might be launching personal political ambitions.</p>

                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said the basic question
                        was: Do we want at this time to earmark funds for covert support of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> candidates at a time when President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>—no neophyte at feeding at our trough—had not

                    <p>e. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NWE1">Nelson</persName> pointed out that there
                        were 2400 candidates for about 130 seats and that current information was
                        that the party in power had more than a 50% leverage, the opposition no more

                        Manila Reply to Questions Concerning Philippine Constitutional
                        Convention</p>
                    <p>1. It might be useful for a better understanding of the atmosphere in which
                        the Constitutional Convention will take place to note current issues in
                        Philippine political life which affect U.S. interests. These issues, which
                        have been developing over a number of years, are:</p>
                    <p>a. A desire to eliminate special privileges currently allowed to U.S.
                        investors and to regulate U.S. investments in the Philippines by new
                        legislation based upon laws similar to those governing foreign investments
                        in other Southeast Asian countries. In 1946 the Philippine Constitution was
                        amended to give U.S. citizens equal rights with Filipinos in the development
                        of natural resources and in the operation of public <pb n="491"
                            xml:id="pg_491" facs="0540"/>utilities. The Laurel–Langley Agreement
                        also granted reciprocal national treatment to U.S. or Philippine citizens
                        engaged in commercial activities within the other country. In addition, it
                        provided for tariff preferences which favor the U.S. This agreement has been
                        modified but its basic provisions remain intact.</p>
                    <p>b. A policy for U.S. military bases which would limit the free hand which we
                        have thus far enjoyed in their operation and which would, at the same time,
                        raise the price we must pay. The Philippine Constitution, for example,
                        authorizes the U.S. to acquire bases in the Philippines for the mutual
                        protection of the Philippines and the U.S., rent free.</p>
                    <p>c. A foreign policy which would establish diplomatic and trade relations with
                        the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations.</p>
                    <p>2. What interest does the U.S. have in the Philippine Constitutional
                        Convention?</p>
                    <p>In the long run we believe U.S. interests would be served adequately by a
                        constitution which would encourage the viability of a self-sustaining,
                        friendly Philippines, wherein our investments would not be discriminated
                        against and whose soil we could use for military purposes under certain
                        conditions. In the short term, 3–5 years, we would not want the use of the
                        two military bases, Clark and Subic, significantly curtailed. In addition,
                        we would not want to be confronted with constitutional provisions that would
                        adversely affect U.S. investments in the Philippines without adequate
                        provisions for retaining, or receiving compensation for, assets acquired
                        under the current arrangement.</p>
                    <p>3. Whom should we back, President <persName>Marcos</persName>, the moderates,
                        or no one?</p>
                    <p>At this point in time there is no need to commit U.S. support to any
                        particular group. <persName>Marcos</persName>-backed delegates probably will
                        constitute the single largest voting bloc in the Convention. The other
                        delegates will be made up of smaller groups representing business,
                        religious, provincial and other special interests. These smaller groups will
                        form alliances with one another and trade off support depending upon the
                        particular interests they wish to advance at a given moment. Information
                        available to us now on approximately 1,800 out of the more than 2,500
                        candidates leads to the conclusion that the majority are moderate in their
                        outlook on issues which affect the U.S. Of the 1,800 candidates examined,
                        there are less than 20 who can be classified as radical left or
                        communist.</p>
                    <p>4. If we are to become involved, how should we do it and what should be the
                        size of our activity?</p>
                    <p>We should remain alert to the workings of the Convention. Should trends
                        develop which would adversely affect our interests we should <pb n="492"
                            xml:id="pg_492" facs="0541"/>act [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] to back the work of individual
                        delegates or group leaders and deflate the more extreme proposals. We cannot
                        control the majority of the Convention delegates. We can, however, directly
                        or indirectly control small blocs of delegates which could, in turn, be
                        joined to larger forces to protect our interests if the need arises. We
                        believe the total number of delegates required to influence the Convention
                        would not exceed twenty.</p>

                                corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that “I agree in general with
                            these assessments, and see no reason to initiate any [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] action

                            Convention at this time.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a remote possibility that a solid minority of the delegates might
                        acquire a supra-nationalist attitude or spirit and press for a
                        constitutional revision which would jeopardize our interests. They might
                        call for an immediate nationalization of foreign investments with only
                        nominal compensation or they might seek to deny us the unrestricted use of
                        our military bases. In such an event, we believe we could [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] fragment the
                        minority bloc, and encourage delegates to join the
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> bloc. This would be costly [<hi
                            rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>],
                        and might promote charges of political interference, but probably could be
                        effective. In the long run such American interference in Philippine
                        elections, however, would be politically counterproductive.</p>

                        advantage. The Liberal Party has not recovered from its defeat in the 1969
                        Presidential elections and lacks adequate funds. The Catholic <persName
                            corresp="#p_CFF1">Church</persName> lacks the experience, the funds and
                        the organization necessary to contest political elections successfully on a
                        nationwide basis. With the possible exception of Manila, and Rizal Province,
                        the field is open to the pressures and tactics that the
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> machine has demonstrated it is capable of
                        applying. If he does <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0542"/>not have a
                        clear majority of the delegates in hand after the election of delegates, he
                        will, as a result of his machine's effort between now and the opening of the
                        Convention, acquire what he needs for a majority when the Convention begins.
                        He controls the Government machinery and will be the President for three
                        more years. The problems that <persName>Marcos</persName> might have during
                        the election and Convention will stem to a certain extent from his tendency
                        to over-kill and the resentment that such an approach generates.</p>
                    <p>7. Possible outcome of the Convention</p>
                    <p>The Convention most likely will produce a moderate document containing modest
                        changes in the structure and functioning of the Government. The proposed
                        Constitution probably will affect directly or indirectly foreign investments
                        in the Philippines, although it is doubtful that these new provisions would
                        be so extreme in nature as to exclude or seriously damage our business
                        interests. This will probably also apply to the U.S. military bases.</p>
                    <p>8. The unknown factors which complicate our analysis are the precise
                        objectives and plans of President <persName>Marcos</persName>. We know he
                        wishes to prevent any significant reduction of the powers of the Philippine
                        President. He also does not wish to decentralize a highly centralized
                        government. Some say he would like to perpetuate himself in the Presidency.
                        It is on these issues that delegates not in the <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        camp might unite into an anti-<persName>Marcos</persName> bloc. Should
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> seek to change the term of the President
                        from two four-year terms to one six-year term and have this new provision
                        apply to his administration, he probably will provoke the delegates to take
                        extreme positions, although they would not be against a six-year term per
                        se. If <persName>Marcos</persName> does decide that his tenure as President
                        is to be his primary objective, he would be willing to make all compromises
                        necessary to achieve this end. This could include a decision by him to adopt
                        a supranationalist position, and, in the unlikely event
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> finds himself unable to control the
                        Convention, it is possible that he would move to dissolve it.</p>

                        anything is likely to happen during the forthcoming elections which confirm
                        Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>' foreboding. In addition, in a recent
                        conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>,
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> himself stated that he does not share
                        Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>' concerns.</p>
                    <p>The consensus is that President <persName>Marcos</persName> will want to and
                        can quite adequately dominate the Convention through
                            pro-<persName>Marcos</persName> delegates and is already moving to
                        assure the election of delegates who will support him. He will probably be
                        successful in this endeavor without any U.S. help.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>-backed delegates are likely to constitute
                        the single largest voting bloc in the Convention.</p>
                    <p>As of now there are some 2600 candidates for 320 delegates positions to the
                        Convention. Information presently available on approximately 1800 of these
                        candidates leads to the conclusion that the majority are moderate in their
                        outlook on issues which affect U.S. interests. Of the 1800 candidates
                        studied, there are less than 20 who can be classified as radical left or
                        communist. Intelligence available at this juncture indicates that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, without any further effort, can be expected
                        to emerge from the November elections with a minimum of 100 Convention
                        delegates responsive to his dictates.</p>
                    <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0544"/>
                    <p>The principal knowledgeable concerns expressed over problems that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> might face during the election and ensuing
                        Convention generally stem from his tendency to over-kill and the resentment
                        that such an approach generates.</p>
                    <p>Based on the above, the 40 Committee concluded that involvement in the
                        forthcoming elections of delegates to the Philippine Constitutional
                        Convention is inadvisable. The Committee also agreed that following the
                        election there should be a careful assessment of those through whom we might
                        work effectively in furtherance of U.S. interests during the Convention
                        should circumstances then so dictate.</p>
                    <p>I will follow up on this and see that appropriate proposals for any action at
                        the Convention are submitted to the 40 Committee for consideration.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> began by explaining
                        to the President<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> was in Washington for
                            consultations.</note> that there was very little he could tell the
                        President which was good, in fact, he anticipated the President would be
                        more concerned than ever before with what Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> had to tell him. (The President
                        observed that the Philippines was indeed a “disaster area.”) However, just
                        to show that things weren't entirely bad, he wanted to tell the President of
                        progress which had taken place in three areas: foodstuffs, population
                        control, and increased influence on the part of technically-trained
                        personnel. On food products, the Philippines now produced <pb n="496"
                            xml:id="pg_496" facs="0545"/>all the rice needed to support the
                        population and then some. As to population control, a very effective program
                        had been implemented by President <persName>Marcos</persName> which enjoyed
                        the support of large segments of society including the Catholic <persName
                            corresp="#p_CFF1">Church</persName>, which had resulted in the
                        establishment of birth control clinics throughout the Philippines and a
                        downward trend in population increase. It was estimated that by 1980 the
                        rate of increase would drop from the present 3.3 percent per annum to 1.1
                        percent. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> described
                        this as a revolution which was even more important than the “green
                        revolution,” and noted that the Philippines would probably lead the rest of
                        Asia in the field of population control.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the influence of the “technocrats,” Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> said that as a result of prodding
                        by the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> had been induced to put fiscal controls into
                        effect and to put trained personnel in charge of these reforms. In fact,
                        about all the trained people the Philippines possessed were now in positions
                        of responsibility, and these young men were becoming increasingly
                        influential in determining Philippine policies. They were capable of
                        understanding, for example, that discrimination against American business
                        interests might cost the Philippines a disinvestment of close to $600
                        million, which would be a disaster for the Philippine economy. Thanks to the
                        technocrats, <persName>Marcos</persName> was now considering measures to
                        ease the pressures on American business interests. The President said that
                        he was glad to have this information.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the political situation in the Philippines, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> stated that he was obliged to
                        report that nothing good would come out of the Philippines in the next six
                        months. Just before leaving for Washington, he had had a long conversation
                        with <persName>Marcos</persName>, in which <persName>Marcos</persName> had
                        warned him of the possibility of serious disturbances in the next six-month
                        period. Political forces hostile to <persName>Marcos</persName> were
                        stirring up tensions and were actually preparing for an attempt to take over
                        the key installations in the city of Manila in an effort to discredit
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> and unseat him. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        had information to the effect that explosives and guns were being brought
                        into the city, so that points such as the power station and the telephone
                        exchange could be taken over or destroyed. <persName>Marcos</persName> had
                        received one intelligence report that $8 million worth of guns had been
                        purchased by opposition elements in Hong Kong—perhaps this was $8 million
                        Hong Kong rather than $8 million U.S. since the figure seemed high.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> explained that the
                            anti-<persName>Marcos</persName> forces were led by a man named Argenio
                        Lopez, one of the richest men in the Philippines and the worst enemy of the
                        United States there. The President interjected to wonder if Lopez was any
                        relation to the Philippine Vice President, and was told by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> that Lopez was the
                        brother of the Philippine Vice President. Vice President Lopez was <pb
                            n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0546"/>a fairly good man although rather
                        stupid, but Argenio was a sour, vicious, and bitter person who wanted to
                        drive the U.S. out of the Philippines completely. The danger was that if he
                        succeeded in unseating <persName>Marcos</persName>, he would be able to
                        control the Philippines via his brother. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> remarked at this point that there
                        was a 60 percent chance <persName>Marcos</persName> would not survive his
                        last three years in office. He explained to the President that by this he
                        meant <persName>Marcos</persName> might be assassinated.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> said
                        that the current crisis in the Philippines was undoubtedly of Lopez's
                        making. The jeepney (taxi cab) drivers had gone on strike, and this strike
                        had now gone on for nine days; unless somebody like Lopez had been
                        supporting the drivers it would have collapsed within four days because the
                        drivers couldn't normally stay out of work any longer. In addition, there
                        was unprecedented campaign of vilification against
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> also against the U.S., in the newspapers
                        owned by the Lopez interests, which comprised the majority of the Philippine
                        press. All of this added up to a very nasty situation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> then declared that
                        he had a very sensitive matter to lay before the President at
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' request. At the end of his predeparture
                        conversation with <persName>Marcos</persName>, <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        had warned him that he might find it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas
                        corpus and establish martial law in the city of Manila—unprecedented steps
                        which had not been taken by any Philippine President since the late 40's
                        during the hukbalahap movement. What <persName>Marcos</persName> wanted to
                        know was: in the event that he found it necessary to declare martial law in
                        Manila, would the United States back him up, or would it work against him?
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> noted that he had
                        promised <persName>Marcos</persName> he would bring back the President's
                        personal reply.</p>
                    <p>The President declared that we would “absolutely” back
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> up, and “to the hilt” so long as what he was
                        doing was to preserve the system against those who would destroy it in the
                        name of liberty. The President indicated that he had telephoned <persName
                            corresp="#p_TPE2">Trudeau</persName> of Canada to express this same
                        position. We would not support anyone who was trying to set himself up as a
                        military dictator, but we would do everything we could to back a man who was
                        trying to make the system work and to preserve order. Of course, we
                        understood that <persName>Marcos</persName> would not be entirely motivated
                        by national interests, but this was something which we had come to expect
                        from Asian leaders. The important thing was to keep the Philippines from
                        going down the tube, since we had a major interest in the success or the
                        failure of the Philippine system. Whatever happens, the Philippines was our
                        baby. He, the President, was an activist and felt very strongly that it was
                        far better to do something to try to save the situation than just to let it
                        slip away from us. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>
                        said that he was very happy to hear the <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498"
                            facs="0547"/>President say this. He acknowledged that if
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> did act he would undoubtedly pick up some of
                        his political enemies among those he arrested, but in general he would be
                        attempting to do the right thing.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> went on to remark
                        that in the event the worst happened, and <persName>Marcos</persName> was in
                        some way displaced by the Lopez faction, the U.S. would need to face up to
                        two options: whether to stay out of Philippine affairs entirely, or to
                        intervene in some way. (The President again remarked that he believed in
                        taking action rather than standing idly by.) If we did intervene, the
                        question would be how? One situation which he foresaw was that in which Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would come to us and ask us to back her up
                        in calling for a special Philippine Presidential election in which she
                        herself would run as a candidate. This would not be desirable. The President
                        expressed surprise that Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> would have
                        presidential aspirations of her own, and was interested in hearing that Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> very definitely had such aspirations. The
                        other possibility which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> envisaged would be for us to keep hands off until
                        the situation got so bad that the Philippine military decided to take action
                        and would request our support. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> believed that in this event we should respond
                        favorably. The Philippine military leaders were reliable—he pointed out they
                        were all West Point and Annapolis graduates—and despite their tradition of
                        not getting involved in politics could be relied upon to do their best for
                        their country if compelled to act. The President asked if they actually had
                        the political skill to run the country, and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> replied that they didn't but that
                        they would find someone to do the job for them. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> observed that things now were
                        nowhere near as bad as the circumstances which he had described, and that
                        the crisis point, if it came, was still quite a bit of time away. We would
                        need to keep watching the course of events, though. The President
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>The President wanted to know how <persName>Marcos</persName> was getting
                        along with respect to the Dovey Beams case. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> said that the case hadn't really
                        caused <persName>Marcos</persName> all that much difficulty, since
                        Philippine mores were quite different from our own. The only criticism of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> appeared to be over the fact that he got
                        caught out. Whatever he did, he shouldn't have let Miss Beams make tapes of
                        his liaison. According to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName>, Miss Beams was still trying to keep something of a
                        hold over <persName>Marcos</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">Telegram

                        the President agreed or disagreed. (The line taken by <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> had been that the Filipinos had to
                        decide the matter of recognition for themselves, but should weigh the
                        benefits which they expected to receive against the security problems which
                        would inevitably accompany the establishment of Eastern European or Soviet
                        missions.) The President declared that he thought the line by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> was the correct one. Of
                        course, we would not be happy if the Philippines recognized the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and this would also be harmful to the
                        Philippines. However, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> was correct in saying that the Filipinos had to
                        decide things such as these themselves. He had long ago adopted the maxim of
                        not trying to argue against something which somebody else had already
                        decided to do. The only thing was, that if the Filipinos decided to go ahead
                        they should give us some advance warning so we could use this matter in our
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We might want to
                        go to the Soviets and tell them that the Filipinos had asked our advice on
                        recognition and we had told them to go ahead. In this way, we might get some
                        credit for the Philippine action.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> stated that he was
                        not sure the Filipinos actually intended to go ahead. A while ago it had
                        seemed almost certain that they would, but there had been some drawing back
                        from establishing relations with the Communist world in recent weeks. Eight
                        Philippine Senators were now against this policy, and if
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> were to move today he would not be able to
                        gain approval from the Philippine Senate.</p>
                    <p>During the conversation Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName> expressed the opinion that we were taking the
                        Philippines too much for granted. We had taken over eight months on <gloss
                            target="#t_PL4801">PL–480</gloss> negotiations without reaching
                        agreement, and the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for the Philippines
                        had been cut from $20 million to $17 million and then to $13 million. Even
                        though these cuts had been restored, the Filipinos weren't happy, and they
                        would be less so when they found that the <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> for Indonesia was larger than theirs. They had no
                        particular use for the Indonesians, and American interests in Indonesia were
                        less than in the Philippines. Actions of ours of this nature were regarded
                        as a “slap in the face from Father.”</p>

                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is basically favorable, while adding the

                            >ADB</gloss>, and greater emphasis on sector-wide planning. Assuming

                        considerations which I believe support a decision to implement this program
                        as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>It has been characteristic of the Philippines that the pace of infrastructure
                        development and modernization has been too slow to meet the expectations of
                        a rapidly growing Philippine population.</p>
                    <p>In order to overcome a critical balance of payments crisis,
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> has conscientiously enforced the fiscal and
                        foreign exchange disciplines imposed a year ago by the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. This has led, however, to a slow-down in
                        the rate of economic growth and a 22 percent rise in consumer prices in
                        1970. Discontent and an anti-administration mood prevails among the
                        populace. Revolutionary extremists, operating provocatively through emergent
                        student activists and with the unwitting cooperation of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' conventional political opponents, are
                        creating serious political instability and fanning the danger of explosive
                        violence.</p>
                    <p>While this situation is partly of <persName>Marcos</persName>' own making—his
                        overkill tactics in the last Presidential elections, the popular belief that
                        he is amassing a large personal fortune from his Presidential office—the
                        fact is that explosive popular discontent stems to an important extent from
                        economic problems. For example, recent riots in which five were killed
                        stemmed from a strike of jeepney drivers supported by activist students.
                        Discontent could be reduced and popular confidence in the Philippines'
                        democratic structure of government strengthened by indications that the
                        country is moving forward with national economic <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501"
                            facs="0550"/>development. It is in our interest, as well as in that of
                        the Philippines, that this be achieved; and it is important that indications
                        of forward progress come now, before the internal political situation of the
                        Philippines further deteriorates.</p>
                    <p>Initiation of the long planned and impatiently awaited national
                        electrification program at this critical juncture could have a significant
                        favorable economic and political impact. Thus, I would urge that serious
                        consideration be given to the allotment of sufficient development loan funds
                        from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 to initiate this program with the

                        prepared by the Political Counselor of our Embassy in Manila. It illuminates
                        those positive and stabilizing aspects of Philippine society which we have
                        been groping to understand, but which are so often lost from view amid the
                        welter of daily events.</p>
                    <p>I agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> that
                        this paper displays real insights. Its main points are as follows:</p>
                    <p>—There is no argument about the lack of visible progress in dealing with the
                        Philippines' major problems; graft and corruption,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d235fn3">For a different view of corruption and the abuse of
                            power in the Philippines, see airgram A–4 from Cebu, February 8. (Ibid.,

                            n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0551"/>and order, the widening gap between
                        rich and poor, government inefficiency, and the inadequacies of top
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>—If there is general agreement that Philippine society is seriously ill,
                        there is also equally firm agreement that a revolutionary situation does not
                        exist. The reasons for the “perverse stability of this noisy, poorly
                        governed, disorderly, under-achieving society” are:</p>
                    <p>—There is a political system in the Philippines. The Constitution has been in
                        effect for 35 years without suspension or having been rewritten by a “strong
                        man.” Peaceful transfer of power repeatedly takes place. There is general
                        agreement that the system needs revision, but there is equal agreement that
                        the mechanism to bring about changes should be the Constitutional
                        Convention.</p>
                    <p>—In other developing countries of Asia we are concerned because the provinces
                        do not identify with the capital. This is definitely not the case in the
                        Philippines. A good internal civil air network, a nationwide radio network,
                        and an excellent newspaper distribution system provide good communication
                        within this society.</p>
                    <p>—The Filipino is addicted to elections and if much energy is absorbed in the
                        political game it fulfills the special purpose in the Philippines of serving
                        to deal with the oriental problem of face. The Filipinos are unusual in Asia
                        for knowing how to find a respected place for defeated ex-Presidents.<note

                            sentence (beginning with the word “how”) and wrote in the margin: “Like
                            Mexico.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—The Philippine press helps drain off revolutionary pressure. This is a
                        compulsively open society, where the life span of a secret is measured in
                        hours. Scandals are hyper-ventilated. After a while this produces not
                        indignation but boredom. A comparable phenomenon is indifference to student
                        martyrs. The normal level of casual violence is so high in the Philippines
                        that there is no general sense of outrage when a few students are shot.</p>
                    <p>—The private sector of the economy works well. The road to wealth is open to
                        the ordinary dishonest man. In most of developing Asia this road is
                        controlled by the military.</p>
                    <p>—The Filipino is less interested in good government than in government that
                        is good to him. Like a gambler in Las Vegas, the system may wipe him out,
                        but he is no more interested than the gambler in changing it. Tomorrow he
                        may strike it lucky.</p>
                    <p>—Sheltered in his extended family system, linked by dual tires of loyalty and
                        obligation upward and downward in the social structure, the Filipino is
                        almost never alone, either actually or figuratively. The <pb n="503"
                            xml:id="pg_503" facs="0552"/>individual loneliness and alienation that
                        is deeply troubling the society of the West is almost unknown in the
                        Philippines. This is perhaps the essential reason why the average Filipino
                        is optimistic about the future. To the despair of the revolutionaries, he
                        has not lost his sense of humor, he is not bitter.</p>
                    <p>—What are the limits? How much more can the long-suffering Filipino take
                        before he accepts the arguments of those favoring violent change? Consensus
                        for change develops slowly in a democracy, and if the needed change is basic
                        as it is in the Philippines, it often takes a severe crisis to generate and
                        sustain the consensus.</p>
                    <p>—The alternative to peaceful reform in the Philippines is probably not
                        revolution but anarchy. Those who try to end the anarchy may come from
                        either the Right or Left but they will have to accept the fact that the
                        Filipino will not tolerate too much government. He will be intractable and
                        rebellious if his individualistic way of life is denied him.</p>
                    <p>—The democratic values which the U.S. planted in the Philippines have now
                        assumed their own indigenous forms. The roots are deep and if we have faith
                        in the capacity of our own society to change and survive, we cannot give up
                        hope for the Philippines.<note n="5" xml:id="d235fn5">At the end of the

                    <p>6405. 1. I do not want to clutter up the wires with the obvious, but I do
                        think I would be remiss if I did not report that the recent events started
                        by the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> disclosures, the Supreme Court
                        decision, et al, have had a great and injurious impact here. I have had long
                        talks on these matters with both <persName>Marcos</persName> and Romulo, in
                        each case at their <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0553"/>initiative.
                        Their immediate primary concern or course (in this continuing process, which
                        for here, started with the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>
                        Committee disclosures long ago) is what may yet come out to cause further
                        embarrassment to the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, and of course to
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> personally.</p>
                    <p>2. As an example, Romulo told me yesterday he was appalled by the publication
                        of the Lansdale Memo in 1961 indicating <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        support of, and implication with, three Philippine organizations, i.e., the
                        Eastern Construction Company, Operation Brotherhood, and Security Training
                        Center. I told him I had not seen that report and had only a hazy
                        recollection as to what two of these outfits were like in 1961. I added,
                        however, that there was certainly nothing sinister in our helping, if we did
                        in fact help, in any of these efforts, as all three in fact were in a good
                        cause. He said he agreed, but it was now being played in the light that it
                        was sinister, and that, especially as two of these endeavors still existed,
                        it could have serious and immediate local repercussions. (Unfortunately
                        friendly and helpful Congressman San Juan is in charge of the Eastern
                        Construction Company.) He said that it was so serious that he had asked for
                        a full study and the Philippine Embassy to send in the complete text of the
                        Lansdale Memo. Fortunately this particular disclosure has not as yet been
                        played in the local press, but I assume that it will be and most probably in
                        a sensational manner.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName>Marcos</persName>, in personal conversations, has never come
                        directly to the point, but occasionally phrases he uses could hardly have
                        any other meaning but to reflect concern on his part as to whether my own
                        reporting might be distributed widely and be leaked in Washington. Romulo,
                        more in sorrow than in anger, has gone much further and asked how any nation
                        can have the confidence to converse freely with our ambassadors in the
                        future. He hastened to add that this would be a tragedy, as he did not think
                        American motives bad, but that there would naturally be great mistrust in
                        doing sensitive things with us in the future. He thought <hi rend="italic"

                        time to come.</p>
                    <p>4. For my part I go through the obvious: that these are only <hi
                            rend="italic">Pentagon Papers</hi>, which to the exclusion of all other
                        relevant papers and records of discussions and decisions, leave a very
                        distorted picture, that this has been further exaggerated by the manner of
                        presentation, headline selection, etc. But, of course, there is really no
                        effective answer, and it would be impractical to attempt to portray by cable
                        all the local reactions, very many to me personally, on this subject.</p>
                    <p>5. But in summary I can say that we have suffered a very great loss indeed as
                        a nation in these events. In my opinion it goes beyond a fear by local and
                        high officials as to how it might affect them personally. <pb n="505"
                            xml:id="pg_505" facs="0554"/>The deeper loss of confidence reflects a
                        worry about the U.S. itself, which is considered important by every segment
                        of this country. I am not competent to know what steps we can take that
                        would be effective, but additional search, on the one hand, for ways of
                        assuring others that we have adequate laws to protect the security of our
                        own confidences of state in the field of foreign affairs (and hence those of
                        others), and on the other for ways of proving that we have the national will
                        to tighten our own security, and prosecute under the laws if necessary,
                        seems very definitely in order.</p>
                    <p>Even more difficult would be the search for forms of reassurance, in the case
                        of Asian nations particularly, that we are on an honest and open course with
                        them, in the interest of their own aspirations as well as our own.</p>

                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>, the hyperactive
                        Liberal Senator with a “maverick” reputation, reported that he will visit
                        the People's Republic of China for ten days in September with a group of
                        Filipino journalists. He was pessimistic about the prospects for the Liberal
                        Party in the November senatorial, provincial and local elections and about
                        the future of the Liberal Party and the two-party system in general in the
                        Philippines. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> does not exclude
                        the possibility of some sort of revolutionary upheaval in the Philippines
                        during the next four years and sought to leave the impression that he might
                        “go to the hills” as one of its leaders.</p>
                    <p>During a long merienda and introductory meeting at the Army-Navy Club on
                        August 11 for Political Counselor <persName corresp="#p_MFE1"

                        <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> made a number of interesting
                        comments that are worth recording.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Trip to Peking.</hi> Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> said that he would be leaving on September 2 for a
                        ten-day trip to Peking, Canton, Shanghai and, possibly, other cities in
                        Communist China. Accompanying him will be six Filipino journalists and two
                        TV cameramen who will stay in China for a total of thirty-five days and will
                        try to make a side trip to Pyongyang. The trip, which <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said is being sponsored by a
                        Chinese journalistic association, is for the purpose of familiarizing
                        themselves with current developments on the Mainland. (Although <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said that he had gone to Canton
                        with the Philippine Chamber of Commerce group that traveled to China in May,
                        we have no information that he actually went further than Hong Kong with the
                        group or received a visa to enter the Mainland. If <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> does, in fact, make the trip he
                        says he will, he will be the most senior Philippine official to visit
                        Peking.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The 1971 Elections.</hi> Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> was pessimistic about the Liberal
                        Party's prospects for this November's elections. Only two Liberal candidates
                        (Salonga and either Magsaysay or Osmena) would be elected to the Senate, and
                        the Liberals would fare badly in gubernatorial and mayoralty contests.
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> complained, is buying off Liberal candidates with
                        money or political appointments and has already persuaded eleven potential
                        Liberal gubernatorial candidates not to run; four of these were confirmed on
                        the day of our conversation as new Court of First Instance judges.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> showed us the results
                        of a recent poll conducted nationwide by the Liberal Party. The poll, which
                        had 2,800 respondents, confirmed his conclusions that the Liberals would not
                        do well in the senatorial election. Of the issues that respondents were
                        asked to identify as the most urgent problems presently facing the
                        Philippines, high prices and the need for public works ran far ahead of
                        graft and corruption and criticism of the <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        Administration. The Nacionalistas, according to <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName>, had conducted a separate poll with similar results,
                        with Senator Almendras emerging as the most popular candidate from either
                        party. When we pointed out that high prices and the need for public works
                        were issues that the Liberals could readily use in their campaign, <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> replied that this was not the case;
                        instead, what counted was how the voters, two-thirds of whom live in rural
                        areas, would respond to these issues at the time of election. Their memory
                        is short and their impressionability high, and between now and election day
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would dispense considerable amounts of “pork
                        barrel” funds for local high-impact public works projects and would import
                        enough rice to keep the price of this essential commodity down. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> appeared to place great stock in
                        the value of his polls. He went over them column by column and figure by
                        figure and gave no sign of questioning the validity of the statistics he
                        quoted. As a practical politician, <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0557"
                        />he said, he has his office conduct a nationwide poll of issues every 45
                        days, paying particular attention to identifying issues connected in the
                        popular mind with certain Senators. Little nationwide impact resulted,
                        according to his poll, from his Congressional budget and fund transfer
                        campaign; Senator Magsaysay, however, drew high marks on land reform even
                        though, according to <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>,
                        Magsaysay “never opens his mouth on this issue.”</p>
                    <p>The Liberal Party is in danger of extinction, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> continued. President <persName>Marcos</persName> has
                        changed the traditional rules of the political game in the Philippines by
                        spending unprecedented sums of money to ensure the election of himself and
                        other Nacionalista candidates. The Liberals can no longer compete on this
                        basis; they need 500,000 pesos per province per year (68 provinces) just to
                        operate their party organization, let alone to pay for the costs of an
                        election, and raising the necessary funds is becoming increasingly
                        difficult. President <persName>Marcos</persName> will spend freely on the
                        1971 elections, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> claimed, and
                        has already started doing so by passing out two thousand pesos to each of
                        the twenty-seven thousand barrio captains in the country. In addition,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> states that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> now owns directly or controls through
                        various means, 220 of the approximately 290 radio stations in the
                        Philippines and has managed to prevent criticism in all of the major
                        newspapers except the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle and the
                            Times-Mirror-Taliba</hi> group. Mandy Elizalde (described by <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> as a political nobody whose
                        inclusion on the Nacionalista slate was intended to prove that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> can get anyone elected) puts the Elizalde
                        Tri-Media behind the Nacionalistas. (<persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName>'s claim of the extent of <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                        control over radio broadcasting is open to doubt since the Lopez-owned
                        ABS–CBN system owns a sizeable percentage of the broadcasting industry. As
                        for newspapers, his remark is misleading since the circulation of the <hi

                            >Chronicle</hi> is considerably greater than that of all the other major
                        papers combined.)</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>'s comments on the future of
                        the Liberal Party led him into a discussion of his own future political role
                        and revolutionary political change in general in the Philippines. Since
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had, by his overspending on elections,
                        blocked the traditional avenues of access to political power for the
                        Liberals, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said he was left
                        with three choices for his own future: 1) allow himself to be bought off by
                        the Nacionalistas (Nacionalista Senator Jose Roy, <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> related, had recently orally
                        invited <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> on
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' behalf to be the Senate's representative on
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> delegation to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly and, upon his return, become
                        the head of the Philippine National Bank. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> said he asked for the offer in writing from
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, thus effectively declining the probe); 2)
                        “hang up my shingle” and retire from politics; or 3) “go to the hills” and
                        join the revolution. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> implied
                        that he was considering the third choice. Polls conducted <pb n="509"
                            xml:id="pg_509" facs="0558"/>by his office had shown that in response to
                        the question “How would you react if a senator went to the hills?” 34% of
                        the respondents said they would approve; two years ago the response was only
                        19%. A question on whether or not the respondent would approve of a
                        revolutionary change of government in the Philippines produced a similar
                        response. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> stated that his
                        fellow Liberal Senator Jose Diokno has decided against the idea of “going to
                        the hills” for the moment; <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>,
                        however, left the impression that this course was not excluded for himself.
                        He thought a revolutionary leader of sufficient prominence would have little
                        difficulty in gaining support from the peasants and that financial support
                        would come from the urban middle class and some of the wealthy who were
                        disenchanted with the <persName>Marcos</persName> Administration.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said that he believed that
                        there could be a revolution in the Philippines sometime between now and 1974
                        or 1975. Underlying his comments on this subject was a fairly clear
                        indication that <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> is in active
                        contact with KM leaders both in and outside Manila. For example, he reported
                        that radical leaders had decided to change the tactics of their guerrilla
                        activities. Starting in September they planned to place their emphasis on
                        increased urban terrorism rather than on terroristic activities in the
                        provinces which they felt were not having the desired impact. (This tends to
                        support similar reports heard from other sources.) He noted that the number
                        of students who have received two or three months of guerrilla training in
                        the hills and who have returned to the cities is growing, and their tactics
                        have become more sophisticated. In the future, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> thought that there will be fewer direct
                        confrontations with the police and Philippine Constabulary and more use of
                        sniping, arson, bombing and other forms of selective terrorism.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> was becoming more and more of a dictator and
                        was gaining control of the government and the country in line with his
                        alleged intentions of continuing to stay in power beyond the end of his
                        second term in 1973. Thus <persName>Marcos</persName>' present actions and
                        future ambitions, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> argued,
                        were creating a revolutionary situation for the Philippines. While <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said he could not predict with
                        precision when a revolution would occur, he said that one of the key factors
                        that any revolutionary must consider and which at present was unclear was
                        the position the United States would take in a revolutionary situation in
                        the Philippines.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> can be prone to exaggeration, and his remarks on the
                        possibility of revolution and the role that he might play as one of its
                        leaders seemed quite farfetched. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName>, who is a longtime and prominent critic of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, has no political ideology beyond his own
                        personal ambitions. In this respect, his discussion of revolution can be
                        interpreted as meaning that, if the Philippine political <pb n="510"
                            xml:id="pg_510" facs="0559"/>system has been changed to the extent that
                        his political clique cannot alternate in power with the Marcoses by
                        democratic means, then it will become necessary to resort to violent
                        revolution as the means of gaining power. Although <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> is believed to maintain regular
                        contact with the Huks and the <gloss target="#t_NPA1">NPA</gloss>, the jump
                        from being a potential Liberal Party candidate for the 1973 Presidential
                        election to leading a revolution in the hills may be a bit too much for the
                        “boy wonder of Tarlac” to make.</p>

                    <p>8351. 1. I literally do not have time prior to my departure from here for
                        detailed reporting on a long talk with <persName>Marcos</persName> alone
                        today, and later on with Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> alone, and finally
                        with the two of them together.</p>
                    <p>2. As it turned out it was a bad day indeed to see
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> as there were two or three hundred people in
                        Malacanang on a whole series of important meetings and he actually had about
                        100 waiting for him when I left. In the turmoil I ran into Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> by accident and walked over to say goodbye.
                        She took me in the music room for about an hour's conversation. Her main
                        concern seemed to be some doubt as to our support of the President in
                        present circumstances, or as she put it, in his struggle to rid the country
                        of Communist subversive operations. I told her she need have no worry on the
                        latter, but went on to explain my concern that the President's actions to
                        suspend the <hi rend="italic">writ</hi> coming as it did in an election
                        period, might well be misunderstood abroad. I tried to draw her out as to
                        what had to happen, as she saw things, before he could raise the suspension,
                        but did not get anything very specific. She went into long stories as to the
                        nature of their evidence, as of now, implicating <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> and possibly others.</p>
                    <p>3. I told her I would face many questions at home, and some in which I had no
                        answers. I said the first question that everyone would ask me is “Who did it
                        at Plaza Miranda?”<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">The Plaza Miranda incident
                            refers to an indiscriminate terrorist attack by unknown assailants who
                            tossed two grenades there into a rally of the opposition Liberal Party
                            on August 21. President <persName>Marcos</persName> responded by
                            suspending the writ of habeas corpus for suspected subversives.
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> also caused the detention of a number of
                            persons without formal charges and immediately came under suspicion of
                            exploiting the situation to stifle opposition elements, according to

                            facs="0560"/>be the “I do not know.” The next question would be “Who do
                        you think did it?” I told her my answer to that one would also have to be “I
                        don't know.” I said this would put me somewhat on the defensive in
                        Washington which was unfortunate as there were positive things that I wanted
                        to work on there.</p>
                    <p>4. Later on as I was sitting down with the President, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MI1">Imelda</persName> asked to see him before his talk with
                        me. When I later joined the President in his private library, he said that I
                        had left the First Lady quite agitated and worried, with her worry centering
                        on my remarks in the quotes above. <persName>Marcos</persName> said I must
                        know that he had not suspended the <hi rend="italic">writ</hi> solely on the
                        Plaza Miranda incident, as he had stated publicly, that this was only the
                        last straw. He said he was determined, during the period of the suspension
                        of the <hi rend="italic">writ</hi>, to break the back of Communist-led
                        insurgency in the Philippines, even though this might take some time. He
                        assured me that he would not misuse the suspension for political purposes,
                        or against personal enemies. Interestingly, he said that it would not be
                        difficult to have the constitutional convention extend his tenure of office,
                        but that he was not going to do that. He said he would retire in 1973 unless
                        at the time the country seemed in such a condition that he could not
                        conscientiously leave the office of the President.</p>
                    <p>5. I said that from all evidence we had it appeared that his people were
                        operating under the suspension in quite a proper and legitimate manner. I
                        said unfortunately, however, as long as the suspension was in effect he
                        would be accused by his enemies of misusing it no matter what he did. He
                        said he knew that was true, but there came a time in the life of many
                        presidents where they had to become immune to criticism and he had
                        personally passed that stage. He repeated that the affairs of the nation
                        under the suspension would be handled properly, and said further that in the
                        two years he had left he was going to institute significant reforms.</p>
                    <p>6. Our conversation then turned to the long list of specifics that I had
                        prepared to take up with him prior to my departure. These need not be
                        reported now except for matters connected with Clark Field.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> told me that he would sign the transfer
                        orders of Judge Gaddi from the Angeles area today. He said it made him wince
                        to have to “promote” Gaddi to get him out of our hair, but he would do it,
                        and do it right away. He also phoned the Solicitor General in my presence
                        and directed him to take any steps necessary to get Airman Whipkey out of
                        jail in Angeles.</p>
                    <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0561"/>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Imelda</persName> joined us and the three of us
                        had a re-hash of her concern as to what I would say in Washington. It all
                        ended amicably enough, but it is clear that she is somewhat worried. While
                        this at times makes life a bit complicated for me here, I think I left her
                        with just about the right amount of concern. I am not worried about the
                        President as he is less emotionally inclined and I think respects and
                        understands the position of the American Ambassador here far better than
                        she. In any event, we will know in due course. I am leaving here by Pan
                        American tomorrow. My itinerary will be sent separately.</p>

                    <p>1. Participants: Philippines—<gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> Romulo,
                        PermRep Reyes; <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>— The Secretary, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG3">Murphy</persName> (reporting officer).</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: Romulo said there were some subversive demonstrations in the
                        Philippines and the Philippine Army needs <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        support on training and equipment. The Secretary said the military situation
                        in Viet-Nam is good and even the other side must acknowledge it. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Asked about the situation in the Philippines, Romulo said there had been
                        several subversive demonstrations including a recent bombing of an electric
                        plant, and that those responsible are Maoists. Consequently, he said, it is
                        against President <persName>Marcos</persName>' inner convictions to vote for
                        the entry of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> into the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary observed that <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine relations were excellent, and
                        Romulo said much credit should be given to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>, who was the best <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Ambassador the Philippines had had, and
                        enjoys the respect and confidence of both the President and himself. The
                        Secretary stated that things looked good in Viet-Nam at the moment and that
                        although we were disappointed by the Presidential election, because
                            <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> could have won even with
                        opposition, South Viet-Namese forces were fighting well and <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> casualties were very low. Romulo asked if
                        South Viet-Nam could handle the military situation by itself if <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces withdrew, including <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air forces. The Secretary said that the South
                        Viet-Namese could make it without <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ground
                        forces, but the President had not yet decided how long <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air power would be used. He said the other
                        side also thinks the South Viet-Namese can do it on their own and that in
                        recent conversations with the Russians they had acknowledged this. Romulo
                        said his country would like to know what plans the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> had to train the Philippine Army and what equipment they
                        could get from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. He remarked that the
                        Philippines was not getting sufficient training or equipment at present. The
                        Secretary asked how many insurgents were active in the Philippines, and
                        Romulo said about 3,000, who were getting their equipment from Viet-Nam. He
                        said President <persName>Marcos</persName> strongly desires to see his army
                        properly trained and equipped. The Secretary inquired if the Philippine
                        Government was in touch with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military
                        on this, and Romulo replied that they were, through the Mutual Defense
                        Board. The Secretary promised to look into the matter and discuss it again
                        with Romulo, and Romulo suggested that the Secretary could pass the message
                        through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>. He
                        commented that the problem of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        surcharge on Philippine sugar seems to be solved now, and said much of the
                        credit for that belongs to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                            >Byroade</persName>.</p>

                        <persName>Marcos</persName> made a trip to the United States in October 1971
                        and requested meetings with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> and other high-level U.S. officials. The following

                    <p>The President welcomed Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> and asked for her
                        appraisal of the Iranian 2500th Birthday Celebration. Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> said that it had been a remarkable assembly
                        of world leaders. While she could not judge its economic costs, she did
                        believe that the exposure of the leaders of so many different political
                        ideologies could not but have had a constructive influence on world peace.
                        She had again had an opportunity to talk with Vice President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AST1">Agnew</persName>, she noted, and jokingly commented
                        that many in the press had assumed that their identical conservative
                        attitudes made them natural allies. Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        described <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0565"/>the atmosphere in Tehran
                        as almost fairy-tale-like in its simplicity, with world leaders of different
                        viewpoints all seated at the same dinner table, indulging in frivolous games
                        and a kind of light and good-humored banter which was almost childlike in
                        nature. The days were extremely hot and the nights chilly, and the Iranians
                        had gone all-out to provide adequate and colorful facilities for the
                        celebration. Many tents had been erected to house the various activities and
                        each was decorated in a unique color scheme of its own.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the Shah of Iran was a strong and selfless
                        leader who was a great favorite of his and who had generously and
                        progressively exploited and distributed Iran's great oil revenues to the
                        benefit of his people. He noted that while perhaps Iran's formal government
                        did not meet the idealistic criteria of many critics, it was perhaps the
                        best system for Iran at this point in history since it provided for strong
                        leadership at the center.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then asked Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> to comment on the internal situation in the
                        Philippines, recalling his discussions with Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        in September 1970. Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> stated that all of the
                        things that she had predicted with the President at their earlier meeting
                        had come to pass. Internal disorders and efforts by extremists to discredit
                        the <persName>Marcos</persName> Government had increased in intensity and
                        culminated in the detonation of a grenade at a meeting of the liberal party
                        leadership. She stated that this, of course, was contrived to make it appear
                        as though President <persName>Marcos</persName> had been behind the
                        incident. She stated that Communist activity was also increasing and that
                        the Communist insurgents in the Philippines had achieved a degree of greater
                        self-confidence as a result of recent events, to include perhaps even
                        announcement of the President's visit to Peking. She noted, however, that
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> understood the purposes of the
                        President's visit, even though many Asian leaders were concerned and worried
                        by its implications.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> emphasized that his
                        visit to Peking should not be misinterpreted. He was traveling there with
                        his eyes open and would not under any circumstances sacrifice the interests
                        of America's traditional friends. The 300 million people of Asia who formed
                        an arc around the periphery of Communist China—Thailand, Malaysia,
                        Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea—produced far more
                        than all of Mainland China and constituted the bedrock base of freedom in
                        the area. No American President could sacrifice the interests of any member
                        of this essential arc in favor of progress in our relationships with Peking.
                        On the other hand, the President pointed out, certainly the time had come to
                        at least start talking to Peking's leadership in the interest of stability
                        in the area and world peace in general. Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        assured the President that she understood this, as did her husband. <pb
                            n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0566"/>Nevertheless, she said, a certain
                        nervousness had resulted. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> assured Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> that he would
                        keep President <persName>Marcos</persName> fully apprised on a consultative
                        basis with respect to both the meeting in Peking and his meeting in Moscow
                        which was equally significant in terms of world peace.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked what the Philippines needed at present. Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> replied that her husband had been most
                        grateful for the United States action on the Philippine sugar quota. The
                        President commented that he had taken this action because of his special
                        feeling for the Philippines and at some expense to our relationships with
                        friends in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> then stated that the Philippines need
                        additional military assistance and felt that it would be most helpful if
                        some of the equipment which the United States used in South Vietnam could be
                        made available to her government as the U.S. presence was reduced. Her
                        husband had asked her to mention this to the President and was particularly
                        interested in helicopters, ammunition, and small arms, all of which could be
                        used for internal security purposes. The President instructed General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> to look into the
                        Philippines' requirements and to view them with sympathy in light of our
                        overall plans.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> then stated that there were many, some of
                        whom were in the U.S. Embassy in Manila, who expected the Philippines to
                        react as an American puppet. She stated that this could not be, for both
                        substantive and political reasons, and many times she and her husband were
                        forced to take positions which did not necessarily meet U.S. conceptions. On
                        the other hand, this in no way should be interpreted by U.S. officials as a
                        departure by the Philippine leadership from its longstanding and traditional
                        pro-U.S. stance. Quite the contrary, President <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        had recently taken a poll of Filipino attitudes with respect to the United
                        States. The remarkable outcome of this poll indicated that in the rural
                        areas in the Philippines a majority of the citizenry expressed a desire to
                        become a state of the United States of America. She cautioned the President
                        to keep this in mind when he received reports from the Embassy in Manila or
                        when he was exposed to Manila press interpretations suggesting a growing
                        anti-U.S. climate. The President expressed sympathy with President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' problem. He stated that obviously no leader
                        of the Philippines could assume a puppet stance and we would not want or
                        expect this. He said even a traditional friend like Great Britain was forced
                        to demonstrate its independence from the United States from time to time.
                        Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> stated that she had spoken recently to
                        Prime Minister Heath and that he had mentioned to her his desire to explain
                        U.S. policies to the other powers in a constructive way, thus confirming his
                        friendship for the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0567"/>
                    <p>As the meeting adjourned, Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> gave the President
                        a letter from President <persName>Marcos</persName> (attached)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d243fn2">Attached but not printed. The text of
                                <persName>Marcos</persName>' October 8 letter was forwarded to the

                        internal situation in the Philippines continued to deteriorate as a result
                        of some subversive activity by the Communists. For this reason, she said, it
                        might be important to modify the Philippines Constitution to permit a strong
                        and consistent leadership by President <persName>Marcos</persName> after the
                        termination of his Presidential term in office. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> did not comment on this remark.</p>
                    <p>The President then escorted Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> to Rose Mary
                        Woods' office and from there to the White House Mess, where he introduced
                        her to the Cost of Living Council. Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> made a
                        brief speech to the group reiterating the warm friendship of the people of
                        the Philippines for the people of the United States and informing them of
                        the results of President <persName>Marcos</persName>' poll.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>It was a great pleasure for me to see Mrs. <persName>Marcos</persName> once
                        again during her recent visit to Washington and to receive from her your
                        letter of October 8, 1971. Her account of the Persepolis celebrations was
                        most interesting, and I also appreciated the chance to talk with her about
                        the situation in the Philippines. I hope she enjoyed her short visit to the
                        United States as much as we enjoyed having her here.</p>
                    <p>Your kind words of support for my coming trip to Peking are greatly
                        appreciated. As you are aware, our efforts to establish a new relationship
                        with the People's Republic of China are based on my conviction that all
                        nations will benefit if relations between the United States <pb n="519"
                            xml:id="pg_519" facs="0568"/>and the People's Republic are improved. It
                        is good to know that you feel tensions in Asia have already lessened as a
                        result of our initiatives.</p>
                    <p>I was deeply gratified for your Government's decision to support our efforts
                        to secure continued representation for the Republic of China in the United
                        Nations—at the same time that we supported representation for the People's
                        Republic of China in that body. I am sure that you share our disappointment
                        that the General Assembly rejected the resolutions we both cosponsored.
                        Throughout this difficult test I was heartened by the unstinting cooperation
                        of the Philippines and others among our allies and friends. Please convey my
                        compliments to Foreign Secretary Romulo, Ambassador Jimenez, Ambassador
                        Yango, and other members of your Foreign Department for their excellent
                        performance.</p>
                    <p>Now that the majority has spoken we will, of course, accept its decision. You
                        can be sure that the United States will perservere in the effort to make the
                        United Nations a more effective institution, and that we look forward to
                        continuing our close cooperation with the Philippines in working toward that
                        goal.</p>
                    <p>I was pleased that you were able to receive Secretary Connally during his
                        recent visit<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">Connally's trip to the Philippines

                    <p>Again, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and I were very

                    <p>1189. For Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>1. Please convey orally following message to President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>. Explain that the President has asked you
                        personally to make this presentation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Begin message:</hi> Before visiting Peking and Moscow the
                        President is consulting with several heads of friendly and allied
                        governments. He would have liked to have had an opportunity to get together
                        with President <persName>Marcos</persName> in the course of these
                        consultations. Unfortunately it is now clear that that will not be
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>While the President very much regrets this, he is mindful that he and
                        President <persName>Marcos</persName> have kept in close touch with one
                        another's thinking on key issues. The President was pleased that Mrs.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> was able to visit the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> in October and meet with him. He was grateful that President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> received Secretary Connally last month and
                        engaged in a frank exchange of views with him. Finally, the exchange of
                        letters between President <persName>Marcos</persName> and himself has, he
                        feels, very usefully clarified our two countries' mutual understanding on
                        important problems of common interest.</p>
                    <p>The President now wants to let President <persName>Marcos</persName> know
                        what he is discussing during the Summit consultations.</p>
                    <p>Moscow Visit</p>
                    <p>The President during his current consultations is reviewing the general state
                        of relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, preparatory to
                        his visit to Moscow in May 1972. He is making it clear that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had no intention of “dealing over the heads”
                        of its friends and allies in any matter where their security interests might
                        be affected. For example, there have been no, and there will be no,
                        bilateral <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet negotiations on mutual
                        withdrawal of forces from Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President is indicating during the consultations that some concrete
                        progress might be made either before or during the Moscow visit in such
                        bilateral areas as arms control and economic relations.</p>
                    <p>Peking Visit The principle purpose of the President's visit is that the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and ourselves achieve a better
                        understanding of each others' positions, and <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521"
                            facs="0570"/>that we establish a continuing means of remaining informed
                        about these positions. In addition, he hopes that the two sides will be able
                        to agree on at least the beginning of exchanges in nonpolitical fields so
                        that our two peoples will begin to understand each other better.</p>
                    <p>The President is emphasizing that neither side is under any illusions as to
                        the depth and complexity of the differences that separate us. Having been
                        two decades in developing, these differences will not be easily resolved.
                        Nevertheless, we hope to make a beginning toward clarifying our positions
                        and toward working out the real differences that stand between us. To the
                        extent we are successful, we believe we will have helped reduce tensions in
                        Asia and the world, which should be of benefit to all nations.</p>
                    <p>The President is stressing that he has the interests of the Philippines and
                        our other friends and allies very much in mind. He has no intention of
                        concluding agreements at the expense of other countries; the talks will, in
                        fact, focus on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> bilateral issues. Given our differences, the question of
                        formal diplomatic relations will not arise. Nor will <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> treaty commitments with other countries be affected.</p>
                    <p>Economic Issues</p>
                    <p>The President is extremely pleased that agreement has been reached on the
                        realignment of exchange rates. This agreement—which is the basis for a
                        restoration of international monetary and financial stability—is a
                        manifestation of cooperation among the major trading nations to the mutual
                        advantage of all. It is, further, evidence that economic differences which
                        we may have with our trading partners can and will be solved amicably in a
                        spirit of international cooperation. It would be incorrect for China, the
                        Soviet Union, or any other nation to see such economic differences as
                        representing an opportunity to divide free world nations. <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Re. Assessment that U.S. interests in the Philippines
                            are not seriously imperiled</hi> by anticipated political and economic
                        evolution in the Philippines over the next five or six years.</p>
                    <p>a.) It should be heavily stressed that this assessment is based on an
                        assumption that the U.S. will allocate resources required for the courses of
                        action called for in Section II of this paper as needful to achieve
                        objectives numbers 3, 4, and 5 under part D of Section I.</p>
                    <p>b.) It is also based on an assessment that needed social reform will proceed
                        by evolutionary processes. If this process is frustrated by disruption of
                        the Philippines open democratic institutions, then the country could be
                        plunged into a deepening chaos in which all constructive interests would
                        suffer. The danger of such a disruption is more likely to arise from right
                        wing (oligarchs) attempts to arrest the evolutionary process or from a
                        Philippine President's attempt to perpetuate himself in power by illegal
                        means than from left wing attempts to accelerate or preempt the evolutionary
                        process through violent revolution.</p>
                    <p>c.) A major problem for the U.S. will be to avoid being identified, because
                        of our military and business interests in the Philippines, as the bulwark of
                        the oligarchy.</p>
                    <p>There are two special factors which may help us to avoid such identification.
                        These are the fact that the oligarchs are the chief advocates of
                        anti-American nationalism—a pseudo nationalism which they use as a device to
                        harass American business competition. Thus, the oligarchs themselves tend to
                        have an image as tormentors of American interests rather than as the
                        protected favorites of American power. The U.S. need not be regarded by the
                        discontented masses of people as allied with their oppressors.</p>
                    <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0572"/>
                    <p>The second of the two factors is that there exists still among the people of
                        the Philippines a great affection for the United States and an image of
                        Americans as friends who would like to help them improve their prospects in
                        life. In the Philippines there is no need for the United States to wind up
                        on the wrong side of social evolution or even of revolution, should that,
                        however defined, ultimately occur.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Status of Base Talks</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Except for some technical matters relating to exemption from the Philippine
                        taxes and exit and entry procedures for American personnel on the bases, the
                        principal issues remaining for negotiation are the tenure of the agreement
                        and criminal jurisdiction arrangements (particularly the extent of
                        Philippine participation in duty determination). Another possible issue is
                        the relinquishment of additional areas of base land. However, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>'s instructions already
                        authorize substantial land relinquishment, and we do not anticipate any
                        significant difficulty with this issue.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Military Assistance Program</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Dangerously low politically, particularly now when we are trying to complete
                        base negotiations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>
                        has been warning us for a year that we would need “some blue chips” to wind
                        up the <gloss target="#t_MBA1">MBA</gloss> revision negotiations on the hard
                        issues. Filipinos will think we are walking away from unspoken understanding
                        that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is in return for bases.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> will think that we are walking away from
                        what he, at least, had thought to be the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine concept that we would provide increased
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to help the Philippines prepare for
                        increased self-reliance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is dangerously low too in terms of
                            <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> need for improved capability to deal
                        with internal security problems. As a practical matter, the cuts which we
                        have already received in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 will
                        eliminate all of the capital improvement element of <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The problems inherent in this situation will be almost inconceivable
                        compounded by the new requirement that the Philippines reimburse us in local
                        currency for 10% of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. We have no idea
                        where the Philippine Government would get the money. Some 80% of the
                        Philippine military already goes just for payment of salary and allowances.
                        The prospect of <persName>Marcos</persName> asking the Philippine Congress
                        for an appropriation to pay this 10% at a time when <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> has already declined to the lowest when he may also find
                        himself faced with the necessity of seeking Philippine Senate approval of
                        revisions in the base agreement is bewildering to say the least.</p>
                    <p>Such a combination of events coupled with the exemption in the U.S.
                        legislation for countries whose <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is
                        explicit base rent, makes it almost inevitable that the Philippines will
                        demand explicit rent for our bases there. Perhaps anticipating that the
                            <gloss target="#t_MBA1">MBA</gloss> revisions may be <pb n="524"
                            xml:id="pg_524" facs="0573"/>hard to sell in the Philippines in any
                        event, <persName>Marcos</persName> has been publicly emphasizing the
                        “continued need for an American military umbrella over the Philippines for
                        some time to come.” But the unveiling of the 10% peso payment provision in
                        our declining <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> will probably be more than
                        Philippine public opinion can take.</p>
                    <p>In fact this 10% reimbursement requirement (which is contrary to the courses
                        of action prescribed in Section II of <gloss target="#t_PARA1">PARA</gloss>)
                        could be of such serious dimensions as to undermine the first premise set
                        out in the issues paper.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Trade and Investment Relationship</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The latest statement of our strategy is contained in the joint State/Commerce
                        message of last January 1972.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Are the Philippine Military Bases Essential?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Judging from NISM 69 and the circular telegram now in clearance process, one
                        deduces that our bases in the Philippines are essential to the U.S. posture
                        in the Western Pacific and that they will become more valuable to us in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Not only is this eventuality being taken into consideration in our current
                            <gloss target="#t_MBA1">MBA</gloss> negotiations, it is the principal
                        reason why the current negotiations are being undertaken. If we foresaw the
                        diminishing need for the bases we could probably have lived with the
                        existing <gloss target="#t_MBA1">MBA</gloss>, enduring for a few years
                        longer the increasing harassment and friction we had been experiencing
                        before the <gloss target="#t_MBA1">MBA</gloss> talks were undertaken.</p>
                    <p>The objective of the current talks is to put the <gloss target="#t_MBA1"
                            >MBA</gloss> on an up-to–date basis which takes cognizance of new
                        Philippine sensitivities about their sovereignty and which will make for
                        improved U.S.-Philippine relations on base issues, thereby making it easier
                        and pleasanter to operate our bases in the Philippines over the long
                        pull.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that since we began the base talks last February, base relations
                        have been much improved. The only and glowing exception is the trouble we
                        are having with Judge Gaddi's challenge of the validity of the custody
                        receipt. Gaddi has not been supported by the Philippine Government in this.
                        In fact, the Philippine Executive Branch has supported us against Gaddi. The
                        Philippine Government itself is being harassed by Gaddi's almost fanatical
                        preoccupation with the august dignity of his court. He has harassed us by
                        citing our base commanders and unit commanders for contempt and ordering
                        their arrest whenever an American serviceman subpoenaed or charged in his
                        court was late to or missed a scheduled court appearance. Early in February
                        Gaddi cited the Philippine Secretary of Justice for contempt and ordered his
                        arrest and imprisonment because no one from the Justice Department appeared
                        in Gaddi's Angeles City court in response to a subpoena of the Justice
                        Secretary.</p>

                    <p>However, if the <gloss target="#t_MBA1">MBA</gloss> talks fail, we can expect
                        a recrudescence of the kind of general harassment and press and public
                        hypersensitivity on base incidents involving Filipinos which had plagued us
                        in the past; and by a practical matter rendered our use of the bases
                        increasingly difficult and our tenure increasingly insecure.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Various Proposals for Consolidated Use of U.S. Inputs as
                            Leverage to Obtain Protection of U.S. Interests</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two basic dangers in this concept. The first of these is that each
                        U.S. input already has a specific purpose which is being accomplished. If we
                        try to make an existing input into a bargaining lever to achieve some
                        secondary or tertiary objective unrelated to the basic purpose, we run the
                        risk of undermining or sacrificing the basic purpose. Therefore, the concept
                        would be valid only if the secondary or tertiary objective was so closely
                        intertwined with the basic objective that all could be accomplished with the
                        same leverage.</p>
                    <p>The second and perhaps far greater danger in the concept is that where the
                        proposal is to combine all U.S. inputs into a single lever to compel the
                        Philippine oligarchy to extend benefits of concessions to direct U.S.
                        interests such as bases or business interests, we may:</p>
                    <p>a) Make our interests and inputs hostage to the Philippine oligarchy (if we
                        can lever the oligarchy, they can by the same device put the squeeze on U.S.
                        interests in order to get more U.S. input—and, as a matter of fact, the
                        oligarchy has for a long time been smarter at this than we have);</p>
                    <p>b) Use up resources which we could otherwise use to improve the chances for a
                        peaceful social evolution in the Philippines and diminish the danger of
                        chaos and explosive revolution—objectives 3, 4 and 5;</p>
                    <p>c) Lock ourselves in with the oligarchy (which is protecting our interests in
                        response to our leverage) as the enemies of the people.</p>
                    <p>One example of a type of leverage which we might use on the oligarchy would
                        be a requirement for social and economic benefits to sugar estate workers as
                        a condition for the Philippine sugar quota.</p>
                    <p>An example of a type of leverage we should not use would be economic aid as a
                        lever to obtain protection of vested rights after the expiration of
                        Laurel–Langley.</p>
                    <p>Note that the implication of such a leverage approach would be that if the
                        vested rights were not protected the economic aid would be reduced or
                        eliminated, thus reducing or eliminating many of our courses of action

                        reliability U.S.–Philippine relationships. Exchange of views was brisk and
                        penetrating, with questions to <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        reflecting deep anxieties of Philippine officialdom and public. Visit
                        greatly appreciated by <persName>Marcos</persName> and extremely helpful

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> met with President

                        accompanied by John Holdridge, Consul General Osborn, and Ambassador.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had present General Romulo, Finance
                        Secretary Virata, Executive Secretary Melchor, and two DFA officials.</p>
                    <p>2. After brief exchange of warm and friendly greetings during photography,

                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' greetings, which he did later) into
                        series of pointed questions related to implications of President's Peking
                        visit and the communiqué for future U.S. policy and behavior toward East
                        Asia and most specifically Taiwan and the Philippines. It was more than an
                        hour before any curiosity was expressed as to Chinese side of the coin or
                        Chinese views on particular issues and problems. Main themes are
                        summarized:</p>
                    <p>A. <persName>Marcos</persName> asked first about an apparent contradiction
                        between U.S. acceptance that Taiwan is an internal Chinese problem and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s reaffirmation of U.S.
                        defense commitment to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. In the ensuing
                        discussion both <persName>Marcos</persName> and Romulo had considerable
                        difficulty distinguishing between <persName>Marcos</persName>' formulation
                        and the communiqué language of “acknowledging” and “not challenging” the
                        view of Chinese on both sides of the Strait. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> carefully explained deliberate U.S. decision to leave
                        undetermined position on “One China”, “Two Chinas”, “One China—One Taiwan”,
                        etc. It became apparent Romulo had not really understood, through period of
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debate on admission of <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, the deliberate care in wording of U.S.
                        position on dual <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0576"/>representation.
                        This lack of understanding accounts for his recent feelings that he had been
                        betrayed by what he saw as U.S. switch from “Two Chinas”—a position he had
                        supported vigorously in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—to what he has
                        considered new “One China” stance.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName>Marcos</persName> then asked whether U.S. would challenge
                        actions taken by <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in accordance with its
                        stated policy on Taiwan—”Tell us your intentions; Taiwan is only 92 miles
                        north of Bosco” (northermost point in Philippines). <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reviewed President's interest and
                        efforts since 1967 through series of careful steps to find a way to deal
                        with the reality of China, to remove barriers to trade and travel, to avoid
                        Cold War rhetoric, to remove tensions in area and show <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> we are not trying to threaten or isolate
                        them. He said it has been made clear throughout that U.S. would stand by its
                        commitments to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and this had been stated
                        again while on the Mainland. He noted his belief that Peking does not, in
                        any event, want the U.S. withdrawal from Asia its propaganda has demanded
                        while Peking's problems with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Japan
                        are viewed so seriously. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        stressed the importance of some means for dealing with day-to-day problems,
                        which sterile Warsaw talks had failed to provide, and argued that communiqué
                        reflects major gain of taking pressure off U.S. on recognition issue.
                        Achievements of visit, he concluded, are what we need at this time and have
                        been obtained without undercutting U.S. or free Asian interests in this
                        area.</p>
                    <p>C. Pursuing his effort to pin down the U.S. intentions,
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> asked what will happen to Taiwan in the long
                        run. He asked <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> to convey to
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> his government's belief that
                        Philippines must prepare for the worst, that within ten years Taiwan will be
                        part of Communist China. He said this would threaten Philippine survival and
                        conditions may deteriorate to the point <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        will have to adopt options it would not like. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> said he considered this line of reasoning unnecessary.
                        The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is in a strong position, with
                        outlook for trade and investment and economic progress good in comparison
                        with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> referred to his talks in Taiwan, saying <gloss
                            target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders naturally not happy but that they
                        understand our reasons and their situation and prospects are not bad. He
                        made comparison with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> which faces
                        internal difficulties and severe external problems. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> sought to reassure
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> with respect to continuity of U.S. concern
                        for Philippines and other Asian friends, evoking special heritage
                        U.S.-Philippine relations, quoting from President's foreign policy report on
                        pillars of U.S. Asian policy and noting these have been reaffirmed since
                        visit, and declaring U.S. prepared to stand on its record compared with all
                        nations in history in living up to its undertakings.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> pursued his contention that communiqué says
                        U.S. will let time solve the problem of Taiwan without interfering and
                        referred to evidence he has that investors on Taiwan are offering to move
                        holdings to Philippines, Singapore and elsewhere. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> referred to conversations in Japan and Korea, where
                        similar concerns <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0577"/>have been
                        expressed, and said he felt, and our embassies have subsequently reported,
                        that leaders there now understand and are satisfied with our policy.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated that our willingness
                        to accept some future settlement between <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> did not mean that we are apathetic,
                        noting military aid and diplomatic relations would continue. Ambassador
                        noted tendency of public opinion to ignore military reality that <gloss
                            target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces are large and strong and 7th fleet
                        “remains out in front.”</p>
                    <p>D. Question from Romulo about communiqué statement on reduction of forces on
                        Taiwan led <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> to reaffirm the
                        statement, noting it is consistent with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine and that ultimate withdrawal is expressly
                        contingent on peaceful resolution of problem. He referred to information
                        previously conveyed by Ambassador on force deployments, assured
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> this position still stands and said <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would try to repeat this kind of
                        consultation from time to time. He said core elements will remain on Taiwan
                        until settlement, which may well take many years. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> confirmed, in response to President's question, that
                        U.S. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                            >GRC</gloss> cannot settle differences peacefully, but expressed some
                        confidence its contingency not real in light of Peking record since costly
                        Korean conflict of avoiding adventuristic actions. He noted evidence
                        including fact of President's visit that Peking wants some form of relations
                        with U.S., making them less likely to prejudice own interests by resort to
                        violence against Taiwan. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        expressed confidence we are on right track pursuing President's effort to
                        escalate toward peace rather than war.</p>
                    <p>E. Regarding prospects for U.S.–<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> formal
                        relations, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> suggested this not
                        likely soon because Peking won't agree while U.S.–<gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> relations are preserved. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> reiterated U.S. has obtained its short term objective,
                        that visits by representatives may in actuality be better than a resident
                        mission unable to operate in traditional fashion, in response to question
                        whether he would not soon establish a Chargé in Peking and “commercial”
                        representation in Taipei in British fashion.</p>
                    <p>F. When <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> not affected by China developments,
                        Romulo asked skeptically whether U.S. would still apply Article IV which is
                        limited to “Communist aggression”, “now that you are friends.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said there has been no change and U.S.
                        has record to prove we mean what we say. This exchange led on to discussion
                        of the incorporation of the “five principles.” <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> noted principles had always been unexceptionable,
                        though propaganda environment at Bandung had precluded U.S. acceptance in
                        1950s, and suggested we gain in capacity to hold Peking to performance if we
                        and Peking have stated our agreed support for five principles. This caused
                        Romulo to refer to “U.S. interference” in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> to respond with specific
                        reference to U.S. action in response to legitimate Cambodian call for help,
                        including citation of even <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s
                        October 1969 <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0578"/>complaint of North
                        Vietnamese aggression. When ousted, Sihanouk was in fact enroute to Moscow
                        and Peking for very purpose of seeking their restraint on Hanoi's
                        agression.</p>
                    <p>G. Discussion of U.S. bases in Philippines in this full meeting was brief,
                        with <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stating in response to
                        question there has been no short or long range change in our assessment of
                        their importance. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he had asked Adm.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCAJS1">McCain</persName> to obtain position on
                        future of bases from Washington. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        affirmed that U.S.-Philippine relationship is unimpaired and he would so
                        state to press on departure. <persName>Marcos</persName> expressed
                        appreciation, noting irresponsible opposition effort in his Congress and
                        consititutional convention on this issue.</p>
                    <p>H. To request for U.S. position of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>
                        neutralization proposal, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said it
                        is question for Southeast Asians to decide, U.S. considering it a worthy
                        objective but noting many problems including establishment of adequate
                        strength and stability to make it work.</p>
                    <p>I. <persName>Marcos</persName> expressed concern about Communist

                        <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> acknowledged this is still a
                        competitive world, said U.S. does not believe everything Peking says and
                        will remain on its mettle and alert. Consul General Osborn noted that Peking
                        frequently opts for diplomatic rather than military means of pressure when
                        choice exists, and <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> suggested
                        they likely will increasingly conclude that sponsorship of national
                        liberation movements is not useful. <persName>Marcos</persName> repeated his
                        misgivings, looking ahead 10–20 years, and <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> agreed it is important we all maintain adequate
                        strength. He noted that overwhelming popular support in United States for
                        President's China policy should strengthen his hand in Congress for totality
                        of Pres. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s policies and
                        programs including adequate military aid.</p>
                    <p>3. Even after the foregoing and more, <persName>Marcos</persName> returned to
                        theme that he had to find out exactly where we stand. Southeast Asian
                        leaders expect him to be in the know about U.S. policy, “but I am not.” He
                        said, “If your policy is to withdraw from Asia, just inform us.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> responded that the President had
                        personally charged him at end of China visit to convey to Asian friends and
                        allies that U.S. is not going to leave western Pacific but rather find right
                        way to remain. He said we should be and act confident, that Peking might be
                        hypocritical but we stand to gain to extent Peking follows norms of
                        international behavior. Urgent problems of environment, population, seabeds,
                        and outer space cannot be dealt with on global basis without including
                        China.</p>

                    <p>4. Romulo initiated discussion on related economic questions, asking whether
                        U.S. will shoot for retention of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                        World Bank; <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said U.S. will do
                        what it can to support China in international financial institutions. Virata
                        expressed concern about Phil problem in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        should <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> be dropped and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said he believed U.S. should give
                        strong support. Virata requested U.S. decision as soon as possible. Similar
                        concern expressed about <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, particularly as
                        it is located in Manila. Concerning trade, <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> leaders were informed <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>

                            >USSR</gloss> and that we judge trade will be limited and develop only
                        slowly.</p>
                    <p>5. Toward end of discussion, Phils inquired about:</p>
                    <p>A. Peking view of Japan (we said Peking very worried about revival of
                        militarism, though in fact internal restraints in Japan against militarism
                        remain very strong);</p>
                    <p>B. Whether China still thinks in terms of encirclement (yes, but Soviets have
                        replaced U.S. as number one threat and China may begin to perceive
                        advantages in our overall posture of involvement);</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> naval development (not yet a blue
                        water navy). Phils asked about following subjects which were identified as
                        not having been discussed during Peking visit: the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss> neutralization concept; Quemoy and Matsu; seabeds; and
                        the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName>Marcos</persName> took <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> away for half hour's private chat (<gloss
                            target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss>s). Interval provided opportunity for
                        remaining group to elaborate a number of points previously raised (e.g.,
                        dual representation). Romulo came around to agree that U.S. and <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> position on Taiwan are the same, when it
                        was stated we favor peaceful solution to be worked out by Chinese but will
                        not yield to a forcible settlement.</p>
                    <p>7. As <persName>Marcos</persName> walked back with <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> from private talk, he said the meeting had been
                        useful, that it is obvious we are on same wave length, and that he was
                        grateful to the President for sending <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> to visit.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Embassy will forward fuller assessment
                        after reactions to entire visit are registered. In brief, however, it is
                        clear to us that the deep doubts and suspicions <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        aired are real, shared within <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> as well as
                        in increasingly noisy public discussion here. The reported misunderstandings
                        and disbelief were undoubtedly somewhat exaggerated for test purposes and in

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Action Items</p>
                    <p>1. There was agreement that to require the Philippines to deposit 10 percent
                        of the value of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military assistance could
                        endanger the successful conclusion of our military base negotiations. The

                    <p>The challenge for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> over the next five
                        years—and so long as the bases remain of fundamental importance to us—will

                    <p>—to retain a satisfactory relationship with the Philippine Government that
                        will ensure continued availability of the bases; but</p>
                    <p>—to avoid giving the appearance in the Philippines that we are wedded to a

                    <p>We have had some success in recent years in reducing Philippine dependence on
                        the United States. These efforts should be continued.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, we should:</p>
                    <p>—Seek to reduce and eliminate the remaining elements of the “special
                        relationship” we have with the Philippines, emphasizing that excessive
                        dependence on the United States is neither in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> nor Philippine interest and that a policy based on mutuality
                        of interest will contribute to a healthier relationship.</p>
                    <p>—Continue to move as far as practicable from a bilateral to a multilateral
                        framework in our dealings with the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Keep our official presence to the minimum, consistent with our basing
                        requirements, eliminating operations that are not essential or serve only
                        marginal purposes.</p>

                    <p>Our relationship with <persName>Marcos</persName> should take into account
                        his increasingly controversial role in Philippine politics.</p>
                    <p>While continuing to work closely with <persName>Marcos</persName> as the
                        elected President, we will have to avoid identification as partisans of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, particularly with respect to a possible
                        move by <persName>Marcos</persName> to extend his incumbency beyond the
                        present constitutional limit. (See III B below.)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We should continue to avoid specific and public quid pro quo arrangements
                        because these would be more costly and difficult than the present relatively
                        modest military assistance program.</p>
                    <p>A tacit understanding has, in fact, long existed between the United States
                        and the Philippines that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military
                        assistance is a quid pro quo for otherwise rent free use of our bases.
                        Neither country has wished, however, to formalize this relationship into a
                        specific agreement that would formally tie <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> levels to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> base
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>To put the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine military relationship
                        on a quid pro quo basis would undermine the concept of mutual <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine defense interests in the area.
                        Moreover, the Philippines would presumably seek a substantial increase in
                        military aid if they were to regard the defense relationship in such stark
                        terms, shorn of the long standing perception of the bases as serving mutual
                        security interests.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The United States should continue to concentrate its security assistance on
                        improving Philippine internal security capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The demands on the Philippine security forces are likely to increase over the
                        next several years, reflecting mounting unrest both in the cities and
                        countryside. There is no evidence at this time that we incur any serious
                        political liabilities from our rule in support of this Philippine
                        program.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should continue to coordinate its

                    </p>
                    <p>The review reaffirmed the position adopted in 1965 that we should not seek an
                        extension of the Laurel–Langley Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, beyond 1974, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should
                        neither extend special bilateral tariff preferences nor request parity (or
                        equivalent) rights for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> business. At the
                        same time, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should try to persuade the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> that it is in the Philippines' own
                        interest to maintain a favorable climate for foreign investment.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the review noted that those American firms that will
                        clearly be affected by the termination of the Laurel–Langley Agreement have
                        by and large accepted this fact and have made or are making appropriate
                        adjustments in the arrangements under which they operate. Most <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> firms will probably be affected to some
                        degree by the termination, but the full impact on individual firms will not
                        be known until the courts have ruled on a number of legal questions.
                        Estimates of how much disinvestment may be required of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> firms therefore vary. According to a 1970
                        Embassy assessment, disinvestment (outright sale, moving to minority equity
                        position, sale of land in return for long-term leases, etc.) might be
                        somewhere around $160 million (out of a total <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> direct investment of about $1 billion). Most American firms
                        believe that they will be able to make sufficiently satisfactory adjustments
                        and will probably continue to do business in the Philippines.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">A. The Policy Problem</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Two assumptions set the framework for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        policy in the Philippines:</p>
                    <p>—First, our military bases are of fundamental importance to the United
                        States, at least for the foreseeable future. In fact, the bases are likely
                        to become more valuable if <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> base rights are
                        curtailed or restricted elsewhere in the Western Pacific.</p>
                    <p>—Second, if basic political, economic and social reforms are not soon
                        forthcoming, internal unrest is likely to mount. While it is generally
                        agreed that reasonable stability will probably be maintained over <pb
                            n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0583"/>the next four or five years, there
                        is considerable doubt whether the <persName>Marcos</persName> administration
                        and its successor (most likely again controlled by the oligarchy) will
                        institute the extensive reforms that are necessary to forestall rising
                        internal unrest over the longer term.</p>
                    <p>At present the situation in the Philippines is mixed: forces of reform are
                        gaining strength but are blocked by strong vested interests. On balance,
                        there is probably little the US can do directly to induce the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to institute the required reforms.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> is the first Philippine President ever elected
                        to a second term. Although it is charged that the
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> machine committed extensive fraud and
                        applied considerable pressure tactics, particularly in the second term
                        election, it is clear that in completely fraud-free elections
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would have been elected both times.
                        Furthermore, <persName>Marcos</persName>' opponents are not entirely
                        innocent of such practices.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> has been one of the best Presidents the
                        Philippines has had in terms of constructive accomplishments; and he has
                        been friendly to the United States. Now, however, he has become a highly
                        controversial figure, partly because of his presumed (but publicly denied)
                        desire to continue as President despite the constitutional prohibition
                        against a third term.</p>

                            30, among other messages, describes <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"

                        strongly negative. His 44 points apparently lay out the foreign policy
                        framework for his campaign for a presidential nomination. As such, they are
                        so drafted as to seem more pro-Filipino than anti-American and leave plenty
                        of room for maneuver. While you are the better judge, I would imagine the
                        points would receive a good local press. Thus, I doubt we can gain much by
                        attacking him on these points, and we would run serious risk of appearing to
                        attempt to inject ourselves into domestic political conflicts.</p>
                    <p>2. His follow-up remarks on the relationship of the bases to the Vietnam
                        conflict is, of course, a different matter and distinctly un-helpful.
                        Nevertheless, I feel we must avoid public discussion of these matters as
                        much as possible. We have sent you our standard press guidance in State
                        082955 and I believe we must adhere to that line, particularly at this time,
                        and “no comment” any further detailed questions or speculation on the role
                        of the bases other than to refer to the Bohlen–Serrano Agreement. We are
                        sending a <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss> for your use with
                        Romulo, though I fear it is not much more forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>3. Finally, I am concerned about the nature of the attack you would launch on
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>. It seems to me he would
                        almost have to categorically deny its truth. The consequences of such a
                        public confrontation are hard to foresee but I cannot see how they would
                        serve our interests. In this connection, we also have in mind the
                        consequences that followed from Bill Blair's remarks directed towards
                        Speaker Laurel.</p>
                    <p>4. All in all, I hope you will decide not to use the material.</p>

                    <p>5107. Summary: Ambassador and EmbOff separately have had serious talk with
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> about his current
                        anti-American stance and efforts to publicize and have investigated our
                        usage of military bases in the Philippines. While our previous analysis that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>'s actions are primarily
                        for domestic political reasons still stand, it may be that some of his
                        actions have been based, at least in part, upon a misunderstanding of facts
                        or even miscalculation as to future U.S. policy and posture in the Pacific
                        area.</p>
                    <p>1. Department should probably know that I recently used fairly strong words
                        with Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> at a social
                        affair. As I saw <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> coming
                        through the receiving line for Army Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FRF1"
                            >Froehlke</persName> at Lagdameo's <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537"
                            facs="0586"/>house, I began maneuvering to the opposite side of his
                        group of 120 guests as I had no desire to talk to him. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>, however, came directly to me with
                        a query as to whether I had seen his most recent article. (I still do not
                        know what he was referring to.)</p>
                    <p>2. Making certain that we were not overheard, I told <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> I had seen several of his other
                        articles and letters which concerned me deeply. I said I could only conclude
                        that he had made some basic miscalculations based upon mis-information. I
                        said I thought I detected in some of his moves and words a feeling that we
                        might lose in Vietnam. I told him most emphatically that that was not the
                        case. He said “But what are you going to do?” I finally got his shifty eye
                        and made it very plain that we would do anything we had to do not to lose.
                        He began to appear a bit uneasy and said, “But it is proven that the South
                        Vietnamese will not fight.” I told him there again he is quite wrong, saying
                        that he must be relying too heavily on press reports of sometime ago which
                        were in general quite distorted.</p>
                    <p>3. Being careful to remain courteous and polite, I told him that as a
                        distinguished Filipino citizen he was, of course, fully entitled to his
                        views, and of course to make them public. I said he must remember, however,
                        that we of course are entitled to our own feelings, and that we could hardly
                        help but be concerned that he would mount an apparent attack on the use of
                        our military bases at the very height of the current intensified Vietnam
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>4. We then got more into details and at times it appeared that <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> was honestly surprised by some of
                        the things I told him. For instance, when he referred to GI's loading bombs
                        underneath airplane wings at Clark I told him such reports were undoubtedly
                        true. I said he must know that Clark is utilized for gunnery training by air
                        force pilots both from the Philippines and other areas in the Pacific. The
                        bombs closely resembled real ones but were most often filled with smoke
                        marking material, concrete, etc. I said there had never been any secret
                        about such things, reminding him that <persName>Marcos</persName> and I over
                        a year ago had gone to Clark and handed the trophies to the Philippine air
                        force, who in that gunnery competition had won over our own air force. I
                        told him that he did not have to get conscientious objectors from Clark
                        before a foreign senate body to find out such things. I asked why he did not
                        ask Philippine pilots whose F–5–E's are standing right next to ours on the
                        alert ramp at Clark. I had assumed he would know this, as Clark is in his
                        area, but he seemed flabbergasted. The conversation was broken at this point
                        as we were seated at different tables for dinner. PolOff Ron Palmer was at
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>'s table and he reported
                        that <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> told him that he was
                        quite shaken up over his conversation with me, remarking that I had told him
                        many things which he did not know and seemed contrary to what he had heard.
                        The conversation was quite extensive, with Palmer answering his questions
                        frankly and openly.</p>
                    <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0587"/>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> told Palmer that his
                        experience at the Fuji Seminar on Japan's role in world affairs in the
                        1970's in late March had had quite an effect upon him. He said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat Khoman</persName> and several other
                        important people from the general area were there. He said it seemed to be
                        the majority feeling of the delegates that the U.S. was in fact headed
                        towards a “pull out” from the Asia area. He had thereupon begun to think
                        what the Philippines should do to get prepared for this type of situation.
                        Palmer reminded him that that conference was before President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had shown the whole world, by a
                        series of bold moves, that the U.S. was not going to lose in Vietnam.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> admitted that this was
                        the case, but said that when he read the President's conditions for getting
                        out of Vietnam (i.e., cease fire and return of prisoners only), he had taken
                        it as a clear signal that we were going to bug out. Palmer replied that if
                        he were more up-to-date on our massive actions re Vietnam, he probably would
                        feel differently about it.</p>
                    <p>6. The evening ended with <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>
                        asking Palmer if he would be willing to meet and talk about things some
                        more. Palmer replied at the time that he had enjoyed the conversation and
                        would like to talk again. I told Palmer the next morning he was free to do
                        so. Now I find that <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> that same
                        morning called long-time American resident, Dave Sternberg, saying (falsely)
                        that apparently doors in the Embassy were closed to him and asking to see
                        Sternberg.</p>
                    <p>7. There is no doubt in the minds of either Palmer or me that <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> took our conversation seriously.
                        While our assessment of <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>'s
                        motives previously reported remains unchanged, I am inclined to think that
                        maybe he has not been as well informed as we generally assumed. The pace of
                        his daily activities is so great that he may not have spent the time on
                        “facts” that we would have assumed.</p>
                    <p>8. In all of this, however, I find his remarks about the seminar in Japan
                        most interesting. I have not been so concerned of late about the deleterious
                        effect of the “American withdrawal” bugaboo that has concerned me so much in
                        the past. In looking back I guess I had assumed that our present actions in
                        Vietnam, beginning with the mine laying, had laid this one to rest for the
                        time being. I do not, of course, assume for one minute that <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> was necessarily telling the truth,
                        while tacitly acknowledging his own ignorance, but on the other hand it
                        would probably be unwise to be too sure that he was not. We will be watching
                        for his next public utterances with interest.</p>

                    <p>The President has directed that a review of U.S. policies toward the Republic
                        of the Philippines be made. The study should identify basic U.S. interests
                        in the Philippines. It should examine the implications of the present
                        situation in the Philippines for basic U.S. interests, and the consequent
                        U.S. objectives in furthering those interests over the next five years.
                        Lastly, it should delineate and examine the policy options open to the U.S.
                        over this period.</p>
                    <p>The study should analyze factors and trends affecting U.S. interests and
                        include consideration of:</p>
                    <p>—The political ambitions and intentions of President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> and opposition groups.</p>
                    <p>—The growth of Philippine nationalism, its manifestations in the
                        Constitutional Convention, and its likely effects on U.S. military base
                        agreements, investment and trade.</p>
                    <p>—The political role of the Philippine Armed Forces.</p>
                    <p>—Philippine perception of and reaction to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                    <p>—The economic situation in the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>The study should include consideration of the following policy issues and
                        their interrelationship as they affect U.S. interests and objectives:</p>
                    <p>—Continued access to U.S. military bases in the Philippines. (In this
                        connection, what should be the relationship to continued base access of (a)
                        U.S. military assistance, and (b) the continuation of the preferential
                        provisions of the Laurel–Langley Agreement?)</p>
                    <p>—Continued liberal access to the Philippine market for U.S. traders and
                        investors, and reasonable protection for existing U.S. private investment in
                        the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>—Particularly in relation to the foregoing two issues, (a) to what extent
                        should we preserve our “special relationship” to the Philippines; and (b)
                        should the U.S. take a position as regards the Constitutional Convention and
                        the development of a new Constitution?</p>
                    <p>—U.S. role as regards:</p>
                    <p>—Philippine efforts to maintain internal stability and a satisfactory level
                        of economic development. (As regards internal stability, what should be the
                        U.S. role vis-à-vis Philippine internal security policy and operations? As
                        regards economic development, what should be the U.S. role vis-à-vis
                        external aid and economic development, what should be the scale and
                        direction of our aid programs, and what should be the areas reserved for
                        multilateral programs?)</p>
                    <p>—Philippine efforts to play a constructive regional role in Asia.</p>
                    <p>—As it relates in particular to the foregoing issues, how far should we go in
                        limiting our identification with the present administration and its
                        policies?</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Summary: I saw Pres. <persName>Marcos</persName> July 5 to inquire about
                        significance of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> foreign policy
                        developments of past month for future <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Phil
                        relations. <persName>Marcos</persName> said no fundamental shifts have taken
                        place, but acknowledged things have gotten out of hand and need cooling off.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> accordingly suggests putting off final stage
                        of negotiations on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Phil security and
                        economic matters until early 1973.</p>
                    <p>2. I told <persName>Marcos</persName> during call July 5 that I was beginning
                        to get questions from Washington regarding the foreign policy of the
                        Philippines that I could not answer and hence felt it necessary to seek his
                        own views. I told him that in the past three or four weeks it would be
                        apparent to any observer that the Philippines is in the process of rather
                        drastically changing their policies. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he
                        would welcome my questions.</p>
                    <p>3. I said that in looking back to the period immediately following our
                        meeting recorded on television (reftel) on the subject of our military
                        bases, this subject had become highly publicized and somewhat emotional.
                        Furthermore, the start of the campaign had seemed to be officially inspired.
                        I reminded him that the very next day there were many items in the press
                        quoting “official sources” or “sources close to Malacanang.” I reminded him
                        also that the <hi rend="italic">Daily Express</hi> (his own paper) had
                        headlines the next morning “<gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>–U.S. Bases
                        Must Go!” since that time there had been much pro and con debate about the
                        Philippines leaving <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, etc. I paused
                        for his reaction and he asked that I continue.</p>
                    <p>4. I said these things concerned us primarily because the things that seemed
                        to be under debate were very fundamental indeed, as they all dealt in one
                        way or the other with the military strength of the United States and its
                        deployment overseas. I said that I thought when Romulo talked about the new
                        “realities” in world affairs, that he left out many very important things. I
                        said one reality, as an example, was that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in an election year was asking for a
                        considerably expanded defense budget. I said that our administration was
                        determined that U.S. <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0591"/>strength would
                        not fall below that of the Soviet Union, although we would, of course, do
                        this in ways that would not violate our new <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> agreements, providing they were also lived up to by the
                        Soviets. We hoped that further agreements could be reached with the Soviet
                        Union, but this probably would be unattainable if we dealt from a position
                        of weakness. It is in this context, I said, that we could hardly fail to be
                        concerned at talk from one of our friends and allies of changes that might
                        well significantly affect our force posture, which we consider not only
                        important for ourselves, but for our friends and allies as well.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he wanted me to know that there had been
                        no such fundamental shift in his own thinking. He agreed, however, that
                        things had gone a bit far and thought it was time that he moved to “take
                        some steam” out of these issues. He said he was sure that I knew the
                        Filipinos well enough to realize, however, that negotiations are usually
                        approached with outlandish first positions. I said I realized this, and was
                        sure that some of his advisers would urge such a stance to make the price go
                        up. <persName>Marcos</persName> quickly interjected that he didn't subscribe
                        to that tactic(!). I said the trouble with such an approach was that by the
                        time a sensible compromise had been reached, it could produce a situation
                        where the new agreement would be criticized as being no good because the
                        Philippines did not gain their maximum position. He said he realized such
                        dangers and would exert such control as he could.</p>
                    <p>6. I told him I had been wondering also about timing and tactics. I said I
                        had been concerned of late that he might publicly nominate high-powered
                        panels, including members of the Senate and the House, which I did not see
                        how we could match in our current election process. He said he realized
                        that. Suddenly he said, “I think this whole thing is getting out of hand.
                        Why don't we just delay everything until early next year.” He said he had
                        thought about trying to bring things to a head with a state visit before our
                        elections, but he realized it was geting too late for that, and besides his
                        government was not prepared on its part for such rapid action. I told him
                        that there were some matters on our side that I doubted we could get in
                        shape as well before November. There seemed to be agreement between us that
                        a good time to bring things to a head would be somewhere around February or
                        March. To delay much longer than that would be getting too close to
                        elections here. He said maybe panels should be appointed in December. I told
                        him that this seemed a good idea because there was a great deal of work
                        involved and it might take two or four months to get everything in
                        shape.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName>Marcos</persName> then asked about our “new” disclosure that we
                        were just going to let Laurel–Langley die without being willing to talk
                        about it. I told him that that revelation, sometimes labeled as a leak on
                        our side, had appeared in so much of the press the same day that I can only
                        conclude that it had been inspired by someone, as there had been <pb n="543"
                            xml:id="pg_543" facs="0592"/>no recent decisions or release of
                        information on that subject from our side. It was apparent in his remarks
                        that he would be considerably disturbed if the United States position were
                        that we would refuse to talk about any follow-on to Laurel–Langley.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName>Marcos</persName> asked if he had dispelled some of my concerns.
                        I replied that he had. He said, “Well, then let me go all the way.” He said
                        to tell the truth he hadn't been thinking at all about such things as
                        military bases, alliances, etc. He said that he was so deeply involved in so
                        many internal matters that he had perhaps relied too much on others were
                        distorting on the Philippine image (he explicitly named Romulo as being in
                        favor of removal of our bases). He then went on to list at least 20 things
                        he was working on and began to show some signs of frustration that he
                        couldn't seem to get things done. (We have noticed ourselves a slackening in
                        Malacanang efficiency and morale.) He listed the oil price problem here
                        affecting our companies as one of the problems, and I took a fairly strong
                        line as this problem is, in fact, becoming intolerable to our oil companies.
                        He threw up his hands at one point saying that the Philippines had loans,
                        but was largely without well worked out projects to take advantage of them.
                        He began to show a somewhat agitated state of mind over the magnitude of the
                        problems facing him personally. He did not mention, except once indirectly,
                        domestic political problems.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">Telegram 5074 from

                            necessary as I thought it would clearly at this time tear the nation

                    <p>9. Our talk, which is much longer that can be put in a message, would seem to
                        indicate that we are not about to be hit with some new demand that would
                        surprise us. (There will be a follow-up message, however, recommending that
                        with the short time we have to December or, even to March, we not relax with
                        this new development, but keep our own preparations going.) While this is a
                        welcome development, on the other hand, it is disconcerting to see
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> personally so perplexed about his

                    <p>1. In order to deal with the obvious complexities of the developing situation
                        in Philippines which we have been analyzing in our recent series of
                            cables,<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">In addition to telegram 8424 from
                            Manila, these included telegram 164964 to Manila, September 9; telegram
                            8619 from Manila, September 13 (both ibid.); and telegram 8652 from
                            Manila, September 13. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59,
                            Central Files 1970–73, FN 9 PHIL–<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>) The
                            main issue of these telegrams was <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                            maneuvering to continue in power and to gain the support of the United
                            States for such a development. The telegrams also dealt with economic
                            issues, especially the ownership of property in the Philippines by
                            Americans, including America-owned oil industry property and rights.
                                <persName>Marcos</persName> intimated that U.S. economic concerns
                            would be best met by U.S. support of his political moves. U.S. concern
                            over the property rights of Americans in the Philippines was occasioned
                            by a court case called the Quasha decision which, according to telegram
                            164964, “would appear not only to deprive U.S. citizens of their right
                            to continue after 1974 to own land which they have acquired in good
                            faith under Philippine law, but would also appear to put into doubt the
                            current validity of their titles to such land, including the ability to
                            convey good title to a would-be purchaser.” During the first week in
                            September, however, the <persName>Marcos</persName>-dominated Supreme
                            Court overturned the Quasha decision, a move which <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> theorized in telegram 8424 may
                            have been one of <persName>Marcos</persName>' “first big moves to get
                            our blessing, or at the minimum our acquiescence, to his extension in
                            power.”</note> I should like to try to dissect the problem into more
                        digestible proportions. We might first of all separate things into two
                        categories: (1) The extension of <persName>Marcos</persName> in power by
                        political means which are permissible under the Constitution, and (2)
                        Extension in power by such means as martial law. There was no hint of the
                        latter in his talk with <persName>Johnson</persName>, although he did list
                        it as a possibility, in event the situation so warranted, with Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_IDK1">Inouye</persName>.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d256fn4">According to telegram 8424, Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_IDK1">Inouye</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_BHA3"
                                >Byroade</persName> an oral report of his “considerable time alone
                            with <persName>Marcos</persName>.” <persName corresp="#p_IDK1"
                                >Inouye</persName> said that <persName>Marcos</persName> had given
                            him a long statement as to why it would be good for the Philippines if
                            he remained in power. No other record of <persName corresp="#p_IDK1"
                                >Inouye</persName>'s meeting with <persName>Marcos</persName> was
                            found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Barring unforeseen circumstances, I believe that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> can extend himself by constitutional means
                        without our support, which, of course, he would not ask for unless he needed
                        it. I believe he has the capability, for instance, of getting the
                        Constitutional Convention to approve the concept of a transitional
                        government with him as head for two years in preparation for a shift of
                        parliamentary rule in 1975. He could do this by securing support from all
                        those in the present Legislature who would be automatically extended, and
                        bringing the Constitutional <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0594"
                        />Convention (ConCon) body into the transition government to satisfy the
                        appetities of its members there who are eager to run for public office. He
                        could also bring drafting of the Constitution to an early enought
                        conclusion, I think, so that (if approved by plebiscite) the parliamentary
                        system would go into effect with national elections set for November
                        1973.</p>
                    <p>3. Having the ability to accomplish some combination of the above, I think
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> will not ask for our help. He would only be
                        interested in whether we would oppose him or try to thwart his plans. This
                        may seem rather far fetched to non-students of the Philippines. But
                        notwithstanding proponents of low profile, the position of the President of
                        the United States and his representative here is still absolutely unique
                        here as compared to other countries. A majority of Filipinos would even at
                        this point in time list my position (not me) as the second most important
                        position in the Philippines. A minority, although sizeable, would still list
                        it as the most important. With these considerations in mind, and
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> knows them well, our attitude on any given
                        question is still a very important factor.</p>
                    <p>4. If <persName>Marcos</persName> wants to extend by constitutional means,
                        and we intervene, (which I think we would not at this point, all things
                        considered) we might be in a position to buy considerable benefit to
                        ourselves by simply letting him know that we would not oppose in any way his
                        continuation in power by constitutional means. These matters, we could say,
                        are internal to the Philippines on which we would naturally take no position
                        or action. However, we would want to make clear at the same time the
                        importance we attach to the constitutional legality of these means. All of
                        this, of course, would be quite private, and <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        would want it that way.</p>
                    <p>5. At the same time we should have no hesitation at all to ask him to take
                        specific steps in the interest of our mutual business relationships, which
                        after all are basically good for the Philippines. Nor do I think it outside
                        the realm of possibility that we might get a good share of them. Montelibano
                        (principal spokesman for the sugar industry), for instance, and I think with
                        the President's blessing or at least knowledge, is openly advocating an
                        extension period of 10 to 15 years for the transition of American interests
                        (Laurel is saying this very privately). I believe that this goes byeond his
                        own interests in the sugar quota. I think Montelibano is convinced along
                        with many others that any quick transition will end up in drastic
                        deterioration of the Philippine economy.</p>
                    <p>6. I am in favor of the proposition of getting what we want now, while
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> is legitimately in power, in the nature of
                        constitutional provisions and laws which could be expected to extend beyond
                        his tenure. In my first two years here <persName>Marcos</persName> played
                        quite above board <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0595"/>with me, but this
                        situation had deteriorated somewhat due to his doubts that we can go along
                        with his extension in power. My own attitude is that, if
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> can keep his fingers crossed behind his back
                        while making agreements with us, so can we—and we can also judge the future
                        and our position completely in our own interests as time passes.</p>
                    <p>7. If we are going to go down this route with <persName>Marcos</persName>, we
                        will want to broaden our support here as much as possible at the same time,
                        and not narrow it down to him personally. There are many in and out of
                        government who are vitally interested in the issues of trade preferences,
                        sugar quotas, etc. I would say we should go ahead with the above, we should
                        find some way of getting trade preferences for the Philippines, we should
                        find some way of assuring them on sugar, and we should go ahead with the new
                        approach I have recommended in the security field on military assistance.
                        Incidentally, our recommendations in the latter field do not in any way
                        greatly enhance a military capability that can be used against the Filipino
                        people.</p>
                    <p>8. The second category mentioned above leads us into the question of
                        extension of power by extra-constitutional means. It should be pointed out
                        at the outset that a declaration of martial law, if carried out for the
                        purposes specified in the Constitution, is not in itself, of course, an
                        extra-constitutional step. It could become so if its purpose is extension in
                        power, which obviously is outside the spirit of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>9. I asked <persName>Marcos</persName> yesterday if he were about to surprise
                        us with a declaration of martial law. He said no, not under present
                        circumstances. He said he would not hesitate at all in doing so if the
                        terrorists stepped up their activities further, and to a new stage. He said
                        that if a part of Manila were burned, a top official of his Government, or
                        foreign ambassador, assassinated or kidnapped, then he would act very
                        promptly. He said that he questioned Communist capability to move things to
                        such a stage just now and asked my views. I said I thought it a bit
                        premature in their plans, but the present atmosphere undoubtedly increased
                        their recruiting capability. He said 3,000 students were no longer in
                        greater Manila universities (implying they have allied themselves with the
                        dissidents—a figure we cannot sustain), and that if it were inevitable he
                        would just as soon see them go for big things now in order to get this
                        period of indecision over with!</p>
                    <p>10. <persName>Marcos</persName> could be encouraged in this course by a
                        growing popular concern over the deteriorating law and order situation,
                        particularly on the part of the influential Philippine business leaders, as
                        well as government technocrats. The latter have felt for some months now
                        that a firmer hand at the tiller is necessary to control this situation and
                        the spreading corruption, as well as to remove political and legal obstacles
                            <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0596"/>to greater social reform. A
                        rather surprising number of people seem to be in the mood of letting
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> go ahead and take over with the hope he can
                        straighten things out. This does not mean any great shift of popularity,
                        although his position is somewhat better as reported elsewhere than say
                        three months ago. Rather it is more a philosophical resignation to “who else
                        is there?” There is without doubt a growing feeling that social reform under
                        the present system just may not be possible. A legislature that represents
                        the “status quo” will never agree to meaningful reforms. Also, nearly every
                        action, even including clearance of obstacles from drainage canals which
                        helped cause greater damage in the recent floods, can be stopped by hundreds
                        of court injunctions. Among the articulate there is a growing feeling that
                        revolution, “from the bottom” is inevitable unless “revolution from the top”
                        is prompt and effective.</p>
                    <p>11. Romulo, in an amazing toast to the Korean Foreign Minister recently
                        compared progress in Korea with that in the Philippines in a very
                        unfavorable light for the latter. He concluded that under the present system
                        of “complete democracy” the Philippines would never be able to keep pace
                        with their Asian neighbors. On that same occasion he put his hand on my
                        shoulder and said that “your brand of democracy clearly cannot get the
                        Philippines out of its dilemmas and start her on the road to real progress.”
                        He said that our system was for developed countries and developing countries
                        could not afford this luxury. Later on I told him that in my opinion our
                        brand of democracy really worked best while we were still in the process of
                        development. He said that his people were different and the Filipino would
                        never get out of their deterioration without a very strong hand to take them
                        out.</p>
                    <p>12. Imposition of martial law, or an abandonment of the democratic
                        constitution, would present us in America with a problem. Thailand, for
                        instance, can change its governmental system with hardly a ripple felt in
                        the United States. I do not believe this would be the case with regard to
                        the Philippines, where we introduced our own brand of democracy.</p>
                    <p>13. This message brings you up to date both on reporting and analysis as we
                        see things from here. We are working now trying to formulate as specifically
                        as we can what seems to be reasonable positive action that might possibly be
                        handled by the Supreme Court, the Legislature, and the ConCon. When we get
                        this to you, you may have an easier task in providing Washington comments
                        than has been the case with our reporting so far.</p>

                    <p>In a private conversation on September 12 with the Political Counselor and
                        another Embassy political officer Liberal Party (<gloss target="#t_LP1"
                            >LP</gloss>) Senator <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Benigno S. Aquino,
                            Jr.</persName> stated that he believed President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would declare martial law in order to stay
                        in power. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> is faced with serious economic problems as a
                        result of the floods and the Quasha decision, which <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> thinks will have a severe dampening
                        effect on foreign investment. With rapidly worsening law and order and
                        Communist dissident problems added to these economic woes, <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> believes that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> must take strong actions in the near future
                        and that these will include martial law. If the President follows this
                        course, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said that, “for the
                        good of the country,” he will support <persName>Marcos</persName>. However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> pointed out, martial law
                        could backfire on the President, and <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> expressed doubts that the <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> has sufficient resources to carry out martial law
                        successfully. As for his own political ambitions, <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> believes that the possibilities of
                        his becoming head of government by legitimate means are quickly diminishing,
                        and he is accordingly keeping open an option to lead an
                            anti-<persName>Marcos</persName> revolution in alliance with the

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> stated that he has no doubt
                        that President <persName>Marcos</persName> intends to remain in power. He
                        was less certain of how the President would do this. Presidential elections
                        in 1973 seemed to <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> to be low
                        on the scale of priority for <persName>Marcos</persName>; however, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MI1">Imelda</persName>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName> would almost certainly win if she ran since the
                        President could fill the ballot boxes with fake votes and employ other
                        illegitimate means of insuring her success. As <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1"
                            >Aquino</persName> believes that the Liberals would be powerless to
                        prevent this from happening and could do little more than protest, Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> showed very little
                        interest in his own ambitions for the Liberal Party nomination next year. A
                        second <persName>Marcos</persName> alternative is to stay in office for two
                        more years through the adoption of the synchronization of elections in 1975
                        proposal that pro-<persName>Marcos</persName> delegates are presently
                        floating around Con-Con. But <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>
                        is unsure of <persName>Marcos</persName>' ability to completely control
                        Con-Con. He said that <persName>Marcos</persName> had spent ten million
                        pesos so far in his successful effort to control the Con-Con, but,
                        nevertheless, must be very disappointed with the relatively narrow margin in
                        his favor in the recent vote defeating a draft provision to ban him and his
                        spouse from holding the positions of President or Prime Minister (see Manila
                        8452).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> believes that martial law is
                        the most likely means <persName>Marcos</persName> will use in order to stay
                        in power. <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> said that he would
                        support <persName>Marcos</persName> if this is the course he adopts. Since
                        the law and order and economic situation is deteriorating so rapidly, in
                            <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName>'s view, the good of the
                        country requires strong measures on the part of the Central Government. The
                        growing threat from the dissidents, the worsening law and order problem, the
                        serious economic setback that has resulted from the floods in central Luzon
                        and the probable ill effects of the Quasha decision of the Supreme Court on
                        the country's foreign investment climate were cited by <persName
                            corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> as reasons why stronger central
                        government action is needed. Such action means martial law. Were he
                        President, <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> indicated that he
                        would not hesitate to take such strong action and would, for example,
                        execute several corrupt officials at the Luneta Park in Manila as a lesson
                        to other officials that he meant business.</p>

                            declassified</hi>] reports began to be quite specific about the imminent
                        imposition of martial law. On top of this Bob Wales of Mobile gave me in
                        written form his memo of conversation with <persName>Marcos</persName> the
                        day before which generally paralleled matters that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had told <persName>Johnson</persName> of
                        Caltex previously reported. We are classifying these two documents and will
                        send them by pouch. For purposes of brevity, I will not herein summarize the
                        memorandum of Wales, except to report its last sentence which is as follows:
                            “<persName>Marcos</persName> ended up the discussion by saying that it
                        would be a tragedy if he had to declare martial law if he was not supported
                        by his ally, the United States”.</p>
                    <p>2. I decided I had no alternative but to undertake quickly the potentially
                        dangerous task of a real heart to heart with <persName>Marcos</persName> on
                        issues as delicate as his own plans and ambitions. Last night proved
                        impossible but I had a very long session with him this morning.</p>
                    <p>3. I told <persName>Marcos</persName> that to save time he should assume that
                        I knew in detail the important matters he had discussed with
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> and Wales, except possibly for company
                        matters which were not my concern. I said I did not believe he should place
                        any blame on these two individuals, as they were conscientious Americans who
                        realized that they were getting into matters of proper concern to me and to
                        their government. He said he understood this very well (I think it obvious
                        all along that he assumed they would talk to me).</p>
                    <p>4. I told <persName>Marcos</persName> that I was not seeing him for the
                        purpose of preparing a report for Washington. I said I had a message asking
                        me if I thought martial law was about to be declared, and whether we thought
                        it necessary. I said I did not come even specifically to talk abut that, but
                        on matters perhaps even more fundamental.</p>
                    <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0600"/>
                    <p>5. I said I was not under instructions and anything I might say would at this
                        point be just personal from me. My motive was to try to achieve better
                        understanding so that neither one of us might make a major miscalculation. I
                        said that if I did so, nothing more would happen other than I would get
                        fired and go look for a new job, and history would in no way be changed. On
                        the other hand, if he, as head of state, were to make a miscalculation based
                        upon some failure of mine to communicate, this could turn out to be of real
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>6. He asked what I had in mind. I replied, a great many things, but I
                        supposed we might just as well start with the question of martial law. He
                        said he thought maybe we had better not discuss it directly, because he had
                        to remain in a position where he could say that he had not accepted my
                        advice. I told him that I was not in his presence to advise him on such a
                        decision that only he can make, but I thought we did have to discuss the
                        matter and quite frankly. I told him that he himself had told me that he
                        might have to move if there were some new and significant event. This could
                        mean at any given time that we might be only one day away. Also that one of
                        his last remarks to Wales had brought up the question of our support.
                        Moreover, the question had arisen as to whether New York could not urge more
                        Washington support for him and his government.</p>
                    <p>7. I said I thought it was necessary to reflect a bit on the obvious. We did
                        not have a dictatorship, but a big sprawling bureaucratic working democracy.
                        I said that his brother-in-law's idea of trying to sneak into Washington
                        under an assumed name and making a secret deal or understanding with
                        somebody after midnight went out of vogue about the time of Teddy Roosevelt.
                        I said that efforts on the part of New York, even with our President, could
                        turn out utterly fruitless provided things happened where even our President
                        could not get what he wanted in the way of legislative support, etc.</p>
                    <p>8. I reminded him again that it was terribly important that he understands
                        that it was only I, a friend, talking to him personally and privately. In
                        that context, I said I wanted to talk to him about the type of things that
                        cause me to pace the floor. He said he understood completely and I should go
                        ahead without hesitation. I then reminded him that we are in the wind-up
                        phase of an extremely important election campaign in our own country. I said
                        I thought <persName corresp="#p_MGGS2">McGovern</persName> would seize on
                        anything like a military takeover in the Philippines in an effort to use it
                        as the final proof of his charge that the foreign policies of <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, particularly in the Asian area, were
                        a total failure. I said I thought he would scream that “even the
                        Philippines” had been so badly messed up that the very form of government
                        which we instituted here was now in the hands of military dictatorship,
                        supplied by our equipment. He would probably try to make a major thing of
                        it, proving that this was the beginning of another Vietnam “even in the
                        Philippines.” I said <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0601"/>I know
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> pretty well, and I thought
                        he would be greatly upset if the Philippines gave the appearance of blowing
                        up in his face at a time like this. I returned to the idea that our hands
                        could become so tied up that as a practical fact we couldn't do any of the
                        things we really wanted to do for the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he had made no decision to move towards
                        martial law, and he had never considered anything beyond that, such as
                        military rule. He did admit, however, that planning for martial law was at
                        an advanced state. He said that under any conditions he could foresee he
                        would not consider any extra-constitutional moves in the Philippines. We
                        then got into a discussion as to what type of events had to happen under the
                        Philippine Constitution wherein it would be constitutional to declare
                        martial law. He concluded that words might have a different meaning for us
                        and the Philippine Constitution was perhaps broader in this respect than our
                        own.</p>
                    <p>10. At one point I said maybe we needed his help and the help of his
                        intelligence people, as it was obvious that he and they must know many
                        things in this country that we could not know. I said it was difficult for
                        us to start off with a band of armed men numbering somewhere around a
                        thousand, mostly in the Hills and, with assumed figures as to the extent of
                        their base and mass support, to conclude that the Philippine Government was
                        in danger of being toppled. He said that, of course, was true, and he did
                        not consider the government to be under that threat at the present time, but
                        he said the very effectiveness of government was threatened and that was
                        enough for him to move legally.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName>Marcos</persName> told me at one point that guns were not the
                        answer. He said he did not mean that over the long haul that the Philippines
                        did not need adequate military forces. He then went into quite a brilliant
                        description of the state of things in the Philippines and the absolute
                        necessity for social reform. He said after all of his years in government,
                        including seven in the Presidency, that he did indeed question the ability
                        of the Philippines to achieve adequate reforms in time under the present
                        system. His descriptions of its evils, and graft and corruption, of the
                        impossibility of getting adequate legislation, and adequate resources for
                        desperately needed reforms could hardly have been equalled by any harsh
                        critic of this country. It is hard to escape [garble] that he thinks that
                        his place in history might be made if he had the power of drastic reform. He
                        might even see at this point this is his only route to regain his popularity
                        even to the point where he could win handily in a future election, although
                        he made no reference to either of these thoughts.</p>
                    <p>12. We then went on in an unusually relaxed and friendly session, even for
                        us, to discuss many other things which will be reported separately, and with
                        different classification.</p>
                    <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0602"/>
                    <p>13. As I was about to leave he suddenly changed the subject and said “how
                        long is it to your elections?” I said, “about six weeks.”</p>
                    <p>14. Whether or not I have succeeded in at least postponing new developments
                        here until after our elections, I do not know. I ask White House tolerance
                        in tossing around the name of our President so freely, but it was my
                        judgment that I should pull out all stops on this one.</p>

                        considerable time and study to our own problems. He then talked with great
                        knowledge about the problems created by the recent Supreme Court decisions,
                        etc. He made a number of very interesting statements.</p>
                    <p>2. He said he was not calling Congress back immediately for another much
                        needed session, even though an extremely important bill had not been passed,
                        as he did not want to risk any legislation just now on questions such as
                        parity, or even efforts aimed toward getting legislation which would keep
                        the waters muddy.</p>
                    <p>3. He said he was slowly coming to the conclusion that the Supreme Court
                        itself should correct some of its decisions, and that this might be the best
                        route to try to proceed. He asked what I thought of <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                            >SC</gloss> action which would clear the titles of American-owned land
                        as far as individuals are concerned, but not insofar as the state was
                        concerned.</p>
                    <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0603"/>
                    <p>I said I didn't understand him. He replied that owners of property would be
                        free to make any sale that they wanted to and the govt would then be free,
                        through legislation, to spell out the ground rules for the future. He said
                        this would get the matter back to being the subject of negotiations between
                        two govts, where it belonged in the first place and not in the courts. We
                        could then agree on such matters as a reasonable transition period, etc. I
                        think he has in mind here something like a conveyance to the state or
                        possibly escheat at the end of an agreed transition period, if private sales
                        have not been made by that time. He may need something like this to get the
                        Court or the Congress to go along with a stretched out transition. I said on
                        first thought his suggestion seemed to hold promise. I felt, however, his
                        choice of words wasn't very good as the average person would conclude from
                        the manner in which he had used the word “state” that perhaps confiscation
                        would be the end result. He said he had nothing like that in mind
                        whatsoever. I said that I thought wording was important as under his
                        proposal some time would elapse when people wouldn't know what was going to
                        happen. He said this deserved thought.</p>
                    <p>4. I asked if he would consider separating out the Luzon Stevedoring case and
                        consider quick legislation for its correction. He said this was a bad case,
                        indeed, and had to be corrected without too much delay. He said he thought
                        it best, however, that the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> itself correct
                        it, as the court had made a great error in extending its decision way beyond
                        what the case before it called for. He said he thought the <gloss
                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should reverse itself and allow foreign
                        participation in boards of directors. If that was not corrected the
                        Philippines would never get any foreign investment. I agreed. I asked if he
                        could broaden this to include executive management. After some discussion he
                        said he didn't really know, but it was worth studying as he agreed that in
                        some cases, such as advanced technological enterprises, it would be an asset
                        to have foreign executive management.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName>Marcos</persName> said he thought some parts of the retail trade
                        problem could be handled by legislation. His tentative thought was that the
                        term “retail trade” should be redefined by Congress (perhaps by amending the
                        Retail Trade Act which reserves retail trade to Filipinos but is vague about
                        defining “retail”) and at least make exception for bulk transfers to
                        commercial outlets, which would take care of our oil companies and a number
                        of others who sell (wholesale in our practice) directly to retailers
                        (rubbers, drugs, etc.).</p>
                    <p>6. I told him that we had some thoughts of what might seem reasonable and
                        fair on all these matters and I wondered if he would mind receiving them
                        from me. He said he would welcome that. I asked if there was anyone else in
                        his government that it would be useful for us to have sessions with. He said
                        he thought that he and I had better do <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555"
                            facs="0604"/>it. He said the only two working with him on these matters
                        were the Secretary of Justice and the Solicitor General (a good team). He
                        said things were very delicate, and he even had to work indirectly through
                        friends with the Court.</p>
                    <p>7. I told <persName>Marcos</persName> I remained extremely concerned about
                        draft economic provisions in the steering committee at the ConCon. I said if
                        these provisions were ever calendared we would all be in a real mess, as the
                        parliamentary procedures in that body would mean that all these provisions
                        would have to be changed line-by-line or even word-by–word through lengthy
                        floor debates that would be emotional and could go on for a long time as
                        well as come out in the wrong place.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName>Marcos</persName> then launched into quite an exposé on the
                        ConCon. He said if they could move promptly, which he thought they couldn't,
                        this could be a way they could handle some of the needed reforms in the
                        country. He said it was such an unruly mess, however, that he had just about
                        concluded that they would not finish their job in time for the '73 elections
                        (quite a significant statement). When we finally got back to the provisions
                        that I said worried me, he said he would do what he could to get the various
                        provisions referred back to organic committees and out of the steering
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>9. I said we were all in a box on these issues. On the one hand it was
                        extremely important that our business interests see some sign of movement,
                        and I dreaded the thought of a long period of no apparent motion. I said at
                        least I could let the word get out that we were talking, but there wasn't
                        much I could pass along of our private talks.</p>
                    <p>10. It is encouraging that <persName>Marcos</persName> was this forthcoming
                        on our investment issues. He was obviously prepared, as he asked me
                        September 19 on the phone if I wanted Abad-Santos or Mendoza at our meeting.
                        I said “no” because I wanted to discuss quite delicate matters (reported
                        separately).</p>
                    <p>11. I want to keep working with him on these matters in confidence, and
                        things have now reached the point where, as suggested in Manila 8875, I need
                        to get as many as possible of our needs in front of him. An early answer to
                        this reftel would therefore be greatly appreciated.</p>

                        <item>Philippine President Imposes Martial Law</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName> imposed martial law throughout the
                        Philippines at midnight September 22. He proclaimed it officially at mid-day
                        September 23, according to press reports, saying that it did not involve
                        military rule and that civilian government would continue. We do not yet
                        have the text of the proclamation, and thus do not at this point know its
                        specifics, particularly as to whether <persName>Marcos</persName> suspended
                        the Congress.</p>
                    <p>The situation at present is as follows:</p>
                    <p>—Numerous arrests of <persName>Marcos</persName>' critics have reportedly
                        been made, according to Embassy Manila, including opposition Liberal Party
                        Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_ABSJ1">Aquino</persName> (whom
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> recently accused of conspiring with the
                        Communists), several other opposition politicians, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Manila Times</hi> editor Roces and several other journalists and
                        commentators.</p>
                    <p>—All television stations and most radio stations have been closed, and no
                        major newspapers appeared the morning of September 23. Radio stations are
                        broadcasting no news.</p>
                    <p>—Domestic commercial flights have been cancelled, and Filipinos are allowed
                        to board international flights only upon government permission.</p>
                    <p>—International cable and telephone traffic has been suspended.</p>
                    <p>—No U.S. citizens are known to be involved or endangered.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Marcos</persName>' action followed an assassination attempt the
                        evening of September 23 against his Defense Secretary in which no one was
                        injured and the attackers were not apprehended. This attempt climaxed a
                        two-week rash of urban bombings of government buildings, which have been
                        somewhat unusual in that all occurred at night and very few have been
                        injured. (Embassy Manila reports that public opinion remains about evenly
                        divided as to whether these have been perpetrated by left extremists or
                        staged by the government.)<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">In telegram 9087 from
                            Manila, September 25. (Ibid.)</note> These acts have occurred against a
                        backdrop of a steady growth over the past three <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557"
                            facs="0606"/>years of rural insurgency—and more recently urban
                        terrorism. Our Embassy believes that this increasing violence could render
                        continued effective government difficult or impossible, but could not
                        threaten its existence.</p>
                    <p>President <persName>Marcos</persName>' ambition to hold onto the Presidency
                        after his constitutional limit of two terms runs out at the end of next year
                        is well known. In this context, and as his first-term lustre as a reform
                        president has dulled, he has constantly underlined the deteriorating
                        security situation as posing a need for a strong leader and improved
                        discipline. He is assisted in this by a growing public concern, especially
                        among influential Filipino businessmen and government technocrats, over the
                        declining civil order. Particularly the latter believe that badly-needed
                        reforms are now possible only under strengthened governmental controls.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Likely Filipino Reaction</p>
                    <p>Embassy Manila estimates that the country will react with resigned
                        acceptance, after the initial shock and uproar.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3"
                            >In telegram 9087 from Manila, September 25. (Ibid.)</note> Criticism of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' action would diminish particularly if there
                        is early evidence of movement toward meaningful reform. The Embassy believes
                        that martial law could not be maintained over a long period without either a
                        gradual return to normal constitutional rule or a drift toward more
                        authoritarian forms. We believe that continued tight prohibition of dissent
                        normally vented through the political opposition and media, important safety
                        valves for the volatile Filipinos, would generate potentially dangerous
                        political and social pressures.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for U.S. Interests and Our Position</p>
                    <p>At least in the short term, martial law should pose no direct serious
                        problems for U.S. security and economic relations with the Philippines. In
                        fact, the climate for individual business operations might even be
                        improved.</p>
                    <p>As to our position, I believe we should refrain from comment on
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' action, regarding it as a Philippine
                            matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d260fn4">A notation in <persName

                                key it.</hi>”</note> This stance may well be interpreted as tacit
                        U.S. support for <persName>Marcos</persName>' move, and result in criticism
                        of us, particularly if <persName>Marcos</persName> does not make good use of
                        his increased authority and the situation deteriorates. On the other hand,
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> probably will appreciate such a stance on
                        our part, and this should result in his continued cooperation in our
                        maintaining effective access to our bases in the Philippines and his
                        assistance in resolving U.S. private investment problems resulting from last

                    <p>At their request, a delegation from the Philippine American Chamber of
                        Commerce in New York called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1"
                            >Barger</persName> to express their concern and views with reference to
                        recent events in the Philippines. Mr. Beplat was the primary spokesman for
                        the group.</p>
                    <p>Beplat first sketched briefly the recent events affecting the business
                        climate in Manila. These included the Quasha case, the Lusteveco case, and
                        the threat to declare the oil companies a public utility. He sees all of
                        these actions as essentially political in nature, designed to bring pressure
                        on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to be responsive to President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' requirements. Beplat does not, however,
                        believe that the Philippines desires to drive away American business. To the
                        contrary, he and others have been talking with senior Philippine officials
                        recently, including Executive Secretary Melchor, Secretary of Finance Virata
                        and Governor <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0608"/>of the Central Bank
                        Licaros, who are presently in the US. As a result of these conversations, he
                        believes the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> continues to desire
                        American investment. Chamber members will be meeting with these technocrats
                        in New York next week to discuss current problems. Governor Licaros
                        specifically requested that Beplat invite representatives of 30 banks, with
                        loans to the Philippines totalling $225 million, in order that he might have
                        an opportunity to reassure them as to the future course of the
                        Philippines.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Beplat feels we have problems, arising from President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>' problems which include 1) how to continue
                        in office after 1973, 2) growing levels of communist terrorist activities,
                        and 3) a recalcitrant Congress which frustrates <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                        efforts to obtain reform legislation.</p>
                    <p>Beplat believes that <persName>Marcos</persName> has now made the decision to
                        carry out a program against communist subversion; that this decision will be
                        a major fact of life in the Philippines, regardless of our assessment of the
                        necessity for such a decision; that <persName>Marcos</persName> will be
                        expecting and demanding various forms of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        assistance in carrying out such a program to include additional military
                        assistance, perhaps in the form of helicopters and other aircraft, as well
                        as increased economic assistance to underpin the social reforms which
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> plans to undertake as a part of his overall
                        program to deal with the insurgency. Given the Philippine
                        balance-of-payments problems, Beplat suggests that US aid might be necessary
                        for the success of such reforms.</p>
                    <p>During this meeting, Beplat repeatedly reverted to the theme that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> expects to get additional assistance from
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> because his need is great and because
                        he believes that we are paying much larger sums for base rights to countries
                        such as Spain, Portugal and Ethiopia. Regardless of whether the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> feels it may be supplying adequate assistance
                        to the Philippines at this time, the fact is that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> feels that the Philippines is being treated
                        badly. It is given a separate aid category from base rights countries. It is
                        shortchanged with respect to availabilities of excess defense articles and,
                        generally, the Philippines insurgency is not taken seriously.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> had noted that when he sent his
                        brother-in-law, Governor Ben “Kokoy” <persName corresp="#p_RBK1"
                            >Romualdez</persName>, to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to
                        discuss such matters that Kokoy had returned with the report he had been
                        given a run around; that nobody believes him.</p>
                    <p>Beplat said he presumed discussions were under way in Manila on these
                        subjects. He alluded to the fact that <persName>Marcos</persName> had spoken
                        very frankly and bluntly to some <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> business
                        representatives in Manila. <persName>Marcos</persName> is deadly serious in
                        his intent to stay and play his hand out in the Philippines and the economic
                        aspects of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Philippine relationship will
                        not be settled unless the political aspects are. If
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> goes down or things get rough in the
                        Philippines, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> business will suffer and
                        other <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests will suffer as well. If we
                        want to stay in the <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0609"/>Philippines, we
                        must pay the price and quickly. While <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        understands politics and would not press for a final resolution of these
                        questions before the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> elections, we should
                        be prepared to be forthcoming within a short time thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Beplat closed his presentation by stating that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> business wishes to express its strong concern about the
                        drift of events in the Philippines and to express its belief that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has to take action on these matters;
                        something must be done and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would
                        make a very serious error if it tried to handle these problems in a passive
                        manner. If something is not done soon, the Chamber is going to form a
                        delegation of their senior officials from senior companies and come back to
                        Washington to see President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> asked Mr. Beplat if what he
                        was making was a specific policy recommendation to which Mr. Beplat replied
                        in the negative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> pointed
                        out that an expression of strong concern was one thing but a specific
                        recommendation that we must accede to the demands of President
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would be something else again. In response
                        to this, Mr. Beplat reiterated that he was not making such a policy
                        recommendation; that it was up to the State Department how to best handle
                        this matter, but that something must be done soon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> pointed out that a major
                        concern of ours was that the Philippines not reach a point of no return
                        through acts which might cause <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> companies
                        to bring pressure on the Congress to cut off aid or the Philippine sugar
                        quota or through actions by the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> which
                        would trigger such automatic legal sanctions as those in the Hickenlooper
                        and Gonzales amendments and sugar legislation with respect to expropriatory
                        situations. He felt that this was a message which <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> business might usefully convey to the technocrats. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHH1">Barger</persName> added that it seemed to
                        him that we would not wish to get into a stance where the expectation in the
                        Philippines is that the way to do business with the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> is to squeeze the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        investors in the country to obtain ever new <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> Government concessions. In the long run, such a situation
                        would be in no one's best interest.</p>
                    <p>In closing, there was a brief discussion of why <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        would jeopardize the major interests that the Philippines has in its close
                        economic relationships with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for the
                        sake of gaining necessarily limited marginal increments to <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance. In this connection it was pointed
                        out that the United States already provides very substantial levels of aid,
                        both for regular programs and in response to emergencies such as the
                        flood.</p>
                    <p>In response to the query, Beplat seemed to be saying that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> understood the value of the economic
                        relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, but that he would
                        have to go all out on the difficult course on which he was embarked and
                        that, if he failed, chaos would follow which would be bad for all.</p>

                    <p>1. This man <persName>Marcos</persName> is a chess player, par excellence. It
                        is usually possible to predict that he will choose as his next move one of
                        two or three options that seem open to him—yet we cannot be certain just
                        which one of these the next sealed envelope will contain.</p>
                    <p>2. You should read above reftel which describes <persName>Marcos</persName>'
                        interview with Durdin of <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> that he has
                        decided to settle our investment problems in the Philippines by Presidential
                        decree. We have speculated here in my staff that <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        might in fact make this move. It would tend to prove to the opposition party
                        and all else concerned that he had our backing in his declaration of martial
                        law. Any disclaimer by us, other than out-right public denunciation of him
                        (absolutely out of the question at this time in our own best interests)
                        would be entirely futile. We have almost come full-circle in the scenario
                        discussed with my staff immediately following the Supreme Court decision re
                        Quasha as reported in Manila 8424 of Sept 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Not

                        been deviations along the way, including some alteration of time tables, but
                        the basic theme therein remains.</p>
                    <p>3. While it would be a great relief to see our investment problems solved, or
                        greatly eased, I cannot help but have mixed feelings over the fact that
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> would proceed on these fundamental matters
                        by Presidential decree. If he could have maneuvered the Supreme Court into
                        handling at least two of these problems in our behalf, it would have been
                        much better for us. Had he done so, of course, only a very few of my staff
                        and the readers of these restricted series of messages would have known that
                        he was our benefactor. For the viewpoint of <persName>Marcos</persName>,
                        with his desire for our continued acquiescence to his recent moves, and with
                        the hope that we could move quickly to full support, this probably was not
                        good enough. He would conclude that he should move now, without any other
                        quid pro quo, to obtain this type of support in New York and head off
                        opposition from our Executive Branch and perhaps our Congress.</p>
                    <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0611"/>
                    <p>4. The decrees that he will make will predictably be sensible and good in
                        themselves even for the Filipinos, as they will clear the air of very real
                        recent obstacles to the future of foreign investment, not only our own, in
                        the Philippines. But in doing it in this way, if <persName>Marcos</persName>
                        fails in his efforts over, say, the next year, conditions might be such that
                        any successor government might well reverse with vengeance every decree that
                        he had made. Thus he has made one more very effective move in keeping our
                        fortunes tied together.</p>

                    <p>9362. 1. I am fully aware that this highly restricted channel should not be
                        overdone, and hope things will develop so that perhaps this can be the last
                        in this series for a while.</p>
                    <p>2. This message is to state that, both in my own opinion and that of my
                        entire senior staff, we believe that we should now consider very seriously
                        whether we have any sensible options left other than to accept and—in so
                        doing—to assist as we can the effort by <persName>Marcos</persName> to build
                        a “new society” in the Philippines. Our general reporting had indicated
                        widespread local acceptance of his announced intentions and first firm steps
                        in the direction of achieving reforms, registered in almost all levels of
                        society here. What has been missing so far is any specific indication of the
                        position we felt the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should take in this
                        matter. This is quite proper up to a point, but we are arriving at the stage
                        where it will be desirable, we think, for private indicators to begin to be
                        given. Also more and more—on a daily basis now—we are being faced with
                        decisions that will in one way or another give some clue to our view, or, at
                        least, be interpreted as such. As you will see later on in this message I do
                        not visualize the need for, or recommend, any U.S. public statement of
                        support.</p>
                    <p>3. The Liberal Party is in obvious disarray, with a sizeable grouping
                        apparently ready to give public support to the measures
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> is <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0612"
                        />taking. But lest anyone think we should be too concerned over the plight
                        of the opposition party, let me say the following: with the exception of a
                        very few very solid people, patriots without doubt, the rank and file of the
                        Liberal Party are nothing one could pin any great hopes on for the future of
                        the Philippines. Were they in a position to come into power—the chances of
                        which are now remote (but weren't good anyway)—this would not have
                        represented a real hope of moving the Philippines toward meaningful reform.
                        Dedicated as some very few of its leaders are, they do not seem to have the
                        strength and guts to really control their followers. In general, a Liberal
                        Party victory, which I think very unlikely in the near future anyway, would
                        in time simply have renewed the old process of putting new hands in the
                        till, with disappointment again for real change in the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>4. I conclude now that we should quietly continue business as usual with the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, including
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, watching all the while for any abuse of his
                        new powers. For the short term, at least, I feel almost certain he will not
                        do so. He knows now, in my opinion, that he is literally on a “life or
                        death” course. He also knows that our support for meaningful social reform
                        programs will be critical in the year ahead. There is real question in our
                        minds as to whether the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> can muster the
                        minimum pesos for a sufficient effort without support from our own planned
                        expanded programs. They can, I think, get off to a good start alone, but
                        thereafter much will depend on us. At that time our ability to perform would
                        depend on active program planning now on present programs and prompt
                        consideration of such changes as we may want to recommend.</p>
                    <p>5. For our part, I do not believe we should be impervious to the apparent
                        fact that a majority in this society have spoken out more quickly than we
                        anticipated along the lines of giving <persName>Marcos</persName> a chance
                        for meaningful social reform. Certainly we would not want doubts and
                        hesitations on our part to build up any belief that we do not want the same
                        thing for the Philippines. If reform can happen at least to the degree that
                        would preclude the label “failure” from resulting, it cannot help but be
                        beneficial to our own interests and future relations. And, alternatively, if
                        the current efforts of <persName>Marcos</persName> come to be labeled
                        “failure” there would be the prospect of very serious troubles, indeed, in
                        the Philippines which could affect not only our business interests, but also
                        our security interests as well. It is worth noting in this connection, that
                        at least so far there has been no hint, in the trends that government
                        pronouncements are taking, to blame the past and present ills of the
                        Philippines on the foreigner, which has so often been the case in
                        underdeveloped countries around the world in efforts to move to reform their
                        societies. Our own interest would seem to dictate that we try to keep it
                        this way.</p>
                    <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0613"/>
                    <p>6. As I say, I don't see the desirability of the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> taking any public role in explicit support of
                            <persName>Marcos</persName>, or even of publicly expressing mild hopes
                        that much needed reforms can come to the Philippines. This could be useful
                        to offset some quite unbalanced reporting by temporary press visitors (in
                        contrast to that of the wire services which has been much better informed
                        and balanced) but even so I don't see such a need to commit us. On the other
                        hand, I think we are already in a period where nothing positive in our
                        programs should be held up in a “wait and see” attitude. For instance, if it
                        becomes possible to announce the grand aid reconstruction funds now being
                        discussed with our Congress—then I think we should go right ahead without
                        delay. This of course would be an indirect indicator, but even so it is for
                        a good and popular cause, and there can be no conceivable gain from delay.
                        Monies such as this are not actually spent in the very short term anyway,
                        and we will have opportunities along the way to delay or withhold actual
                        dispersement if things later on seem to be going sour.</p>
                    <p>7. I have had a fear that staff action in Washington on all matters re the
                        Philippines may be suspended due to uncertainty following the declaration of
                        martial law. I hope this is not the case, and at this point we would like
                        the record to show that we want this Mission's recommendations over the last
                        few months to stand, and we hope staff work can continue on them. I know
                        some of these recommendations cause you difficulty, but I want to repeat
                        that as of now they still remain the recommendations of this Mission
                        concerning what we believe is best for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        interests. (We have the tape of <persName>Marcos</persName>'s talk with Till
                        Durdin. He still is planning an across-the-board broad scale talk early next
                        year with us on economic and security matters, as he told me some time
                        ago.)</p>
                    <p>8. In making your assessment of this situation, I suggest you keep in mind
                        that a long drawn out posture of “hesitation” on the part of the United
                        States would indeed be, or at least should be, considered as an important
                        and definite decision on our part. We may very well soon want to adopt the
                        posture, here at least, of pursuing every reasonable avenue that may be
                        available to us in trying to ensure that this situation comes out right.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Philippines Tries One-Man Democracy</p>
                    <p>While there is nearly universal acclaim in the Philippines for the abatement
                        of crime and violence during the first five weeks of martial law, Filipinos
                        are waiting to see whether President <persName>Marcos</persName> really
                        intends to eliminate Communist dissidence and to fundamentally reform
                        Philippine life. <persName>Marcos</persName>' security measures so far
                        appear aimed more at his own political opponents than at Communists, and his
                        “reforms” have been little more than conventional bids for popular support
                        which could have been initiated without martial law. The more radical part
                        of <persName>Marcos</persName>' reform program has so far been largely
                        hortatory, and nothing he has yet done directly threatens the entrenched
                        economic interests of the country's oligarchy. What he clearly is doing is
                        erecting a one-man constitutional regime which permits him to stay in office
                        indefinitely, with almost unlimited powers, under a veneer of parliamentary
                        democracy. <persName>Marcos</persName> wants to have a new constitution
                        completed and approved by the country within about three months, which will
                        enable him to control the government for several years without having to
                        call elections if he finds it inexpedient to do so.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Last year, the Government of Indonesia, with the support of the World Bank
                        and International Monetary Fund, requested $500 million of aid for calendar
                        1969. This request was addressed to the Inter-Governmental Group on
                        Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>), composed of the Bank, the
                        Fund, the United States, Japan, Netherlands, France, Australia, Belgium,
                        Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>At the October 21, 1968 meeting of the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>,
                        the United States pledged to meet one-third of the non-food aid portion
                        ($365 million) of this request, plus an undefined “fair share” of the food
                        aid needs then estimated at $135 million.</p>
                    <p>This memorandum requests your authority to reaffirm that pledge at the April
                        14 <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> meeting and approval of the program
                        to carry it out.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Progress of the Soeharto Government</p>
                    <p>President Soeharto gained effective control of the Government of Indonesia
                        almost two years ago, following the bloody aftermath of the Communist coup
                        attempt of October, 1965. His performance during this period has exceeded
                        what most observers thought possible.</p>
                    <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0617"/>
                    <p>In the economic field, Soeharto and his American-trained advisers have, with
                        the help of foreign aid and the advice of the Bank and Fund, sharply reduced
                        the inflation rate from 635% in 1966 to about 26% for the twelve months
                        ending March 1, 1969. Budgetary stringency and expanded tax collection have
                        led to a balanced 1968 budget. Foreign private investment has been welcomed,
                        although bureaucratic barriers continue to hinder the flow. Free market
                        forces are now the prime determinants of import priorities; government
                        corporations are no longer heavily subsidized; the private trade sector has
                        been revitalized by ending a corrupt system of licenses and controls, and by
                        enabling private enterprise to obtain needed spare parts, new equipment, and
                        raw materials. Exports for 1968 reached the highest level for seven years;
                        they were about 10% above 1967. But stabilization austerity has
                        understandably restricted growth and Indonesia is only beginning the long
                        climb back to pre-1941 levels of productivity.</p>
                    <p>In the political field, the Soeharto Government ended <persName
                            corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s career and confrontation with
                        Malaysia, re-instituted freedom of the press, brought the legislature into
                        the political process for the first time in many years, and suppressed a
                        communist attempt in mid-1968 to establish a guerrilla base in eastern Java.
                        Very serious problems, going to the heart of Indonesia's future, remain: the
                        vitality of political parties is limited and Soeharto has not yet attempted
                        to mobilize effectively the goodwill toward him that exists throughout the
                        country, thus leaving him excessively dependent on the armed forces for
                        political support and administrative action; corruption and smuggling are
                        still widespread and may become a serious political issue; and the nation's
                        archaic administrative apparatus is burdened by an inflated civil
                        service.</p>
                    <p>Despite these and other problems, Soeharto has succeeded in taking many of
                        the politically tough decisions needed to stop economic decline and to move
                        towards stability. The Government is now preparing to give highest priority
                        to economic reconstruction and development. The aid extended by the <gloss
                            target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> has been critical to economic progress
                        thus far, and Soeharto's ability to persist in sensible economic and
                        political reforms depends heavily on continued international support.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Multilateral Approach</p>
                    <p>In 1966 the United States decided that our interests called for a wholly new
                        approach to our aid strategy in Indonesia which would maximize aid from
                        other nations, deeply involve international agencies, and minimize direct
                        U.S. Government involvement in Indonesian initiative and
                        decision-making.</p>
                    <p>The United States took the lead in calling together in 1966 a group of
                        Indonesia's western creditors (the communist states, though invited, refused
                        to participate), to consider Indonesia's unmanageable debt <pb n="569"
                            xml:id="pg_569" facs="0618"/>problem, a $2.2 billion burden inherited
                        from the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> era. The main
                        western creditors reached agreement in 1966, and again in 1967 and 1968, to
                        reschedule current or overdue principal and interest payments on this debt.
                        Communist countries have separately made comparable debt rescheduling
                        arrangements with Indonesia. But, as Indonesia's servicing of “<persName
                            corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>” and new aid indebtedness for
                        the next decade far exceeds its capacity to repay without great harm to its
                        development, western creditors are now sponsoring a study to find a
                        long-term solution to this problem.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>, formed subsequent to the first
                        creditors' meeting, has met about every six months since early 1967 to
                        consider Indonesia's economic performance and its need for foreign
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>The International Monetary Fund has taken the lead in advising the
                        Indonesians on their stabilization program and in evaluating their economic
                        performance for the benefit of aid donors. The Fund has taken the unusual
                        step of establishing a resident mission in Djakarta, including a group
                        providing much needed technical assistance in fiscal affairs. In addition,
                        the Fund entered into a $51 million standby arrangement with Indonesia in
                        1968 and the Fund staff has just demonstrated further support for the
                        Soeharto Government's economic program by recommending a $70 million standby
                        for 1969.</p>
                    <p>The World Bank has also assumed a major and unprecedented role in Indonesia's
                        development. In October, 1968 the Bank opened an office in Djakarta with a
                        ten-man professional staff to assist Indonesia in planning development
                        programs, preparing capital projects, and coordinating foreign assistance.
                        Thus far, the International Development Association has authorized $7
                        million in credits to Indonesia, with $20–$40 million more expected in
                        1969.</p>
                    <p>The Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Program, Harvard
                        Development Advisory Service, and other agencies are also providing skilled
                        personnel and financial resources.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">United States Aid</p>
                    <p>In 1967, the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> countries provided $210
                        million in general stabilization support to Indonesia. Of this, the United
                        States provided about a third, or $65.2 million ($37.5 million in A.I.D.
                        commodity loans and $27.7 million in P.L. 480 rice and cotton). Japan also
                        contributed about a third, with other donors providing the remainder.</p>
                    <p>For 1968, the United States again provided about one-third ($110 million) of
                        a $325 million Indonesian requirement ($25 million of this was an A.I.D.
                        commodity loan and the remainder P.L. 480 rice and cotton). We responded to
                        an unexpected emergency by offering an additional $50 million in P.L. 480
                        wheat products to help prevent a recurrence of the serious food shortages
                        which had caused a quadrupling of <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0619"
                        />the basic rice price at the end of 1967. About $30 million of this has
                        been shipped. Japan agreed to commit $110 million, and about $85 million
                        came from others.</p>
                    <p>In October, 1968, the Fund and Bank endorsed Indonesia's $500 million foreign
                        aid request for calendar 1969 ($365 million for projects and basic imports,
                        including cotton, and $135 million for food). The increase over 1968 is
                        largely accounted for by including total costs of multi-year projects,
                        instead of only actual disbursements as was done in 1968; 1969 disbursements
                        are estimated to be only slightly higher than in 1968.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. had pledged to meet one third (about $123 million) of this non-food
                        aid requirement plus a “fair share” of the food aid requirement. Separating
                        food aid from non-food aid took account of the facts that food aid
                        requirements are highly uncertain from year to year, and that the U.S. is in
                        a special position to respond quickly and flexibly to such needs. While we
                        do not want to define “fair share” precisely, in order to keep some pressure
                        on Indonesia to obtain food from other donors, we must realistically expect
                        to provide the great bulk of wheat and rice needed. This formula also left
                        an amount for non-food aid that represented a practical target for burden
                        sharing.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. pledge was subject to several conditions:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">1. That other donors make commitments satisfactory both as
                            to amounts and terms.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The budgetary cycle of most donor nations usually does not permit pledges to
                        be made before the mid-April <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> meeting
                        and often not before mid-year. The Dutch and several small donors have made
                        known their pledges but a decision from the Japanese is not expected for
                        several months.</p>
                    <p>We propose to offer Indonesia about two-thirds ($81 million) of our non-food
                        aid and $50 million of food aid prior to the April <gloss target="#t_IGGI1"
                            >IGGI</gloss> meeting, leaving a decision as to the balance for later in
                        the year when we know other countries' plans.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">2. Continued satisfactory reports from the Fund and Bank

                    </p>
                    <p>Due to slack demand for more expensive American goods and high freight costs
                        from the U.S., use of A.I.D. loans has been slow in the past. However, with
                        Fund approval, the Indonesian Government recently made special arrangements
                        for A.I.D. loans which have speeded use.</p>

                    <p>This is no longer a problem; Viet-Nam's rice requirements are far lower than

                    <p>The $50 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 A.I.D. loans is
                        already available from current appropriations, as is the P.L. 480. The
                        A.I.D. loans would finance a Stabilization and Food Production Loan of $44
                        million and a $6 million expansion of Indonesia's major cement plant. The
                        remaining $20 million of A.I.D. loans in this calendar year's pledge would
                        come from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '70 loan funds still to be
                        appropriated. The funds provided will finance U.S. exports only and
                        commodities will be selected to minimize impact on our balance of
                        payments.</p>
                    <p>It is now uncertain whether Indonesia will require delivery during 1969 of
                        the full $135 million in food aid (principally rice and wheat) requested in
                        October 1968. Extraordinary rice harvests due to favorable weather, combined
                        with our rice and wheat commitments (including 100,000 metric tons (<gloss
                            target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>) of rice already shipped and charged to our
                        1969 pledge) of last year, produced for the first time in memory a stable
                        rice price during the normal December–March scarcity season. In addition,
                        approximately $20 million of wheat is still available from our $50 million
                        commitment of last year. However, in order to assure price stability during
                        the 1969–1970 scarcity season, the Indonesians will have to line up
                        sufficient rice and wheat imports within the next few months. With this in
                        mind, they have recently requested under P.L. 480, for delivery by early
                        1970, 350,000 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> of rice (about $70 million),
                        and 300,000 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> of wheat flour (about $30
                        million).</p>
                    <p>We would instead propose to offer now only 250,000 <gloss target="#t_MT1"
                            >MT</gloss> of rice ($50 million) in addition to the wheat still

                    <p>In late July 1969 President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made
                        a globe-circling diplomatic trip visiting Guam, the Philippines, Indonesia,
                        Thailand, Vietnam, South Asia, and Romania. The President was accompanied by
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, his
                        Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                            Kissinger</persName>, and a number of other foreign affairs specialists.
                        Guam was the site of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s press
                        backgrounder on July 25 in which he stated that the United States would
                        encourage Asian countries to solve their own internal problems, and at the
                        same time the United States would keep its treaty commitments to them. This
                        policy became known as the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine. After meeting with President <persName>Marcos</persName> in the
                        Philippines on July 26, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had
                        private talks with Indonesian President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> at Merdeka Palace on July 27 and 28. No record of
                        these meetings has been found, but a few briefing documents hint at some of
                        the points <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> discussed. For <persName

                    <p>Talking points prepared for the meetings indicate the policy highlights that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was to stress to <persName

                            >Nixon</persName> underlined what he felt were the key points in the
                        talking points for July 27; the talking points for July 28 indicate the
                        President saw them. On the former, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> underlined “regional cooperative” efforts as being
                        important to political and economic stability in Southeast Asia. He also
                        underscored the idea that, while the United States would provide its share,
                        economic assistance to Indonesia was best “handled on a multi-lateral
                        basis.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also underlined the
                        fact that “Indonesia's special circumstance” deserved sympathetic
                        consideration, but that military “requirements should be weighed carefully
                        with economic ones.” (Both in the National Archives, <persName

                        Messrs. Holdridge and <persName corresp="#p_LWA1">Lake</persName> of his
                        staff.</p>
                    <p>The generals made the following points:</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. should stay in Vietnam long enough to provide Indonesia—and other
                        Southeast Asian nations—with time to strengthen themselves against
                        Communism. The generals were concerned by press reports that the U.S.
                        intends to withdraw by the end of 1970, and showed great relief when Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the U.S. has
                        no intention of withdrawing without regard for the circumstances. The key is
                        a reasonable, tolerable outcome.<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">The President
                            underlined this sentence.</note> The generals stated that the U.S.
                        should concentrate on strengthening the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>;
                        in five years, but no less,<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">The President

                        Vietnam capable of defending itself could emerge.</p>
                    <p>2. The Indonesian military are developing plans for one half a Corps of
                        troops which could be contributed to an international peacekeeping
                        force.</p>
                    <p>3. Although the primary Indonesian emphasis is on economic development, the
                        Indonesian Armed Forces need assistance to build for the future.<note n="4"

                        mentioned was for more training. General Sumitro will give Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> this request in writing on July
                        28. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we would
                        consider this request very sympathetically.<note n="5" xml:id="d270fn5">In a

                        interested in a temporary ceasefire to gain a breathing spell.<note n="6"

                    <p>5. The generals clearly disagreed with Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s statement about the desirability of
                        taking <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> into the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                            >Kissinger</persName> assured them that the U.S. has no secret
                        agreements with Russia.</p>
                    <p>7. The generals suggested that Russian proposals for Asian Collective
                        Security arrangements are designed to stimulate Chinese attacks on Southeast
                        Asia before a pact could be arranged; these attacks would relieve pressures
                        on Siberia and involve the Chinese in confrontation with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted our desire to
                        work with the Indonesians on a basis of equality. We can work with all
                        nations when our interests coincide. We do not seek client states; we prefer
                        healthy independence.</p>
                    <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also stressed the point
                        that we do not intend to “withdraw from Asia” or fail to live up to our
                        commitments. With regard to Indonesia, an attack on so important a nation
                        would clearly threaten the peace of Asia, and we would take it very
                        seriously.</p>
                    <p>The generals asked that the meeting be closely held to the White House, and
                        specifically indicated a desire that the State Department not be informed.
                        They said that if they had further information or views which they wished to
                        convey to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, they would
                        do so through a military attaché (an intelligence man) at the Embassy in

                    <p>3. Following is uncleared running summary of meeting:</p>
                    <p>4. After usual amenities, Secretary noted he was pleased there were no
                        bilateral problems between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Indonesia.
                        At present time, he said, there was a very favorable attitude towards
                        Indonesia in the administration and in Congress and there was less
                        opposition to extending aid to Indonesia than to some other countries. He
                        was particularly grateful therefore for opportunity to learn more about
                        Indonesia and its problems and, if possible, to be better able to understand
                        Indonesia's needs.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said it was indeed
                        gratifying there were no problems between two countries; he hoped the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would, however, not be too surprised in years
                        to come if there might have to be some increases in external aid to meet
                        Indonesia's requirements; such aid, of course, would be in accordance with
                            <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> estimates of Indonesia's real
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he would like to address
                        problems outside of bilateral area and among these were Vietnam; the general
                        effects of British withdrawal east of Suez; China and the Soviet Union; and
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>7. Vietnam: If asked if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> were happy with
                        prospect of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with-drawal from Vietnam,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said this would be an
                        extremely difficult question to answer. In principle Indonesia believes
                        Vietnam problem ultimately must be settled by Vietnamese themselves and thus
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0626"/>would be pleased if <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> were to withdraw its presence. There are
                        practical difficulties, however, with this course of action. If a <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> withdrawal were precipitate there would be
                        great danger of an equally precipitate Communist takeover not only in
                        Vietnam but also in neighboring countries and this would have a direct
                        impact on Indonesia's security interests. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> therefore hoped that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        in considering staging of withdrawal of forces from Vietnam would bear in
                        mind need to maintain general security of Southeast Asia and would see that
                        Saigon Govt, in first instance, as well as other vulnerable govts on
                        periphery of Vietnam, would be effectively strengthened in order to protect
                        themselves from the expected Communist infiltration and subversion.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he would like to see a
                        democratic govt established in South Vietnam. In view of realities of the
                        situation, he assumed that such a GOG would have to include Viet Cong
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>9. British withdrawal: <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that
                        Indonesia has no objection to continuing presence of Australian and New
                        Zealand forces in Malaysia and Singapore. This does not mean, however, that
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would welcome any other foreign
                        forces there to substitute for the British.</p>
                    <p>10. Communist China: <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said
                        Indonesia's view towards China is that despite the low state of relations
                        between <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and Peking (relations are
                        suspended) Communist China as representing the Chinese people should be
                        allowed to enter the community of nations. In this way, said <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, one could at least hope that over
                        time Communist China might become a responsible member of world
                        community.</p>
                    <p>11. Soviet Union: <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said it was
                        obvious that the Soviet Union was increasing its interest in Southeast Asia.
                        The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was intrigued by <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s statement about collective
                        security in South and Southeast Asia but has been unable to gain any
                        clarification of what Brezhnev has in mind. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2"
                            >Gandhi</persName>, who was a recent visitor in Djakarta, also has no
                        idea what <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> means.</p>
                    <p>12. Japan and regional cooperation: The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        is a sincere supporter of regional cooperation, active in <gloss
                            target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_SEAMEC1">SEAMEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is proud that it
                        has been able to achieve some progress in this area. It is hoped that Japan
                        will play a more prominent role in regional affairs as time goes on.
                        Southeast Asian countries, however, fear Japanese economic strength and
                        Indonesia particularly would like a clearer idea of Japan's motives in
                        regional cooperation.</p>
                    <p>13. In addition to these main points <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> said that he would also want to comment on:</p>
                    <p>14. Middle East: The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> believes that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on the Middle East problem
                        are not effective and there appears to be a dangerous confrontation of
                        military forces in that region. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        expressed the hope that the big powers will be able to contain conflict in
                        the Middle East.</p>
                    <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0627"/>
                    <p>15. Five-year Plan: <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that
                        Indonesia's five-year plan is a modest one in the sense that it is based on
                        a realistic appreciation of prospects for development in Indonesia. The
                        country will require about $600 million a year in external aid for this
                        program. The principal objective is to achieve agricultural development and
                        thus lay a solid base for a second five-year plan in which hopefully
                        Indonesia may approach a takeoff stage. In the three years of the new govt,
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has broken the hold of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> on the country and the five-year plan is
                        successfully achieved, this will lessen substantially the capability of the
                            <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> to return to power. The aim in this
                        five year period is to demonstrate to the people that the govt is able to
                        supply their basic needs of food, clothing and other essentials. In the
                        second five-year plan the govt must demonstrate that there will be
                        opportunity for gainful employment for all the people and also govt must
                        launch industrial development. Major objective of second plan will be to
                        develop national capacity to resist subversion and aggression.</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he was happy that there
                        was a sympathetic response to Indonesia's debt problem on part of Western
                        creditors. He wondered what <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> thinks of Dr.
                        Abs' recommendations. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he
                        recognized that Dr. Abs' recommendation for waiving interest payments would
                        probably raise a problem for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Congress. He
                        hoped that this procedural problem would be overcome, however, since a
                        favorable <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attitude toward this issue would
                        certainly influence other countries in favor of Abs' recommendations.</p>
                    <p>17. To revert to economic plan, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        said that Indonesia hopes for considerable help from private sector.
                        Indonesia will need steel production, it will need to develop the Asahan
                        power complex in Sumatra and additional cement and petrochemical facilities
                        in Java. Roughly $200 million will be required for these projects and it is
                        hoped that they can be financed by private investment.</p>
                    <p>18. Secretary Rogers responded as follows:</p>
                    <p>19. On debts, the Secretary said we are sympathetic to Indonesia's debt
                        problem, and we have had discussions with Dr. Abs concerning his
                        recommendations. There are two helpful factors in regard to this issue, (1)
                        Indonesia is generally held in high regard for the caliber of its govt and
                        its policies and (2) the important fact that Indonesia has checked a
                        virtually runaway inflation.</p>
                    <p>20. On private investment the Secretary noted that we are doing all we can to
                        encourage American investors and will continue in this direction.</p>
                    <p>21. On British withdrawal, the Secretary said the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> has no intention of supplanting the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> although we would be concerned if any other super power has
                        such an intention.</p>
                    <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0628"/>
                    <p>22. Commenting on the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        statement on collective security, the Secretary noted that we had been
                        unable to clarify <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> proposal.
                        The Soviet Ambassador in Washington had been unable to enlighten <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the Indian Foreign Minister was similarly
                        unclear as to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s intention.
                        It would be interesting, said the Secretary, if the Soviets were thinking of
                        some kind of security arrangement of non-Communist countries which would be
                        directed against Communist China. He thought this had a ring of
                        unreality.</p>
                    <p>23. Reverting to British withdrawal, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>, said the Secretary, thinks it important that we make
                        clear that we are a Pacific power and we will continue to honor our treaty
                        obligations and to do our part in helping in the economic, educational and
                        cultural development of other countries. We have no intention of withdrawing
                        from Asia. However, we will not get involved with our troops except in
                        connection with treaty obligations. We regard insurgency as a problem for
                        the Asian countries themselves. We will, however, be prepared to help in
                        other ways to strengthen the capabilities of Asian countries to manage their
                        own insurgency problems. Basic to our position is that we will not interfere
                        in the sovereignty of other nations.</p>
                    <p>24. Our interest in regional cooperation derives from the conviction that if
                        the Asian countries themselves fail to appreciate the importance and
                        necessity for such cooperation, they will surely be taken over. We therefore
                        intend to encourage regional cooperation to the best of our ability and we
                        wish to congratulate Indonesia on its successful efforts thus far in
                        strengthening regional arrangements.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PRF3">Pedersen</persName>, Mr. Holdridge, and Mr.
                        Lydman.</p>
                    <p>3. Following is uncleared running summary of meeting:</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> began the session by
                        requesting clarification of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> views on Dr.
                        Abs' recommendations on the debt question.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> noted that as an agent
                        chosen by the creditors, Dr. Abs had been given a mandate to report his
                        views but not to negotiate a debt rescheduling. Abs has advanced the view
                        that while the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> needs relief from its
                        debt problem the purpose of his exercise is to establish a permanent credit
                        position for the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. He is recommending
                        that interest on all categories of debt be cancelled; this would lower the
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> debt from $2.2
                        billion to $1.7 billion. The principal would be amortized over 30 years with
                        payments to begin immediately. Dr. Abs believes there must be one formula
                        for debt rescheduling for all creditors, East Bloc as well as Western. His
                        problem now is how to make his recommendations acceptable. In this regard it
                        is hoped there will be agreement among major creditors such as the Japanese
                        and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with regard to procedures for settling
                        the new debt in order that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can
                        establish a strong position for negotiations with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Abs will be submitting his
                        recommendations the first week in August to the French chairman of the
                        creditors group. Abs will not become a broker in negotiating with the
                        creditors unless he is requested to do so. The <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> has not influenced Dr. Abs in any way but is giving him a
                        free hand to develop his creative thoughts. Our hope is he may become the
                        negotiator with the creditors. It is not certain that he will be able to
                        sell his formula of a settlement with zero percent interest and he may have
                        to modify his proposals in this regard. The <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> intends to talk to the Japanese, however, about the
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> debts in order
                        to give the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> leverage to influence the
                        attitude of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> said that we see some problem ahead
                        in that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid may be used indirectly to
                        service the Communist debts. In facing up to this problem we would attempt
                        to establish the creation of Indonesian creditworthiness as the major point
                        of the whole debt resettlement exercise, recognizing that a fair settlement
                        of the debt problem is vital for the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                        >GOI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> turned to West Irian and
                        reviewed the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s implementation of the act
                        of free choice. He said that the last stage of this procedure would be
                        initiated on August 2. There is no doubt about the result; the West Irian
                        people will of course register their desire to remain in Indonesia.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, however, asked that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> recognize that <pb n="581"
                            xml:id="pg_581" facs="0630"/>the people in West Irian feel somewhat of
                        an historic relationship with the American people due to their experiences
                        in World War II. After the act of free choice the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> will be carrying a major responsibility in West Irian. Only
                        a small part of external aid to Indonesia now goes to West Irian and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wishes to establish a substantial
                        development fund for West Irian after the act of choice is finished. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has dismissed this matter with the
                        Dutch who have been the principal contributors to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> fund in West Irian and the Dutch have agreed that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> should seek additional funds from the
                            <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> and also hopefully from the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        said he would welcome special <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance
                        for West Irian.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that after the act some
                        African countries will be heard from in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> when the West Irian problem comes to their attention. He
                        would appreciate <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> help in explaining the
                        facts of the West Irian situation to these Africans, particularly to the

                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> turned to the question of

                        military relationships, noting that General Sumitro and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had discussed this yesterday. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> does not need material assistance
                        for its armed forces; most of all it requires understanding of the role the
                        armed forces must play. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> hoped that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might
                        lend assistance to the Indonesian armed forces in the training area,
                        including training in the tactical use of modern weapons. So far as
                        equipment was concerned, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said if
                        any surpluses are available the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could
                        certainly use them. He said he would not go into this matter in any greater
                        detail.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> asked that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> seek to enlarge <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> quotas, or markets, for Indonesian primary products such as
                        sugar, rubber, palm oil, etc.</p>
                    <p>10. The Secretary said he would give careful consideration to the matters
                        raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>.</p>
                    <p>11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, referring to the West
                        Irian problem, inquired what actually is expected to happen after the act of
                        choice takes place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said
                        that Ortiz Sanz and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, separately,
                        will report to the Secretary General. The Secreatary General will then
                        report to the General Assembly. His report does not require a <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> vote but comment and debate on the subject
                        cannot be excluded. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said
                        that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wants the least possible debate
                        on this issue because it could become a football for certain Communist
                        countries, such as Albania, to castigate Indonesia; also the problem has
                        racialist overtones in certain African countries, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> fears that the methods used by the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0631"/>in implementing the act of free
                        choice might be exploited by colonialist powers.</p>
                    <p>12. Responding to the Secretary's question on Vietnam, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that while Indonesia would
                        welcome a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> withdrawal from Vietnam, leaving
                        the Vietnamese free to decide their own destiny, at the same time <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> realizes that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> has commitments in the <gloss target="#t_ARDL1">ARDL</gloss>
                        and indeed does not wish the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to pull out
                        quickly. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he cannot make
                        this latter position a matter of public record but it nevertheless
                        represents the view of the govt. If the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        withdraws rapidly, North Vietnam will certainly take over and neighboring
                        countries will be wide open for Communist subversion. The <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would hope for a fair solution from the
                        Paris discussions but also wishes a strengthening of South Vietnam.
                        Realizing that this is not easy in a war-time situation, the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> hopes that the South Vietnamese people will
                        come to accept the regime as their own. The social-political base of govt
                        must be strengthened in South Vietnam and it is necessary that every hamlet
                        have the will to resist. An important element in this resistance, said
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, is to give the people a
                        sense of proprietorship by making it possible for them to own the land. Both
                        the Northern and Southern regimes in Vietnam have slogans that they are
                        giving land to the farmers. This must be credibly implemented in the
                        South.</p>
                    <p>13. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> thought that there were
                        other political forces in South Vietnam that should be included in govt in
                        order to broaden popular support. If South Vietnam can broaden its political
                        base it must then find an ideological base like Pantja Sila. If this can be
                        done then <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces could perhaps safely
                        withdraw. Finally, said <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, there
                        is also the possibility that the Paris Talks will fail, that North Vietnam
                        is not sincere. If so, as he had already told Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        must be prepared to exert greater pressure on North Vietnam. Again, said
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, this position could not be
                        made public but he wished the Secretary to know his feelings.</p>
                    <p>14. The Secretary commented that in effect <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName>'s views represent both the policy of the United States
                        and that of the Government of South Vietnam. The Secretary said that through
                        the process of local elections and other base-broadening activities, such as
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>'s land reform
                        program, which is now before the Assembly for final approval, and through a
                        broadening of cabinet participation—all the major actions that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had underlined are being pursued. The
                        ideological objective is more difficult, said the Secretary, because there
                        has been no base developed for nationalist leadership. The only rallying
                        point at present is anti-Communism. However, if the army and civil defense
                        and civil service could be unified in common purpose in support of the govt
                        this would represent a very substantial base of support for the govt's
                        actions.</p>
                    <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0632"/>
                    <p>15. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> continued on Vietnam,
                        said that he thought it was important that the behavior of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops and South Vietnamese troops be
                        carefully considered in order that they might acquire the image of
                        protectors of the people and comrades-in-arms of Vietnamese forces. He
                        thought it vital for the future of South Vietnam that as <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops pull out, the process should be
                        managed in such a way as to support the image of the South Vietnamese troops
                        that are taking their place and who must remain.</p>
                    <p>16. The Secretary agreed that this was a highly desirable and important
                        objective and noted that we had withdrawn one of our best divisions which
                        had been replaced by one of South Vietnam's best divisions specifically for
                        the purpose of improving the image of the South Vietnamese troops in the
                        eyes of their own people.</p>
                    <p>17. In response to the Secretary's question on China, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said Indonesian-Chinese relations are
                        frozen. He said that obviously China cannot be ignored or isolated
                        indefinitely. He feels China must be brought into the community of nations
                        and that we must face up to this problem in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. On the other hand, said <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cannot
                        sponsor China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in view of the
                        present state of relations between the two countries. There is hope,
                        however, for change in China where Communism has developed in stages. In the
                        first stage, the iron hand was needed to secure sufficient food and clothing
                        for the population. Now China is in the second stage, industrial development
                        is underway and the govt can now force people to work because they have
                        secured sufficient food and clothing for them. This is the meaning of the
                        cultural revolution. At some future time, the Chinese will proceed to the
                        third stage of their development when they will expose their industrial
                        production to the outside world. At that time they will require better
                        relations with outside countries. If China decides to join the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it will be a reflection of its development
                        into its third stage as a Communist country. We may have to wait a long time
                        for this, said <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>. </p>
                    <p>18. Also in judging the Soviet-Chinese conflict, said <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, we must recognize their different
                        stages of development. In their first stage of development, the Soviets
                        tried to include China as well as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Rumania and others
                        in their internal development plan. This created serious difficulties for
                        the Soviets when each of these countries developed to the point where they
                        could no longer be so dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                        >USSR</gloss>. If the Chinese should achieve more economic development, said
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, we can expect their
                        aggressiveness to lessen in the same way that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> became less aggressive as it advanced economically.</p>
                    <p>19. In response to the Secretary's question on Taiwan, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that in a sense the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s attitude toward Taiwan is a procedural
                            <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0633"/>matter. If one asks who is the
                        legimate head of the Chinese Govt, the answer must be Peking, but the
                        existence of the Taiwan Govt cannot be ignored. One might hope that there
                        would be such changes in the Mainland that it would be possible for Taiwan
                        to return to its control. If this is not possible, Taiwan should be
                        reconciled to a status as an island country, not one representing
                        800,000,000 Chinese. Taiwan, representing Taiwan only, should certainly be a
                        member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>20. In responding to the Secretary's question about Cambodia, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName> faced an urgent struggle for survival under
                        extremely difficult conditions. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName> wants to be a saviour and this is only possible in
                        the framework of his Socialist program; this he pursues also to draw support
                        and sympathy from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, China and North
                        Vietnam. A question here is what these countries think of Cambodia. North
                        Vietnam has an historic position of desiring all of the former French
                        Indo-China to be under one system. The efforts of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> and Indonesia should be directed towards trying to keep
                        Cambodia and Laos neutral. This may be decided by the outcome of the Paris
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>21. Turning to the Secretary's question on Malaysia, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he did not think we need worry
                        too much about the situation in Malaysia. The clashes now underway cannot be
                        avoided. The British wished to establish a multiracial society and believed
                        this had been achieved in the 12 years of independence. But when independent
                        Malaysia was created the British left the leadership in the hands of feudal
                        Malays and rich Chinese. Difficulties should really have broken out much
                        earlier and might have been more easily contained but now after one whole
                        generation substantial numbers of Malays and Chinese have been isolated from
                        their leadership—this has created not only a racial problem but a social
                        problem. It is now necessary for the govt to adapt to the real situation.
                        The govt must conciliate the dissident Chinese (in Penang and other areas),
                        and the Malays must face up to the fact that their survival depends on
                        multiracial cooperation. For the Malays it is too easy to see their country
                        as a Malay country and some of them are looking to Indonesia to help them in
                        this regard. Maybe they hope that Sumatra will help them in their struggle
                        against the Chinese, but this is not possible!</p>
                    <p>22. Responding to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s question
                        what could be done now for example, by the National Operations Council
                            (<gloss target="#t_NOC1">NOC</gloss>), <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> said that he had told his friends in <gloss
                            target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_NOC1">NOC</gloss>
                        will be a danger if it is protracted because it excludes Chinese and the
                        longer it continues the more disaffected the Chinese will become. It is
                        logical for the Malays to unite and to seek to strengthen themselves as a
                        community but they must open the dialog with the Chinese and with the poor
                        Malays to bring them into a sense of participation in their country. And
                        they <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0634"/>must deal with the Malay
                        extremists, to convince them that their attitude is destructive to the whole
                        Malay community. The govt in <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss> must seek
                        rapidly to correct the past errors; there must be more and better jobs for
                        the Malays, more and better schools for Malays, and the rural Malays must be
                        given a sense of involvement in their government.</p>
                    <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that the Tunku and Tun
                        Razak are inhibited from dealing constructively with the Chinese because of
                        the influence of extremists in the Malay community. But this is the problem
                        they must solve and perhaps the national unity effort of Ghazali can serve
                        some useful purpose in this regard.</p>
                    <p>24. In response to the Secretary's question on the <gloss target="#t_PRG1"
                            >PRG</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said the

                            >PRG</gloss> representative the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was
                        not in position to recognize them. A representative of the <gloss

                        indirect contacts with the South Vietnamese Govt.</p>

                        responding to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s comment that

                            >Malik</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is
                        getting confused about organizations like <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1"
                            >ASPAC</gloss> and others. He asked what organization the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prefers as a channel for <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance in <gloss target="#t_SEA1"
                            >SEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>26. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> commented that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> regards the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> as kind of a model of a developing country for the reason
                        that its economic prospects, requirements and indeed the supervision, of its
                        economic program have been carefully developed on a multilateral basis
                        including excellent assistance from the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ADB1"
                            >ADB</gloss>. (Discussion was halted at this point.)</p>
                    <p>27. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> joined the meeting at
                        11 am. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> noted that the
                        Presidents had had an excellent discussion. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had accepted his invitation to
                        visit the United States at a time to be worked out by their respective
                        ambassadors. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> thought
                        early January might be a convenient time and he hoped that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> would be able to
                        spend long enough in the United States to travel not only to Washington and
                        New York but also to Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and possibly
                        Houston, to view the Space Center. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> said he was keenly aware of the immense importance of
                        private investment in Indonesia and he was encouraged by the interest that
                        had been shown by American businessmen. In this regard he hoped President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> might be able to
                        arrange a meeting with some of our top business executives in New York.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he thought the
                        five-year plan needed maximum support from private investors.</p>
                    <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0635"/>
                    <p>28. Viewing Asia as a whole, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> said it was quite obvious that the key to at least
                        South and Southeast Asia was Indonesia and certainly if there was a serious
                        reversal in Indonesia it would seriously affect other countries such as the
                        Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. It is thus necessary that Indonesia
                        remain strong and it is the goal of its policy to support this strength.</p>
                    <p>29. It is important, said President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>, that our relationship must not give any appearance of
                        neo-colonialism or exploitation. [garble—We?] must “go together, not one
                        behind the other” whether in the context of multilateral or bilateral
                        relationships, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> respects Indonesian
                        independence and wants to be a part of its era of progress. </p>
                    <p>30. President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed
                        his gratitude for the very good exchange of views that he had had with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> which he believed had
                        established a solid foundation for future <gloss target="#t_US1"
                        >US</gloss>-Indonesian relations. He expressed thanks for President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s invitation to visit the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which he would certainly do at a
                        convenient time.</p>

                    <p>1. I saw <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> prior to leaving
                        for Bali yesterday. I told him it would be some time before the content of
                        his talks with the President on the second occasion would become known to
                            me.<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> had private talks with President <persName

                        know. He looked <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0636"/>at me thoughtfully
                        for a moment and then gave me the following, in summary:</p>
                    <p>2. Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had said that
                        while Indonesia favored a Viet-Nam free of foreign troops it fully realized
                        that the United States should not pull its troops out of Viet-Nam
                        precipitately; also that the United States could not do this in a month or
                        even within a year but over a period of some time, depending on South
                        Viet-Nam's <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>) ability to consolidate its
                        strength. In Indonesia's view this meant finding and inculcating a common
                        ideology and a broadened base for the government so as to increase and
                        strengthen popular support and the national will and capability to
                        resist.</p>
                    <p>Answering President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s question
                        about how Indonesia would be prepared to participate in a peacekeeping force
                        in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> said that Indonesia was prepared to send its troops
                        to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to monitor the implementation of a
                        settlement on condition that (a) it would be part of a <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> sponsored force, (b) its participation would
                        receive the approval of both the U.S. and North Viet-Nam (<gloss
                            target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>), and (c) Indonesia would not have to bear
                        the cost. Although Indonesia would be present as a nonaligned power it would
                        have an anti-Communist orientation and, on the basis of Indonesia's
                        experience, would try to help <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> develop
                        the ability to resist a Communist takeover.</p>
                    <p>3. Threat to Indonesia. The President asked <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> what he saw as the greatest danger to Indonesia,
                        whether it was Communist subversion in the area, a re-emergent Indonesian
                        Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said it was actually none of
                        these things that he feared. The danger lay in possible failure of the
                        five-year development plan. Such failure would provide fertile soil for the
                        comeback of communism in Indonesia by weakening the national will and
                        ability to resist.</p>
                    <p>4. Assistance for Indonesian Development. The President asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> whether Indonesia preferred its
                        economic assistance from the U.S. to be on a bilateral or a multilateral
                        basis. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> replied that it
                        didn't matter to Indonesia. But where projects could provide long-term
                        monuments to U.S.-Indonesian friendship and cooperation, <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> would prefer to see them
                        provided on a bilateral basis. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> stressed the importance of continued foreign
                        assistance for the five-year development plan at a level of $600 million a
                        year. Some relief for Indonesia's indebtedness was also required, possibly
                        along the lines of the Abs Plan.</p>
                    <p>As a sound basis for the second five-year plan certain key projects should be
                        accomplished as soon as possible. These included (a) the Asahan power
                        complex, (b) the steel plant at Tjiligon, (c) the cement plant at Tjibinong,
                        and (d) the fertilizer plant at Tjirebon. The cost of <pb n="588"
                            xml:id="pg_588" facs="0637"/>these projects would be only about $200
                        million. These are the kind of monumental projects that would enhance
                        U.S.-Indonesian relations over the long haul. By implication, <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> hopes the U.S. will find it
                        possible to support these projects.</p>
                    <p>5. Military Assistance. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> whether he felt assured that he had the loyalty and
                        support of the Indonesian armed forces. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> said certain elements earlier had succeeded in
                        infiltrating into and subverting some units of the armed forces, turning
                        them against <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. But
                        cleansing operations had been carried out. Most importantly, <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, as Minister of Defense and
                        Security and Commander in Chief, maintains control over the military,
                        including the police. He plans to keep this control to help ensure against
                        disruption whether from the left or the right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said training in modern
                        weaponry and tactics is also needed. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> repeated the desire to obtain conventional aircraft
                        for close support roles (B–25s, B–26s, <gloss target="#t_A1">A–1</gloss>s,
                        etc.) and for transport aircraft (<gloss target="#t_C1301">C–130</gloss>s).
                        He said these planes are obsolete in the U.S. but still in supply and very
                        useful to Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>6. West Irian. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> told
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that the act of
                        choice would be completed between August 2–4. The follow-up would be all
                        important. It will be a burden for Indonesia to bring the 700,000 West
                        Irianese, the most primitive of the Indonesian people, to an acceptable
                        level of development. In humanistic terms this effort deserved the support
                        of all, particularly the developed countries. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he had not studied the
                        background of the West Irian problem. He would do so when he returned to
                        Washington. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he hoped
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would publicly note
                        that the act of choice had resulted in a decision to stay with Indonesia and
                        pledge U.S. support for the development of these stone age people who had
                        served the U.S. indirectly during World War II. Such public notice by the
                        President would interest other countries in the task of developing West
                        Irian. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> hoped the
                        President's announcement could come as close as possible after August 4 and
                        before the General Assembly meets.</p>

                        felt it would be unwise for the U.S. to strengthen either Red China or the

                        thought Red China should be brought out of its isolation, if possible, and
                        into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He implied that the continuation
                        of the Soviet-Communist Chinese conflict might weaken both and that this
                        would not be unwelcome to him.</p>
                    <p>8. Other Subjects. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        indicated briefly that they had discussed Japan, and the importance of
                        stable prices and markets for Indonesia's agricultural and mining products.
                        Indonesia is making strenuous efforts to increase its oil production and
                        continued access to U.S. markets for Indonesia oil is crucial, <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said.</p>
                    <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0638"/>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he would charge
                        his Ambassador in Washington to get in touch with the Department of State
                        upon his return and work for implementation of the Presidential talks.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> hoped I too would be
                        of assistance and that the talks beginning in Bali on August 5 would also
                        contribute to the implementation of the general principles he and also
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>10. At the conclusion of the review of his talks with the President, I asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> to clarify for me how
                        he saw Indonesia interacting in the future with its neighbors, not only in
                        the economic and cultural fields but in the field of security. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said internal subversion could
                        only be met by the consolidation of the national will and ability to resist,
                        based on the individual nation's own national ideology and economic
                        strength. Indonesia could serve as a model and source of inspiration and
                        provide advice on how it had accomplished this. Indonesia would consult its
                        own interests in the event of any aggression anywhere in the area and he
                        would expect every country to do the same. Any country under a threat which
                        [garble] not feel it could itself meet could ask Indonesia for help and
                        Indonesia would be prepared to respond. Indonesia had already provided
                        military advisors and training assistance to the Government of Malaysia.</p>

                            >Suharto</persName> carefully asserts Indonesia's independent policies,
                        foreign and domestic, as well as its primary responsibility for its own
                        development, but he clearly looks to the U.S. as the primary source of
                        foreign assistance. His reference to “monuments” in the form of U.S.
                        financed projects suggests his desire to gradually induce among the
                        Indonesian people recognition of this primary reliance on the U.S. Clearly
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> would raise the ante
                        on economic aid to include support for $100 million worth of what he regards
                        as key projects, to be begun as soon as possible; also by unspecified
                        amounts of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance in the form of
                        line items for the military excess to U.S. requirements. This may run in the
                        opposite direction from our own desire to avoid challenging public
                        sensitivity here on any suggestion of a developing neo-colonial relationship
                        and our attempts to continue a low posture.</p>

                            Indonesia had made on this issue. On November 6, 1969, the
                            Secretary-General reported to the General Assembly concerning the act of

                            The act of free choice, the Secretary-General said, had been held
                            between July 14 and August 2, when the enlarged West Irian councils,

                        mission which had come at Indonesian invitation to discuss debts. Soviets

                        short term payment 1967–68–69 and $22 million long term repayment beginning
                        1970. Under present circumstances Indonesia could not meet payments.
                        Negotiations almost ended at this point. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> suggested negotiation turn to discussion new
                        Indonesian proposal. This was close to the Abs' terms except had asked
                        Soviets for 35 years repayment and had avoided linking proposal to Abs plan.
                        Soviets said workers country could not be philanthropic and reduce interest
                        to zero. However, it might put off interest payments and accumulate same
                        until Indonesia in position to pay. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> felt door still open for future negotiations.</p>
                    <p>4. His impression was that there is change in Soviet tactics regarding
                        Indonesia and, if debt problem worked out, Soviets will finish aid projects
                        Indonesians wish completed. Soviets might even increase amounts available.

                        Amb. Sujatmoko said this already discussed with <persName corresp="#p_GM3"

                    <p>7. Secretary suggested <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> also

                        Secretary asked to be reminded and suggested either lunch at Dept or visit
                        to Hill. Sujatmoko requested <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1"

                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> asked for Secretary's views on
                        Vietnam and the Middle East. Secretary indicated no great change in
                        situation since their last conversation. He said he saw no willingness yet
                        on the part of the North Vietnamese to enter useful talks. However, he noted
                        change in tactics, quoting President's press conference statement that
                        infiltration rate down by 2/3 and also noting decrease enemy activity. He
                        viewed this as good sign and said if other side wished reinstitute offensive
                        operations it would require build up time. He also noted casualty ratio
                        remains unfavorable North Vietnam. He expressed pleasure over smooth
                        progress redeployment program. He hoped opposition would conclude
                        negotiations would offer best result. He indicated <gloss target="#t_US1"

                        agreeable system supervise free elections, regardless what required. Other

                    <p>9. On ME Secretary said we have hopes of movement but have word problems.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> asked if these on both
                        sides. Secretary suggested possible success Rhodes Formula, but noted
                        difficulties Riad experienced with press when he raised this. He noted
                        Israeli difficulties due October election and said hoped resume four power
                        talks about Oct 20. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> asked if the

                            >Malik</persName> said in his discussion Soviets, <persName

                    <p>I attach (Tab A) Djakarta's 7460,<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">Dated October
                            28, attached but not printed.</note> which describes an approach made by
                        General Sumitro to the Ambassador's Special Assistant for arms aid. Sumitro
                        said that President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had
                        authorized him to approach the Embassy, to explain the situation as they see
                        it, and to request that we study the possibility of equipping the Indonesian
                        armed forces over the next 5–7 years.</p>
                    <p>Sumitro said he recognized that Congressional approval of new major <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs is probably two or three years
                        away. He hopes, however, that a program can be sketched out and that
                        personnel can be trained to use the equipment which they might plan on
                        receiving some years hence. Consequently, he hoped for “some modest
                        increase” in professional training in the current <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> budget, plus transport aircraft and naval spares to meet
                        specific requirements.</p>
                    <p>Sumitro said that the Indonesians have completed their list of requirements.
                        The list does not constitute an immediate request, but they are looking for
                        an indication that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will in the future
                        assist them in replacing Soviet equipment. Sumitro said that this will be a
                        major topic when <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> meets
                        the President next spring.</p>
                    <p>Sumitro said that he planned to raise the same points with Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCAJS1">McCain</persName> during his forthcoming visit.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that General Sumitro some weeks ago passed you a similar
                        request for arms aid through the Indonesian Military Attaché, General Suhud.
                        It would appear that President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> has now decided that he had better begin to hit the

                            to Jakarta, November 21. (Ibid.)</note> the President remarked that he
                        had good memories of his visit to Djakarta last summer, and certainly hoped
                        that our relations were going well. He jokingly said that he hoped, too, the
                        Indonesians were receiving good cooperation from Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>. As he had said when in Indonesia, if
                        one looks at this area of the world Indonesia's 120 million people and great
                        geographic area give it a key relationship in the future of the region.
                        Without Indonesia, there would be no real possibility for regional
                        solutions. Knowing that the Indonesians wish to retain their independence,
                        we in this Administration were looking forward to maintaining a close
                        relationship with them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        stated that he indeed hoped that our relationships could be
                        strengthened.</p>
                    <p>Changing the subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        declared that the Indonesians had read the President's recent speech<note

                                >Nixon</persName>, in his address to the nation on the war in
                            Vietnam on November 3, made the point that the United States would not
                            engage in “an immediate, precipitate withdrawal” from Vietnam, but
                            would, instead, “persist in our search for a just peace through a
                            negotiated settlement, if possible,” or would “withdraw all of our
                            forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program, as the
                            South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom.” (<hi

                        interest and sympathy, and looked on it as a very objective statement of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> situation in <pb n="595"

                            >Malik</persName> added that he thought the speech also indicated the
                        time now was right for political movement in South Vietnam so that the
                        thrust of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy would not only be of a
                        military character. As he looked at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        domestic developments, he had the impression that many people thought the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was pressing solely for a military
                        solution. Political development in South Vietnam might therefore deflect
                        domestic opinion away from controversy in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> to events in Vietnam. Although the position of <persName
                            corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and Ky was not so good, their
                        situation might be strengthened if they were to rely more on the leadership
                        in the countryside. If the relationship between the national leaders and the
                        natural leaders in the countryside could be developed, to the point where
                        the latter were willing to participate in the physical development of the
                        country, the influence of the Viet Cong would be neutralized.</p>
                    <p>The President declared that one of the most encouraging developments in his
                        ten months in office was the strengthening of the Vietnamese territorial
                        forces, as distinct from the regular armed forces. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGCWJ1">Abrams</persName> had said that this was the most
                        significant development which had occurred. The territorial forces had
                        always existed, but before had not possessed much of a will to fight; now
                        they were better equipped, increasingly active, and could provide security
                        to outlying areas which the regular forces could not reach.</p>
                    <p>Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s comments on
                        political development in South Vietnam, the President said that this in fact
                        was our objective, but that the process took time—years and even
                        generations. What we were trying to do was to compress political evolution
                        in the country into a time span of five minutes. Nevertheless, it was
                        important to make the effort, for if there were no local elements assuming
                        responsibility, once the regular military went away, the old problems would
                        appear again. The President likened this type of war to playing a
                        violin—there had to be at least four strings: economic, military, political
                        and social progress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> noted that one of the side
                        effects of the President's speech could be found in his area, namely, the
                        speech would definitely increase the desire of the nations of the area to
                        increase their cooperation regionally. In this respect, the <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> Foreign Ministers were to meet in Kuala
                        Lumpur in December. The President's speech had had a reassuring effect on
                        the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> countries and would encourage
                        them to work out a greater degree of regional cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in this country we had to rule out the easy way of
                        ending our involvement in Vietnam. We could of course get out easily, but
                        this would in turn get us out of Southeast Asia, and therefore we had to
                        find a way to bring the war to an end and yet achieve our limited objective
                        of preventing a government from being imposed <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596"
                            facs="0645"/>on the Vietnamese people from the outside. Noting that this
                        objective had been accomplished in Indonesia, the President hoped that the
                        same outcome would be reached in Vietnam. He thought that he could keep
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> opinion in support of this goal, and
                        certainly would resist efforts to wash out the war as a bad deal, which
                        would bring very bad consequences.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> indicated that, on the other
                        hand, there was a danger that the ending of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> involvement in Vietnam would lead to isolationism. The
                        President agreed, saying that Vietnam must not be interpreted domestically
                        as a failure, especially after the loss of 40,000 lives. If we were to leave
                        under humiliating circumstances or with the war a failure, the American
                        people would say in the event that a threat were directed against Indonesia,
                        Thailand or India, “Why do anything?”</p>
                    <p>Continuing, the President mentioned that one point had been very encouraging
                        to him: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and his colleagues
                        had been able to avoid a Communist takeover in Indonesia. They had displayed
                        courage and leadership and by resisting had showed that the people and
                        leaders of their country possessed the will to retain their independence.
                        Indonesia was the brightest spot: having had the greatest problems, it had
                        now turned completely around.</p>
                    <p>The President touched on the problems in other areas, referring to Thailand
                        and Malaysia, and noting Malaysia's interracial conflict. He commended
                        Singapore under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, observing that Lee
                        understood the problems of Vietnam. The difficulties of all these countries,
                        including Laos and Cambodia, were related and were but a part of the total
                        picture.</p>
                    <p>In response to a statement by the President that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> had been in Indonesia when the change
                        had happened, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> recalled the
                        President's visit to Indonesia as a private citizen, recalling that the
                        President had been the best visitor the Embassy had ever known. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> then spoke of the
                        long-standing friendship which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> had displayed toward the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>, which had existed even during the bad days under <persName
                            corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        understood the real nature of the problems facing his country, and
                        recognized that there were civilian as well as military components.
                        Moreover, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had a view which
                        was not limited to Indonesia, but saw things in terms of the whole area. Too
                        many people, the President said, thought only of their own country. On his
                        trip to Europe, European friends had said to get out of Vietnam in any way.
                        Their reasoning was that because the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was
                        in Vietnam it was not doing enough to support Europe. The same situation was
                        true in the Middle East. The Israelis, for example, assumed that if we were
                        not in Vietnam we would do more for Israel. <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597"
                            facs="0646"/>He had told them that if Vietnam ended as a failure,
                        “forget it”. Americans would simply withdraw from Vietnam, Asia and the
                        Middle East and stay home. He stressed that we were not going to fail;
                        however, we needed to appreciate the fact that there was a domino
                        effect—indeed, just to talk in these terms was to touch on too small a part
                        of the picture. In terms of the effect on the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> and its world relations, if we were unable to succeed in
                        supporting one small country for limited goals, great internal frustrations
                        would result. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had to play a world
                        role, but a proper, not a dominating one. The key was to find a way to end
                        the Vietnam war so that this world role could be played successfully. Most
                        of our friends in Asia understood this. Our efforts were directed not so
                        much at changing North Vietnam, but rather towards trying to find solutions
                        which would enable South Vietnam to stand on its own feet.</p>
                    <p>Turning again to the subject of regional cooperation, the President stated
                        that this was very important and he was encouraged to hear about the meeting
                        in Kuala Lumpur. Regional cooperation was the responsibility of the
                        countries concerned but was also very helpful to our policy here. Too many
                        people here had never visited the region and did not know the great national
                        pride and desire on the part of the peoples of the region to stand on their
                        own feet. Assistance was not wanted if it meant control, and this was a very
                        healthy attitude. However, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could play
                        a good partnership role.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> mentioned on the score of
                        foreign assistance that early after the 1965 coup he had told Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> not to offer aid before
                        Indonesia had settled its own house. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> added he had been told by the Foreign Minister at that
                        time that when the time had come for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid
                        he would let us know.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about Indonesia's present situation—were we doing about
                        what we should be doing? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        replied that he hoped the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would continue
                        and possibly increase its present level of aid, which was crucial in
                        maintaining Indonesia's stability and accomplishing its five-year plan. The
                        President referred to the difficult situation in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>, with the Congress having cut the aid appropriation below
                        what we had asked for. The Foreign Minister should understand that what we
                        were doing now was not a reflection of what we would like to do. However,
                        over a period of five years he anticipated that the situation would be
                        different and Congress would provide more support.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that he was fully aware
                        of these difficulties, but that the Indonesians were still not giving up
                        hope. The President observed in response that we would do as well as we
                        could.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> again brought up the
                        possibility of new isolationism in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>,
                        particularly among the youth. The President said in reply that <pb n="598"
                            xml:id="pg_598" facs="0647"/>the isolationists were not a majority. Some
                        elements in the population said we should not do anything abroad, but most
                        would support a responsible foreign policy. Over 300 members of the House
                        and 59 Senators had joined in resolutions supporting his policy on Vietnam.
                        This was the kind of support which counted. Policy was made in this way, not
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> referred to the Asian
                        Development Bank Special Fund, and wondered about the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> contribution. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> noted we had pointed out that we could not yet go
                        forward with our contributions since we had no special legislation. The
                        President said that he had a long talk with World Bank President <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> prior to the Sato visit and had
                        talked in general on this subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> felt that we need to give more emphasis to the
                        whole Asian problem. He himself could only say that as a result of his own
                        personal intervention we would give this matter more attention. Frankly, we
                        had a problem with Congress, but over a period of five years there would be
                        a change.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> mentioned the question of the
                        Indonesian oil quota in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, to which the
                        President remarked that he was very familiar with this whole issue, and knew
                        that the Indonesian quota was quite modest. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> expressed the hope that the Indonesian quota would be
                        kept open and that Indonesia would have increasing access to the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> market. The President assured him that
                        Indonesia would have a percentage of any increase and would keep this in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the President urged Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                            >Green</persName> to encourage members of the Cabinet and Congressional
                        leaders to visit Indonesia in order to see the country and to get a feel for
                        Indonesia's problems. He told the Foreign Minister that the Indonesians were
                        fortunate to have as Assistant Secretary of State a man such as Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> who was so thoroughly
                        familiar with Indonesia and its conditions. He asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> to transmit his best wishes to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>

                            added, “We don't think that our policy towards these countries [the

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Indonesia's Importance to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Indonesian leadership during the first half of this decade combined
                        hyper-nationalism and Marxist-Leninist revolutionary doctrine in a formula
                        for “nation-building” which in fact sought to destroy Western influence and
                        deny the concept of peaceful change in Southeast Asia. In contrast, the
                        current Indonesian government seeks to obtain economic and social
                        development through the pursuit of pragmatic, non-doctrinaire policies in
                        close cooperation with its neighbors and with multilateral assistance from
                        international agencies and Free World governments.</p>
                    <p>Success for the new Indonesian approach would dramatically improve the
                        economic and security environment in Southeast Asia, of which roughly half
                        the population and area is Indonesian. It could also set a constructive
                        example for other less developed nations. Conversely, an unhealthy Indonesia
                        would pose serious problems for Asia and Australia and endanger U.S. policy
                        objectives in the Pacific.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The Indonesian Setting for U.S. Policy</p>
                    <p>Indonesia has many of the key ingredients for successful development.
                        Separation from mainland conflicts and an ability to handle all foreseeable
                        internal threats permit concentration on economic stabilization and
                        development. Only partially explored but apparently extensive mineral wealth
                        promises future increase in income, and new rice technology may bring
                        self-sufficiency in the nation's basic food crop. Moreover, the performance
                        of the Indonesian government to date has earned the increasing support from
                        international agencies and Free <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0649"
                        />World governments which is essential for the success of that nation's
                        development program.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia's weaknesses, however, match its assets. Two decades of neglect
                        have left Indonesia's basic economic infrastructure in disrepair. Roads,
                        railroads, ports, communications and power will require substantial
                        investments to provide an adequate base for economic development.</p>
                    <p>Problems concerned with human resources loom even larger. A severe shortage
                        of technical skills and managerial expertise limits absorption of economic
                        assistance, and the educational system must be completely reoriented to meet
                        this need. Even more basic impediments to progress are the traditional
                        attitudes and values of Indonesian society, which can deflect foreign
                        efforts to help. These include an emphasis on adaptation to rather than
                        manipulation of the environment, a tendency to avoid rather than solve
                        conflicts and problems, and a paternalistic social organization which places
                        personal relationships above impersonal codes of conduct.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia aspires to a role in Southeast Asia commensurate with its size and
                        population. With this goal in mind, it hopes to see a gradual lessening of
                        the area's dependence on major powers. It has fostered good relations with
                        its immediate neighbors and has attempted to build up the Association of
                        Southeast Asian Nations (<gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>) into the
                        primary vehicle for subregional cooperation. It has scrupulously followed a
                        policy of non-alignment on international issues while pursuing rigidly
                        anti-communist policies at home.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Current U.S. Policy Objectives</p>
                    <p>The absence of immediate security threats or of pressing bilateral issues has
                        permitted United States policy to focus on the long-range goal of assisting
                        in Indonesia's modernization.</p>
                    <p>The United States has sought to strengthen Indonesia's commitment to a
                        pragmatic approach to development. Economic progress attained by such
                        policies will in turn help prevent successful challenges to the regime from
                        internal forces hostile to U.S. interests, promote Indonesian cooperation
                        with the U.S. and other Free World powers, and contribute to the stability
                        and prosperity of the region as a whole. U.S. policy objectives have
                        respected Indonesia's desire to maintain a balance in bilateral
                        relationships which will preserve its non-aligned status.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Current U.S. Posture</p>
                    <p>Past experience cautions against certain dangers attending American
                        participation in Indonesian development: (1) too prominent a role can
                        stimulate a fear common to Indonesia's traditionalist masses that
                        modernization is in fact “Americanization” which threatens Indonesia's
                        cultural identity and political independence; (2) assistance in certain <pb
                            n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0650"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>To avert these dangers the United States has: (1) adopted a multilateral
                        approach in which the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the Inter-Governmental Group on
                        Indonesia assist in determining and meeting Indonesian aid requirements; (2)
                        emphasized economic assistance, limiting military aid to non-combat
                        materials tied to the development program and avoiding direct efforts to
                        promote social or political changes; (3) encouraged private foreign
                        investment; (4) maintained a “low profile”, restricting the number of
                        American personnel in Indonesia to a bare minimum; and (5) quietly
                        encouraged a regional approach to development through <gloss

                            >ECAFE</gloss> and similar organizations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Alternatives in Overall U.S. Approach</p>
                    <p>The options open to the United States in defining its overall approach to
                        Indonesia tend towards two poles:</p>
                    <p>1. Maintaining (or accentuating) the multilateral, “low profile” approach
                        with the short-term goal of keeping Indonesia on a friendly but non-aligned
                        course and with a possible long-term goal of promoting Indonesia as the
                        nucleus for a healthy, independent Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>2. Leading Indonesia into a close bilateral relationship in which the United
                        States would take a much more direct and immediate role in helping meet
                        economic and social problems endangering present Indonesian stability and in
                        helping prepare Indonesia for a greater security role in the region; this
                        relationship would, of course, involve greater obligations on our part.</p>
                    <p>The United States approach can be established at many points between these
                        two poles. Movement towards a close bilateral relationship, however, cannot
                        be easily reversed and can build up a momentum of its own.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Policy Alternatives</p>
                    <p>There is no single issue of such importance that it alone will set the tone
                        for U.S.-Indonesian relations. The United States is instead faced with
                        alternative approaches in several broad sectors which will in combination
                        define our overall posture.</p>
                    <p>The multilateral, “low profile” approach, for example, would be reinforced by
                        decisions to: (1) restrict our Military Assistance Program to civic action,
                        related transportation needs and professional training; (2) adhere strictly
                        to a multilateral formula in which the level of our <pb n="602"
                            xml:id="pg_602" facs="0651"/>economic assistance is not allowed to
                        exceed roughly one-third of that contributed by other nations; and (3)
                        restrict technical assistance to current low levels.</p>
                    <p>Some of the advantages accruing from such decisions are: (1) Indonesia would
                        be encouraged to focus its efforts on economic development; (2) pressure
                        would be kept on other foreign donors to contribute; and (3) the United
                        States would not incur the many risks arising from a conspicuous role and a
                        large American in-country presence.</p>
                    <p>Among the disadvantages of this approach are: (1) failure to meet certain
                        military requests could harm our relations with the Armed Forces, which
                        provide the leadership and the political base of the current regime; (2) the
                        multilateral framework gives less leverage for exacting quid pro quos,
                        including self-help measures, and creates delays and uncertainties in
                        meeting Indonesian needs; and (3) a low ceiling on technical assistance
                        would tend to limit efforts to improve Indonesia's absorptive capacity for
                        foreign assistance.</p>
                    <p>At the other extreme, a close bilateral association would be promoted by
                        decisions to: (1) assist in the modernization of Indonesia's Armed Forces;
                        (2) disregard the multilateral approach and match available American
                        resources to Indonesian needs; and (3) provide technical skills wherever
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Typical advantages deriving from these decisions are: (1) Indonesia might be
                        willing to share the current defense burden on the Southeast Asian mainland;
                        (2) a greater assurance that its foreign assistance needs would be met would
                        strengthen Indonesian confidence in the economic course we advocate; and (3)
                        Indonesia would be directed more towards American markets for eventual
                        military and civil purchases.</p>
                    <p>Disadvantages associated with such decisions include: (1) a significant
                        increase in U.S. expenditures; (2) apprehension on the part of Indonesia's
                        neighbors over its increased military capabilities; (3) the danger that we
                        might replace contributions from other countries or inhibit the growth of
                        Indonesian initiative; and (4) a hostile reaction from Indonesia's powerful
                        traditionalist forces who could accuse the regime of abandoning Indonesia's
                        independent course in foreign affairs and permitting “Americanization” of
                        the Indonesian society.</p>
                    <p>There are, of course, intermediary positions on most of these issues which
                        would provide generally less negative and less positive results than the
                        courses outlined above. Among these are: (1) increasing military assistance
                        in non-combat equipment and training; (2) adjusting U.S. aid levels to meet
                        the gap in Indonesian requirements while adhering to a multilateral
                        framework; and (3) modestly increasing technical assistance.</p>
                    <p>(In the text of this study policy alternatives are discussed by individual
                        problem areas, which have been grouped together in the discussion <pb
                            n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0652"/>above for the purpose of brevity.
                        There are other issues which cannot be grouped with those directly affecting
                        our overall posture towards Indonesia but which will nevertheless require
                        important policy decisions. Among these are: (1) whether to attempt directly
                        to foster political and social progress or to avoid such sensitive and
                        difficult activities; (2) the problem of finding a suitable mix between
                        “program” aid and “project” aid; and (3) finding a means of settling the
                        huge foreign debt inherited from the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName> regime which will ensure a continued flow of
                        resources into Indonesian development and protect the interests of donor

                    <p>The Indonesian economy has achieved stabilization and must now move on to

                        Government has held inflation to 7 percent in 1969 compared with 85 percent
                        in 1968 through a policy of strict budget balancing and liberal foreign
                        assistance in financing food and commodity imports. Both foreign and
                        domestic investment are increasing, with emphasis on the manufacturing
                        sector. Free market forces have been given the major role in economic
                        decisions.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia's greatest problems are its slowness in developing capital projects
                        and in making credits available for needed local investment, <pb n="604"
                            xml:id="pg_604" facs="0653"/>inadequate price incentives for farmers to
                        grow more rice, an inefficient administrative apparatus, and a shortage of
                        private sector entrepreneurs and managers. U.S. assistance has focused on
                        these points. The World Bank is expanding its advisory and project
                        coordinating efforts to help as well.</p>

                        request would actually cover a 15-month period from January 1970 to March

                        “one-third” formula. We have agreed to pledge one-third of total non-food
                        aid with the hope of pressuring Japan to do the same and the other
                        donors—the Europeans and Australians—to supply the remaining third.</p>
                    <p>This year, the agencies propose that the U.S. pledge one-third ($125 million)
                        of bilateral non-food aid ($375 million) and a “fair share” (approximately
                        $105 million) of non-[sic] food aid ($140 million). Including our share of
                        the money which will be provided to Indonesia by the Asian Development Bank
                        and the World Bank, this would be slightly more than we contributed last
                        year.</p>
                    <p>We would pressure Japan to match our $125 million and the Europeans and
                        Australians together to provide the same. This proposal ensures proper
                        burden-sharing and represents a level which is consistent with our budgetary
                        constraints. It risks a small shortfall in meeting Indonesia's request if
                        Japan and other donors prove niggardly, although we could probably make it
                        up late in the year if necessary.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. That you authorize the U.S. to provide $105 million of Indonesia's food

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Additional Point</p>
                    <p>Program loans are extended to Indonesia to finance general commodity imports
                        important to her development effort. The U.S. is not competitive in most of
                        these, however. Indonesia therefore must subsidize imports from the U.S. to
                        use our money. The loans thus cause an inefficient allocation of aid money
                        and a waste of Indonesia's local <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0654"
                        />currency. Budget recommends that we carefully study the possibility of
                        liberalizing the procurement restrictions attached to our program loans to
                            Indonesia.<note n="5" xml:id="d278fn5">A memorandum from <persName

                            particularly as these difficulties relate to our present tying
                            practices.” They were asked for recommendations “on any measures needed
                            to deal with the problem, such as the possibility of partially untying
                            such loans to permit Indonesian procurement from other less developed

                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> was accompanied by <persName

                        Duemling were also present.</p>
                    <p>2. After an exchange of pleasantries, the Vice President expressed interest
                        in Indonesia's economic development plans. He indicated awareness of
                        Indonesia's great resources, its geographic expanse, and asked how long the
                        Foreign Minister thought it would take to achieve their objectives.</p>
                    <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0655"/>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> responded that at least five
                        years would be required just to re-establish the economy which had been
                        ravaged during the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> years.
                        In this time he hoped Indonesia could become self-sufficient in food
                        production. The distribution infrastructure was key because some areas
                        produce a surplus while others are in deficit. Indonesia's problem was to
                        increase its productivity for current consumption at the same time it is
                        investing in infrastructure. Foreign investment is most welcome but it takes
                        time for results since at least two years are required for research and
                        preparation. However, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> hoped that
                        Indonesia would reach the “take-off point” by the end of the first five-year
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>4. Demographic Problems</p>
                    <p>Java presents the greatest problem because of population density and high
                        annual population increase. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        reviewed Indonesia's experience with transmigration. During the colonial
                        period, entire families with all their goods were evacuated, but this
                        technique simply transplanted the same static condition to the new
                        location.</p>
                    <p>5. During the occupation, the Japanese engaged in forced migration. Both
                        techniques yielded poor results. After independence, several schemes were
                        tried leading to general confusion. Attempts to clear virgin jungle suffered
                        from inadequate preparation, with the result that the people's spirits were
                        broken before they became established. Now the government is considering
                        using the armed forces in jungle clearance as part of their civic action
                        program.</p>
                    <p>6. Current thinking on transmigration includes provision of jobs and housing
                        as well as a subsidy until migrants can earn their own livings, though this
                        will be costly. Also, younger people will be encouraged to migrate (rather
                        than entire families) since they are more energetic and carry a new spirit.
                        In addition to jungle clearing, new industries will be created and new
                        foreign enterprises encouraged. The government hopes for a chain reaction
                        relationship between foreign investment and migration.</p>
                    <p>7. The Vice President complimented <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> on the sagacity of Indonesia's planning for migration
                        and its intention to balance agriculture and industry. He hoped foreign
                        investment would ameliorate the Indonesian plans. He thought another
                        stimulating factor could be economic cooperation within the region.
                        Population control remains a problem because most people are happiest in
                        large groups. However, congested areas are time bombs whose potential for
                        disruption and civil disorder offer an easy mark to extremists. Therefore,
                        the problem is political as well as economic. The Vice President concluded
                        by pressing his admiration for Indonesian realism on this matter and his
                        hope that the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> nations could be
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>8. Outcome of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> Meeting</p>
                    <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0656"/>
                    <p>In response to a question from the Vice President about current regional
                        cooperation on security matters, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        reviewed in some detail the results of the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss> meeting held in Malaysia in December 1969. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> suggested that progress so far had
                        only resulted in agreement on the need for cooperation. Prior to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> meeting there had been some
                        apprehension among the membership about one disruptive influence of the
                        Sabah issue, but President <persName>Marcos</persName> had the courage to
                        relax tensions by recognizing that a political approach as well as a
                        juridicial one was possible. Therefore, the Philippines had been willing to
                        put its claim aside for the time being without actually renouncing it.
                            <persName>Marcos</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> that he hopes to visit the Tunku in March or April
                        1970.</p>
                    <p>9. At the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> meeting the five member
                        nations recognized the limitations of their own funds and therefore agreed
                        on a token $1 million contribution from each. Since they have also approved
                        98 projects, it is clear that the available funds are woefully inadequate.
                        However, this symbolic beginning was a good one.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> expects short-term results in
                        tourism and communications and perhaps long-term cooperation in such
                        projects as steel production. On the latter point he said the participants
                        hoped to agree on a site close to the source of raw materials.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> also mentioned several
                        possibilities for bilateral operation (in addition to multi-lateral):
                        between Indonesia and the Philippines on copra production, Indonesia and
                        Malaysia on rubber and tin, etc.</p>
                    <p>12. Progress had also been made in reducing tensions. For example, Malaysia
                        in recent years had been fearful that Indonesia might be dominated by
                        communism, religious extremists or a military regime; <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> thought Indonesia had helped alleviate
                        these fears by bringing Malaysian students over to study in the Indonesian
                        Armed Services Staff College. In the same spirit, Indonesia has not objected
                        to Australia becoming a substitute for the United Kingdom in Malaysian
                        defense matters. Indonesia has also attempted to calm Singapore's
                        apprehensions about the fate of Chinese in Indonesia by easing the
                        citizenship requirements.</p>
                    <p>13. A common fear expressed at the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>
                        meeting, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said, related to the
                        post-Vietnam period. Since the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>
                        charter has no military aspects, the question of defense was discussed
                        informally, outside the regular meetings. In the case of major war or
                        invasion, the countries are planning to send troops to one another; in this
                        respect the others look primarily to Indonesia. This is compatible with
                        Indonesia's forward defense doctrine which favors fighting outside
                        Indonesian territory in the event of a clear threat. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said Indonesia is not planning on this
                        at the present time but it wishes to consider the means of avoiding open
                        attack. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he had stressed the
                        necessity of these <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0657"/>nations
                        demonstrating their unity and strength to help avoid attack. They had
                        achieved understanding on the exchange of information among their top
                        military intelligence officers, though this will take place outside the
                            <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> framework.</p>
                    <p>14. In considering the post-Vietnam situation, the ministers had asked the
                        Vietnamese and Lao observers at the meeting to explain the situation in
                        their countries. The Ministers then held bi-lateral talks with the
                        Vietnamese Foreign Minister since each country has slightly different
                        relations with and policies toward Vietnam. Indonesia, for example, agreed
                        with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister to exchange information on subversion.
                        Vietnam wanted to insist on the establishment of diplomatic relations with
                        Indonesia. But, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said, Indonesia
                        is “in different position from Thailand and the Philippines.” So for the
                        time being, this will not be possible. However, they have agreed to operate
                        a chamber of commerce in each others' capitals. In response to questions
                        from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SCA2"
                            >Sani</persName> said that the chamber of commerce mechanism was chosen
                        (rather than a trade office) <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        pointed out, however, that each government would be free to appoint anyone
                        to this position and it could be an official, even a high-ranking
                        diplomat.</p>
                    <p>15. Additions to <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>On the subject of other nations joining <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> provided the
                        following summary. Thailand thought Burma would not join because of the
                        possible reaction from Communist China. Similarly, Ceylon's trade with China
                        is too important to jeopardize. Australia and New Zealand are already
                        associated with two <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> countries
                        through the Commonwealth. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        mentioned that Australia had asked Indonesia for its thoughts about
                        Australian relationship to <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>, as well
                        as about the Indonesian role in in Southeast Asian security. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that Indonesian cooperation with
                        Australia and New Zealand is improving and expanding especially through the
                        navy and air force. He said border problems between Australia and Indonesia
                        in New Guinea (Irian) had all been settled.</p>
                    <p>16. The Vice President expressed complete agreement with the <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> emphasis on economic cooperation and
                        the organizations' tentative interest in regional security. He suggested
                        that the current danger is not so much all-out invasion as it is
                        insurrection and infiltration. If people have confidence in their government
                        they will willingly combat insurrection and countries which have a stake in
                        foreign trade will be interested in assisting their neighbors.</p>
                    <p>17. Communist China</p>
                    <p>The Vice President also mentioned steps which the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> is taking to reduce tensions with Communist China. These are
                        small steps and we <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0658"/>do not plan to
                        relax our vigilance, but Communist China already appears to have responded
                        with a desire to resume the Warsaw talks.</p>
                    <p>18. The Vice President then commented about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        policy in Vietnam which was in accordance with the feelings of the American
                        people, though not necessarily with the views of the press. We hope to
                        conclude the Vietnam War as quickly as possible. However, the war is not
                        over and we will face a difficult problem with American public opinion
                        unless the nations of Southeast Asia indicate their concern and support for
                        our position. The Vice President pointed out that immediate disengagement,
                        as some people urge, is not compatible with the security of Vietnam. The
                        American public is somewhat bewildered because, although our government
                        receives private assurances from Southeast Asian nations, some Asian leaders
                        often leave the impression in public that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> is not welcome.</p>
                    <p>19. As for what might be done in these circumstances, the Vice President
                        suggested that small nations could help if they would frankly tell us when
                        we are doing something wrong or abrasive. Similarly, they should be equally
                        frank with the Soviet Union. They could also shore up American public
                        opinion and counter isolationist sentiment by being equally frank when they
                        agree with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy. These approaches might
                        also help diminish tensions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and Communist China.</p>
                    <p>20. The Vice President said that the <persName corresp="#p_NVT3"
                            >Thieu</persName> Government is enjoying continued success. Enemy
                        activities have decreased but major attack is still possible, and its effect
                        would not be military so much as psychological because it would once again
                        arouse anti-war activities in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Whether
                        or not our withdrawal is precipitate depends in part on whether Asian
                        nations are able to impress their concern on American public opinion. The
                        American people will believe one side or the other. At the moment, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s head-on approach has
                        turned public opinion in his favor but this situation would be seriously
                        impaired by a preemptive Communist attack. The Vice President expressed
                        complete agreement with a toast made in Singapore by Prime Minister Lee in
                        which he cited the folly of notifying the Communists about the time and
                        level of our withdrawals. The Vice President understood the delicacy of
                        Indonesia's domestic politics but he hoped Indonesia would find an
                        opportunity to indicate that the Americans are wanted in Asia.</p>
                    <p>21. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> replied that
                        the subject of the American presence now and in the future had often been
                        discussed among the Southeast Asian nations. They do not favor a precipitate
                        withdrawal because they are not yet prepared to assume the defense burden,
                        although they cannot admit this publicly. (<persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> said that even after the Vietnam War is over America
                        should not become isolationist because <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610"
                            facs="0659"/>its assistance will be needed. When he last saw President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in Washington he had
                        expressed this need and also mentioned the need to determine how Southeast
                        Asian nations can help Vietnam.) The Vice President mentioned how impressed
                        he had been while visiting Vietnam with the cooperation between <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Vietnamese troops. If the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> adheres to reasonable levels of withdrawal,
                        we can successfully transfer responsibility to the Vietnamese. He also drew
                        an analogy with our experience in Korea where, today, very few <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops are involved. Korea is also an example
                        of how a country's ability to defend itself depends on economic
                        stability.</p>
                    <p>22. Bilateral Relations</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he would not wish to
                        conclude the meeting without mentioning <gloss target="#t_US1"
                        >US</gloss>-Indonesian relations, which he thought were going well. He
                        particularly commended our understanding of Indonesia's needs, as
                        demonstrated at the recent <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> meeting,
                        and hoped Indonesia would also have our support in convincing other nations
                        that they should help. The Vice President said that our ability to respond
                        depends on our own budgetary situation. We look upon assistance as an
                        investment in world society. However, many Americans think our efforts are
                        not appreciated. The Vice President recognized the problem of incurring
                        reactions from Communist states, but he thought countries like Indonesia
                        should take a calculated risk in this matter. The Vice President thought it
                        was important for nations to make clear which economic system they favored
                        and which promised them the greatest gains.</p>
                    <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that the Indonesian
                        people recognize what the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has done and
                        this recognition will be made clearer in the future.</p>
                    <p>24. The Vice President asked <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> to
                        convey his best wishes to President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>, expressed his regrets at not being able to visit
                        Djakarta but stated that he looks forward to seeing President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> when he visits Washington.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> indicated he would transmit
                        this message.</p>

                            >Minutes of the meeting were not found.</note> it was agreed that the

                        President spelling out in broad terms the equipment which would be supplied
                        under the military aid program for Indonesia, under Options 3 and 4 of
                        Section VI B of <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 61.<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>The consensus in the Review Group was that the program should be somewhat
                        larger than at present and that there should be a judicious addition of
                        combat equipment to the present program, which is limited to civil action
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p>The President believes that his conversations with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> oblige him to proceed with a
                        combat/civil action mix, between Options 3 and 4. For planning purposes a
                        program level of about $15 million should be assumed. (If supplies are
                        available from surplus stocks, they could of course be utilized, reducing
                        somewhat the need for additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        appropriations.)</p>

                        I added that in the meantime appropriate agencies of the U.S. Government
                        were giving further consideration to the question of providing military
                        assistance to Indonesia, and that he should not necessarily take the 10
                            <gloss target="#t_C471">C–47</gloss>s as the end of the story.</p>
                    <p>General Suhud, who had not heard of the provision of the <gloss
                            target="#t_C471">C–47</gloss>s, appeared very pleased. He asked if he
                        might now discuss with Defense the arrangements which had been made for
                        sending the aircraft to Indonesia. Since our Embassy in Djakarta had told
                        the Indonesians there about this matter, I informed General Suhud that I
                        could see no objection to his getting in touch with Defense, but that I
                        would appreciate his not informing Defense that he had heard of the matter
                        from me.</p>
                    <p>General Suhud informed me inter alia that he is returning to Djakarta early
                        next month to assume a new post. He believes that this position will be
                        Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence of the Indonesian Army. His
                        replacement will not be informed as to the contact which he, Suhud, had been
                        maintaining with the White House, and hence any further communications would
                        need to be via the special channel which had been set up last summer in
                        Djakarta.</p>

                    <p>The President has directed the following actions, in response to the
                        memorandum of February 4 from the Secretary of State.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d283fn2">See <ref target="#d280">Document 280</ref>; <persName

                    </p>
                    <p>1. An expanded <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program for Indonesia is
                        approved on an annual basis totaling approximately $15 million per year
                        (including the imputed valuation of items supplied from excess stocks), with
                        the five year projection strictly for planning purposes. No commitments for
                        a five year program should be implied, nor should the program be designed so
                        as to provide more gradual deliveries in the early years with a speed-up
                        toward the close of the period.</p>
                    <p>2. Because of his conversations with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> the President has directed that
                        there should be more combat matériel than is envisaged in the illustrative
                        program enclosed with the memorandum of February 4. There should be informal
                        consultations with the Indonesian Armed Forces as to their combat equipment
                        priorities, in order to determine what combat matériel should be considered
                        for the program.</p>
                    <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0663"/>
                    <p>3. A supplemental <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> appropriation bill
                        should not be required in order to finance the $10 million increase over the
                        original budget for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Indonesia in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971. This increase should be met from
                        deductions from other programs and insofar as possible from maximum use of
                        excess stocks.</p>
                    <p>4. You are authorized to proceed immediately with discussions with the
                        Indonesians.</p>
                    <p>5. The nature of the proposed program should be definitively spelled out
                        prior to President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                        visit in late May.</p>

                    <p>1. Public statements by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>
                        clearly show his awareness of importance of Cambodia to security Southeast
                        Asia, including Indonesia. As reported by <gloss target="#t_FBIS1"
                            >FBIS</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> told press
                        March 25 that “what is happening in Cambodia at present is a change of
                        government and that Indonesia recognizes the government currently in power
                        in that country.” <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> added that all
                        foreign troops should be withdrawn from Cambodia since their presence only
                        “endangers situation in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>2. Request you see <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> at earliest
                        convenient moment to discuss developments in Cambodia as they relate to
                        security of Southeast Asia. After commending him for his above statement,
                        you might point out to him that we too fully support the neutrality and
                        territorial integrity of Cambodia. Communist allegations of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> involvement in Cambodian affairs are
                        absolutely without foundation. These charges are an <pb n="615"
                            xml:id="pg_615" facs="0664"/>obvious effort to divert attention from the
                        undeniable fact that there are perhaps 40,000 North Vietnamese encamped on
                        Cambodian soil plus some 5,000 Viet Cong. It was in order to gain
                        international support, including that of Moscow and Peking, for the removal
                        of these NV/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces that <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> set out on his trip. Meanwhile,
                            <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> is continuing efforts to
                        talk with Hanoi and <gloss target="#t_PRG1">PRG</gloss> to get them to
                        remove these forces and there are now unconfirmed reports and rumors that
                        Communists may be seeking to attack and overthrow Government of Cambodia or
                        to extend control over various parts of country.</p>
                    <note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">In telegram 46727 to Djakarta, March 31, <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> advised <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName> in part that if <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss> countries were “to play [a] useful role with regard to
                        Cambodia, it [is] important that they publicly announce their support for
                        Cambodia's neutrality and territorial integrity at earliest possible moment.
                        I therefore do not believe you should await <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName>'s return April 4 or 5 [from Bonn] but should try to
                        see <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> soonest and encourage
                        Indonesian initiative through him.” (Ibid.)</note>
                    <p>3. Under these circumstances, would be most useful if Asian countries were to
                        register their concern over developments in Cambodia and their support for
                        Cambodian neutrality and territorial integrity, much the way <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> has already done (see para 1). If this
                        could be done by <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> countries speaking
                        with common voice, this would be particularly impressive, but if <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> as an organization shrinks from being
                        involved in this kind of an issue, then it would be second best if <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> member countries could speak up on
                        their own. In any event, it is better for Asians to take the lead than it is
                        for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or European countries. Moreover, any
                        indication that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was putting Asian
                        countries up to making such statement would be unfortunate.</p>
                    <p>4. I leave it to your best judgment and finesse as to how to handle this
                        issue with <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> in a way likely to
                        result in <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> (or failing that, <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> member countries) making their position
                        clear along above lines. It is not our intention to approach other <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> countries on this issue since this
                        should be a purely Asian initiative. Indeed I would hope you could handle
                        conversation in such a way that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        would make suggestion himself about <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>
                        or <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> member countries making statement
                        and that he would follow through with them.</p>

                        April 1, I told him I had a matter of some urgency that I had wanted to
                        discuss with <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> but he was abroad. It was matter
                        which I thought had to be considered at top level.</p>
                    <p>2. I said situation in Cambodia and question of preserving Cambodia's
                        neutrality were most worrisome. I said <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName>'s statement a few days earlier stressing the
                        importance of Cambodia's neutrality had been helpful. I spoke of the
                        importance of underlining and doing all possible to preserve Cambodian
                        neutrality, and of the difficulty for U.S. to do much because we were
                        already accused of having been somehow involved in change of governments in
                        Phnom Penh. I emphasized, of course, this not true and <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> appeared accept this. I asked
                        whether <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had thoughts
                        about what might be done, whether there had been any consultation with
                        Indonesia's neighbors, whether he thought it might help if group of Asian
                        nations such as <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> were to evidence
                        interest and support for Cambodia's neutrality.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said current events in
                        Cambodia were difficult to interpret, because of paucity of information and
                        conflicting reports. It was necessary to study the Cambodian situation
                        carefully in order determine whether support to <persName corresp="#p_LN2"
                            >Lon Nol</persName> was indeed the way to preserve Cambodian neutrality
                        and the best chance for Cambodia's continued independence. He reflected
                        considerable caution that Indonesia not be caught in support, verbally or
                        otherwise, of an unsuccessful Cambodian regime, or in a posture which would
                        both weaken Cambodia and be seen as collusion between <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                        >USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> thought best thing
                        currently to be done was to try to strengthen support among Asian nations
                        for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of threats to Cambodian
                        neutrality and he implied that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was
                        prepared to support such an effort.</p>
                    <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0666"/>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said that if it
                        developed that <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> was able
                        consolidate <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FARK</gloss> and people behind him and
                        he needed outside help, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be
                        prepared try to help him. But, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> said, Indonesia had no physical possibility of
                        helping Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> added that it might be
                        vital to U.S. position in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> that <persName
                            corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> receive help and perhaps <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could serve as channel for U.S. assistance
                        which would, if given directly, otherwise compromise Cambodian neutrality. I
                        said it would be next to impossible in American system to channel our
                        assistance in any way that would not become known and further complicate
                        problem.</p>

                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: As we have noted previously, <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, while appearing to realize
                        importance of maintaining Indonesia's non-aligned position, does not appear
                        always to realize nuances of protecting that position. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and FonDept generally take care of
                        this aspect. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> appeared
                        stimulated by our discussion of this problem but I have feeling he needs
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s guidance. In any case, my
                        discussions on Cambodian problem here last few days reveal that Indonesians
                        are thinking mainly of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> not <gloss

                    <p>1. You may have noted today's Phnom Penh broadcast declaring Cambodia's
                        adherence to neutrality and spirit of Bandung, and informing international
                        community of necessity “to accept all unconditional foreign aid from all

                        assistance to Cambodia on a covert basis? What are the chances of keeping

                    <p>2. Since Cambodian Army (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FARK</gloss>) utilizes
                            <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss> rifles, we would be particularly
                        interested in knowing whether Indonesians might have any <gloss

                        available for Cambodia. (We understand Indonesia manufactures <gloss

                            of possible “Indonesian sources” for <gloss target="#t_AK471"
                                >AK–47</gloss> rifles and ammunition. <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                                >Green</persName> stated that the Indonesians had “a small factory

                            some ammunition, but he did not know “whether the production is in

                            Cambodia, “we would have to replace them with American rifles.” He then
                            asked how long it would take “to get delivery from Indonesia” and how
                            “the rifles would be routed to Cambodia.” <persName corresp="#p_NWE1"

                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> reiterated to me Indonesia's
                        willingness to assist <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>
                        Government with small arms if U.S. willing replenish and said <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> awaiting <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> reaction. <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1"
                            >Sudjatmoko</persName> obviously not in complete agreement with his
                        President's position but dutifully carried out instructions.</p>
                    <p>2. According to <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName>
                        President told him this morning that Cambodia must be helped and that
                        Indonesia should do its best to be of assistance since, because of
                        historical background, Thailand would have difficulty and, to preserve
                        Cambodia's neutrality, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should not become
                        directly involved. Indonesia only logical country available and <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> willing to provide training
                        within Indonesia, and small arms. <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                            Nol</persName> has asked <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        specifically for small arms for two to three divisions. Indonesia might be
                        able to help with small arms for brigade but could not supply quantities
                        required without replenishment by the United States. Arms for Cambodia would
                        not be of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> manufacture and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName> said to <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that Indonesia could handle
                        transport by air, ferry and sea. In response to my query <persName
                            corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName> said that, while
                        President did not specifically say so, he had implied <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> supply of arms to <persName
                            corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> government would be open although
                        replenishment by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be kept
                        confidential.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName> raised with
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> the implications for
                        Indonesian non-alignment if such collusion between <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> and Indonesia became known. He also said he had explained to
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> the cautious hedging
                        of both the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists in their support for
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> and effect on entire
                        Indo-China conflict if Indonesia were to become so openly involved.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> apparently undeterred
                        by <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName> cautions but
                        told <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName> that he had
                        informed <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> to go slowly in shift
                        from monarchy to republic and <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0669"/>that
                        he had urged <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> to try to use
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> or Queen Mother to
                        neutralize their supporters, somewhat in the fashion he had used <persName
                            corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s supporters after 1965
                        coup.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName> intends to
                        discuss this whole matter with <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        either in Djakarta or Bangkok Friday or Saturday. It's our impression that
                        neither <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> nor others in FonDept
                        had, before <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> talked to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName>, been cut in on
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s plans to assist
                            <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. In light of what appears to be specific request from <persName
                            corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>'s willingness to be forthcoming, it appears <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be amenable to move ahead along lines
                        ref A with some assurance <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> approved of such
                        action and would be willing to provide replenishment for arms given to
                            <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss>. However, when <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> returns, he may try to slow down
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SUDJATMOKO1">Sudjatmoko</persName>'s task was to be
                        sure I got message and reported it to you which I assured him was case.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> raised the subject of <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military assistance to Indonesia. The
                        Indonesians had asked us for 40 T–37 jet trainers, and he and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> both felt that this was
                        not advisable. For one thing, the cost of the T–37s would virtually take up
                        the whole aid program, and in addition he doubted that jets would be a good
                        idea. The Australians, for example, were opposed to them. He proposed
                        instead that our aid be confined to transport-type aircraft such as <gloss
                            target="#t_C471">C–47</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_C1301"
                            >C–130</gloss>s which could be converted as gunships and thus might meet
                        the Indonesians' desire for combat equipment. He appreciated the desire of
                        the Indonesian Air Force to get jets and the morale factors involved, but
                        thought that giving the T–37s was going too far.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> responded with the
                        observation that the President would probably ask, if confronted with
                        State's position, why it would not be possible to give the Indonesians at
                        least some of what they wanted, say perhaps 5 or 10 T–37s. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> agreed that this could be done.</p>

                    <p>1. At informal Sunday luncheon meeting at residence, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>, who as you know is one of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s closest
                        advisers, raised Cambodian issue with me. He indicated awareness of my talk
                        with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and of at least my
                        first talk with Sumuatmoko and he asked whether I'd had any response from
                        Washington on proposition that if Indonesia gave arms assistance U.S. would
                        replenish. After my negative reply <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> urged I try again.</p>
                    <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0671"/>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> said it was Indonesia's
                        assessment that unless Lon Nol Government received arms and other help
                        within next two weeks it might fail. Result of that would be increased
                        Communist threat in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> said Indonesia felt it
                        urgent to get small arms for from five to ten battalions into Cambodia
                        within next two weeks. He indicated Indonesia was prepared to do this (I
                        asked him if Indonesia was thinking of supplying <gloss target="#t_AK471"
                            >AK–47</gloss>s and he indicated vaguely that this was possible) but
                        that unless these arms were replenished Indonesia itself might be facing
                        increased internal threat. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        said Indonesia was prepared to supply small arms, training assistance both
                        within Cambodia and in Indonesia, and close air support. Latter would depend
                        entirely, however, on willingness U.S. to supply T–37s and OV–10s.</p>
                    <p>4. I told <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> that I thought it
                        best that Indonesia work out with Cambodian Government whatever assistance
                        it thought it should and could give without reference to any arrangement
                        with U.S. I said I thought questions of U.S. supply of small arms and
                        aircraft to Indonesia should be quite separate matter. I said otherwise some
                        leak linking two was almost inevitable and would be devastating. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> indicated agreement in principle
                        but said some reassurance from U.S. that replenishment would follow was
                        essential.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> said <persName

                    <p>6. I asked <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> whether Foreign

                        some ideas on trying to shore up Cambodian neutrality on diplomatic front,
                        was aware and approved of Indonsia military assistance to Cambodia.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> answered affirmatively.
                        He said he had discussed it with <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        before latter left for Manila a little over a week ago and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had commented that it was important
                        that whatever was done be done expeditiously.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> said <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> regarded Indonesian efforts to
                        help Cambodia to be implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. Sutopo in turn probable
                        awaiting <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s return and perhaps
                        return Indonesian team from Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>9. Although there is serious doubt in my mind that Indonesians would be very
                        effective in this, their first, exercise in providing military assistance to
                        beleagured neighbors, I tend to think it would be salutary for them to get
                        their feet a little wet in their attempt to give content to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine on Asians taking intitative.
                        I suggest therefore that I be authorized to suggest to <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that they work out whatever
                        they think they can and should do to block expansion of Communist threat in
                        Cambodia and that they will find U.S. sympathetic to problems of replacement
                        and replenishment which, however, must be handled quite separately and
                        unrelated to what they do for Cambodia.</p>

                        is minimal and completely consistent with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine. <persName corresp="#p_MCAJS1"
                            >McCain</persName> tells me that Djakarta has ordered the Soviet
                        technicians out. They have no spare parts for their Soviet equipment and,
                        consequently, may have to come to us eventually for equipment.<note n="2"

                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MCAJS1">McCain</persName> said that his
                            recent visit to Indonesia was “the first CINCPAC visit there and he had
                            received a good reception.” <persName corresp="#p_MCAJS1"

                                “<persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> suggested we continue
                            to drag our feet on responding to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                                >Suharto</persName> on proposal that U.S. replenish Indonesian arms
                            supply to Cambodia. I said I thought it was highly impractical to link
                            U.S. military assistance to Indonesia to Indonesian assistance to
                            Cambodia. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> indicated
                            agreement and said he had made this point to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. I said I was somewhat

                            said I didn't need to worry, he had told <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                                >Suharto</persName> he would be talking to me on Cambodia.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> concluded “there is
                            obvious lack of consensus among various advisers to <persName

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> told me this morning (I met
                        him with dawn patrol on golf course) that he is shooting for conference of
                        12 or 14 Asian nations at either Kuala Lumpur or Djakarta in early May.</p>
                    <p>2. I asked <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> whether he was trying
                        to convene preparatory meeting before main conference in early May. He
                        replied in negative. I asked him which countries would be sponsoring
                        conference. He said Thailand, Japan, New Zealand, and Indonesia. I asked him
                        whether Australia would also sponsor. He said there hadn't been time to get
                        Australian Foreign Minister's approval when he talked to him but that
                        Australian Foreign Minister had announced approval publicly in last day or
                        two.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he had met with North
                        Vietnamese Chargé yesterday and asked latter to convey to his Government
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s ideas about conference and
                        invitation to attend. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said
                        Chargé's response reflected irritation. Chargé called Cambodian Government
                        illegal, said coup had been arranged by American <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> and that American troops were in Cambodia. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> responded that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> information indicated Government of Cambodia legal with
                        approval of legislature. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said
                        perhaps North Vietnamese had information on <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> involvement which Indonesia did not have but Indonesia's
                        information indicated there were no American troops in Cambodia.</p>
                    <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0674"/>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said with obvious relish that
                        North Vietnamese are now on defensive and that “we had seized the
                        initiative.”</p>
                    <p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> that we were most
                        interested in his efforts and were rooting for him.</p>

                        appreciate clarification on the decisions taken to move into Cambodia, and
                        on the resumption of the bombing. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> interjected that we had not resumed the bombing
                        and our activities over North Vietnam had been stopped after we had achieved
                        what we wanted.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from the Ambassador on whether this was a one-shot
                        affair, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that it
                        depended on the other side, but that our intention was not to go on day
                        after day.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the subject of Cambodia, the Ambassador asked whether the
                        conclusion could be drawn that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had
                        given up on establishing buffer states? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> stated that it had not been the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which had moved into Cambodia, established
                        bases, and expelled the Cambodian authorities. We were not going to occupy
                        Cambodia, <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0675"/>but would destroy
                        supplies and then withdraw. We were not going to march on Phnom Penh, and
                        would be delighted if all foreign forces could be withdrawn from Cambodia
                        and Indo-China. Our purpose was to protect our own forces and to protect
                        Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>As to buffer states, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        noted that we had no interest in staying on in that region, and would
                        expect, welcome, and support anything which other states encouraged. We had
                        had nothing to do in instigating the Cambodian situation, and had accepted
                        the situation under <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>. The
                        Communists had then moved out of their bases and had shown that they
                        themselves did not accept a buffer state.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stressed to
                        Ambassador Soedjatmoko that he could assure his President and the highest
                        levels of authority in Indonesia that we wanted buffer states, and that if
                        the Asian nations desire a security system we would be glad to withdraw. We
                        believed that what we were doing was in the interest of the neutral nations
                        in Asia.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador declared that he was relieved to hear what Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had said—he had been starting to
                        be less sure on these points. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> said that the situation reminded him of a joke, in
                        which somebody was hitting a mule over the head with a sledge hammer, and
                        when asked why, had said that he had to do something to get the mule's
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Soedjatmoko recalled that in the President's April 30 speech,<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">In his address to the nation on the situation in
                            Southeast Asia of April 30, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> explained that U.S. and South Vietnamese forces
                            would launch attacks “to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the
                            Cambodian-Vietnam border,” where “North Vietnam in the last 2 weeks has
                            stripped away all pretense of respecting the sovereignty or the
                            neutrality of Cambodia.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                            405–410)</note> there had been a heavy reference to the credibility of
                        the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> expressed the opinion that the issues were closely
                        related, to which the Ambassador remarked that he would have expected a
                        slightly lighter tone if we had been focusing only on Hanoi. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated that it was hard to
                        distinguish. This was the most dangerous situation in the world, and Hanoi
                        knew both publicly and privately that if it moved on Phnom Penh we would do
                        something. It knew, too, that if it stepped up <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> casualties, we would do something. The situation affected
                        not only Hanoi but other countries. We were not looking for a confrontation,
                        though.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Soedjatmoko said that there was some pressure in Indonesia to call
                        off the conference on Cambodia. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> observed that this would be a mistake, to which
                        the Ambassador responded with the reassurance that his Foreign Minister
                        still believed the conference <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0676"
                        />should be held. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        agreed, but emphasized that it should be an Asian initiative and that we
                        would make no public endorsement.<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">In a
                            memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, May 4,
                            Holdridge stressed some of these very points, noting that the United
                            States Government would be “glad to see Indonesians and other Asians
                            taking the lead in trying to do something for Cambodia,” and that a
                            “public U.S. endorsement would harm rather than help the conference.”
                            Holdridge noted also the U.S. hope “that any resolution on withdrawal of
                            foreign forces does not seem to be pointed at us, whose presence is
                            admitted and can be documented, rather than equally at the Vietnamese
                            Communists, whose presence there long antedates ours, but who refuse to
                            admit it.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador Soedjatmoko mentioned that when President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> arrives, it may be at a time
                        when issues were heightened in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was scheduled to have
                        a meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Was there a danger
                        that the visit might become politically utilized or embarrassing? Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought that the visit
                        would not be embarrassing for the Administration, although almost certainly
                        an effort would be made to embarrass <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> and to show that Asians disapprove of our policy.
                        Nevertheless, having seen President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> in action, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> had great confidence in his ability to be
                        enigmatic. Ambassador Soedjatmoko laughingly referred to inscrutable Asians,
                        and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that
                        occidentals could be inscrutable too.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed confidence
                        that the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> visit could be
                        handled tactfully. His estimate, based on what he knew, was that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was not excessively
                        pained by our policy and if he expressed his views carefully would be
                        understood and not embarrassed. We were looking forward to his visit, and
                        would do everything we could for its success.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Soedjatmoko raised a minor point: if the two Presidents met alone,
                        he hoped it would be possible to have the Foreign Minister meet with Under
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> at the same time.
                        (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> would be in Rome.)
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained that a
                        decision would be needed as to whether he would sit in with the President;
                        if not, he would certainly sit in with the Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if there were any
                        special wishes from President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> which the Ambassador wanted to convey. He wanted to
                        reassure the Indonesians that we understood their position. We wanted a
                        neutral Indonesia, and didn't expect a blanket endorsement of our policies.
                        We thought that what we were doing in Cambodia was in their own interest,
                        and undertake not to hurt their neutrality but to protect it. Our operations
                        were limited, as would become apparent <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628"
                            facs="0677"/>when they were completed. Our main purpose was to strike at
                        enemy logistics.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Ambassador Soedjatmoko referred again to the point of a
                        neutral buffer zone and said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>'s remarks had clarified the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> position in this respect.</p>

                        insight into what he will want to discuss with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. I began conversation by congratulating <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> on outcome of Asian conference and way it had been
                        handled. He said he hoped that conference and follow-up, if successful,
                        might serve as pattern which could be used further to deal with situations
                        in Laos and South Vietnam. He indicated that achieving consensus between
                        divergent views of South Koreans and South Vietnamese, who wanted to condemn
                        Communists, and, for example, Singapore, which was anxious to avoid damaging
                        its trading and financial interests with both <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and Red China, was difficult.</p>
                    <p>3. This led <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> into further
                        derogatory comment on Singapore. He said that although leadership of
                        Singapore was perhaps free of any dominating influence by Peking, there were
                        many Chinese in Singapore who looked toward Communist China. For this reason
                        he thought great care should be taken in providing Singapore with weapons
                        which might be transferred to Communists. He made specific reference to
                            <gloss target="#t_M161">M–16</gloss> factory, production of which might
                        some day fall into hands of Communists. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] I explained to <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> genesis of Singapore's
                        acquisition of factory and limitations on and control of <gloss
                            target="#t_M161">M–16</gloss> production.</p>
                    <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0679"/>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> discussed briefly talks
                        he had had with both Cambodian and South Vietnamese Foreign Ministers about
                        possible Indonesian material assistance to Cambodia. He indicated that arms
                        and ammunition caches in Cambodian sanctuaries should provide source arms
                        and ammunition which Indonesia was in no position, in any case, to supply.
                        Cambodian army lacked training, however, in guerrilla warfare and there was
                        inadequate understanding of how army and people in Cambodia should work
                        together to defend Cambodia against <gloss target="#t_NVN1"
                            >NVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> indicated that Indonesia was
                        prepared to provide training in this general field.</p>
                    <p>5. I outlined to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> results
                        of study in Washington of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program we had
                        worked out with Hankam for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71. I mentioned
                        possibilities of substituting <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s for
                        T–37s, situation with respect to <gloss target="#t_C471">C–47</gloss>s,
                        substitutions we were considering in naval patrol craft, possible
                        availability of two lsts and possibility of requirement for communications
                        system for Hankam. I said it had become clear in going over our
                        recommendations that list we had submitted and substitutions which would
                        probably be required would come to great deal more than $10 million addition
                        to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. Some selectivity on basis of
                        priorities would be required. I said we would welcome <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s views on priorities.</p>
                    <p>6. In commenting on foregoing, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> began by describing additional difficulties which
                        Indonesia was undergoing in trying to get spare parts for Soviet equipment,
                        implying that Soviet-Indonesian relations had further deteriorated. He said
                        it had originally been planned to try to maintain this equipment and make it
                        do through five-year plan but that this, in the face of difficulties, indeed
                        impossibilities, of securing Soviet spare parts made this plan impractical.
                        It would be necessary to scrap Soviet cruiser, “West Irian”, destroyers and
                        some 16 other vessels which were completely useless. Likewise with antonovs,
                        of which three had been flying, it would be impossible to keep these going
                        beyond next overhaul requirements. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> said it was necessary, therefore, in terms of
                        Indonesia's internal defense and minimum deterrent to outside aggression to
                        find, by end of 1971, source of equipment for armed forces. Clearly he hopes
                        this will be the U.S.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he hopes to speak
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in terms of
                        possible commitment for four years beginning <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1972 which would permit some rational planning and relieve
                        him from trying set priorities now. This would make it possible to plan
                        equipment to be acquired for armed forces by end of four years and to adjust
                        in the meantime to availabilities and financial and other problems on U.S.
                        side.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said acquisition of
                        military equipment Indonesia will need to insure its internal security,
                        minimum of deterrent to outside agression and some potential for cooperating
                        in strategic terms with U.S. in area could be provided on either grant or
                        credit basis or both.</p>
                    <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0680"/>
                    <p>9. I told <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that I couldn't
                        comment on possibilities beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71
                        commitment which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had
                        already decided. I thought it would be difficult for President, in face of
                        Congressional questioning of expanded military involvement in Southeast
                        Asia, to make forward commitment of this kind and I knew he would not want
                        to make commitment unless he was certain he could fulfill it. I assured
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would listen sympathetically.</p>
                    <p>10. Replying to my question what other subjects he might want to discuss,
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> mentioned need for
                        capital investment needed to effect increased timber exports and income
                        therefrom and to stimulate tourism and investment in facilities therefore.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> indicated desire to
                        explore EX–IM Bank loans for purposes of expanding airports in Djakarta and
                        Bali to accommodate jumbo jets, which he felt would in turn bring private
                        investment in hotels and lead to quick increase in Indonesia's earnings from
                        tourism. In the case of timber, he said Indonesia is presently exporting at
                        the rate of about $10 million annually. This could easily be doubled and
                        one-tenth or more of cost of exporting this timber could be saved with
                        acquisition of Indonesian shipping (Indonesia now dependent on Japanese
                        shipping for exporting its timber which costing it large amount foreign
                        exchange, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said). Implied
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wants to discuss
                        Export-Import loan for acquiring ships for timber trade.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he will want to
                        express his appreciation to President for U.S. participation in and
                        leadership of <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> and donor effort. He
                        said additional and accelerated momentum to development process could be
                        achieved through increased attention to exploitation of timber and tourism
                        in Indonesia. He would want to discuss importance of this with President; it
                        was not unrelated to acquiring equipment needed for Indonesia's defense. I
                        told <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> it was hard for me
                        to guess what magnitudes he might be talking about in terms of Export-Import
                        loans but I sparked no response from him on this.</p>

                        are giving Indonesia in supply of spare parts for Soviet military equipment
                        and possibly accelerating threat of Communist aggression in neighboring
                        countries, that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> will want
                        to talk mainly about enlarged and accelerated flow of military equipment
                        from U.S., beginning, as he put it, after elections in 1971.</p>

                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and told President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> how much he had enjoyed his
                        visit to Indonesia. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        then inquired about the state of Indonesia's economy. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> replied that his economy was
                        progressing in accordance with his approved program. The five-year plan was
                        working well and Indonesia is taking steps to abolish the dual exchange rate
                        and is working to adjust the oil rate. However, progress in the economic
                        field, while encouraging, is not enough for the population which wants a
                        speedup. Indonesia also must speed it up to destroy the remnants of the
                        Communist Party.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked what the
                        strength of the Communist Party was and whether there is a real danger or is
                        it under control. President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> replied that strategically the Communist Party had
                        been nullified. Ten percent of the old body of the hard-core members still
                        exist even though thousands are in jail. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then inquired about the Indonesian
                        students' attitude on the Communists. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said that he thought the
                        student movement was under control, pointing out that Indonesia is making
                        students participate in development projects with good results. Students go
                        into the villages to carry out government work and this way they do not have
                        so much time to become ideological.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then asked what
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> thought of
                        United States problems in Indonesia. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> replied that the progress in
                        the Indonesian economy is, of course, in the first instance the result of
                        Indonesian efforts, but foreign governments certainly have helped. Indonesia
                        is aware that the United States has difficulties with <pb n="633"
                            xml:id="pg_633" facs="0682"/>Congress in getting appropriations and it
                        appreciates that despite this the United States has increased its aid to
                        Indonesia. In addition, foreign capital and the World Bank have been very
                        helpful and Indonesia has appreciated U.S. assistance in rescheduling its
                        debt.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said we want to be of
                        every assistance consistent with respect for Indonesia's non-aligned status.
                        Indonesia will continue to have U.S. support. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> added, “The principle I wish to
                        emphasize is this: we do not want to interfere in Indonesian affairs, but we
                        want Indonesia to be strong enough so that no one else can interfere.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> thanked the
                        President for his expression of respect for Indonesia's non-aligned status,
                        which will be used to preserve peace in Asia and especially Southeast Asia.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he was
                        convinced that a sound economic situation produces a commitment to peace but
                        improving economic conditions is, by itself, not enough. “Military strength
                        is also essential. We cannot neglect military strength. In the first few
                        years of office, I have put top priority on economic strength, but now
                        Indonesia must give attention to military strength as well. Assistance is
                        especially needed for the navy and air force. Given Communist strength we
                        cannot neglect defense, especially air force and navy patrol craft.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> stated further
                        that the Chinese <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> threat was now
                        beginning to give the Chinese the capability of reaching countries even as
                        remote as Indonesia. The military leaders in Indonesia recognize that
                        Indonesia must move step by step and not get over-ambitious. However, Soviet
                        infiltration in Asia and in the Indian Ocean makes it necessary to
                        strengthen the <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability around
                        Indonesia. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed
                        that Indonesia's military strength was necessary for both external and
                        internal reasons. He added that President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> was correct in putting first priority on economic
                        matters, but neutrality is meaningless unless the neutral can defend its
                        neutrality.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he had
                        already talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName> and that the Ambassador wanted to move step by
                        step.</p>
                    <p>It was very important from now on to know what kind of assistance the U.S.
                        can give Indonesia. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        confirmed that the U.S. would give Indonesia's requests very sympathetic
                        consideration, recognizing its desires are defensive. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> replied it is an important part
                        of Indonesia's responsibility to make sure other states in the area are
                        convinced of the seriousness of the situation in Cambodia. Indonesia
                        received a Cambodian request for help. The limitations in Indonesia's
                        capabilities make it impossible to do much in the military field, but they
                        are giving all political and moral support and attempting to line up others.
                        Political activities have included the Djakarta Conference whose main aim is
                        the territorial integrity <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0683"/>of
                        Cambodia, elimination of foreign troops, and reactivating of the Geneva 1954
                        Accords. A commission of three has been appointed to look into it, but there
                        also exists a military difficulty. <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                            Nol</persName>'s Government has only 35,000 soldiers facing larger and
                        more experienced forces. The involvement of the U.S. and South Vietnamese
                        forces was essential strategically to give Cambodians a chance to help
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>The crucial role of sanctuary operations cannot be overemphasized, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> added. They will help
                        Vietnamization. President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        urged President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to give the
                        equipment captured in Cambodia to the Cambodian Government, stressing that
                        the relations between the Cambodians and the South Vietnamese was not
                        especially good. Also, the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>
                        Government realizes the continuing need to deal with <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                            >VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> on Cambodian
                        territory after the United States withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>Summing up, President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        stated, “we hope that sanctuary operations will smash the military strength
                        of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_NVA1"
                            >NVA</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>. At this time, the Indonesians can give
                        only training support, especially in anti-guerrilla warfare. Indonesia is
                        limited in its ability to give military support because of limited resources
                        and because of economic priorities. However, they would certainly be
                        prepared to do so if resources would be freed.” President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked whether President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> considered the survival of
                        Cambodia important for Indonesia and other countries in the area. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> replied
                        affirmatively, stressing the need for the actual neutrality of Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> suggested that some
                        people say the U.S. should have let Cambodia go since it would have made no
                        difference. President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        replied that this attitude is reflected only by those who do not live in the
                        area, adding, “if Cambodia falls into Communist hands, it will be an
                        expanded base for guerrilla and infiltration activities; Vietnamization
                        could not succeed.” President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        stated that the U.S. has no designs on Cambodia and will leave as soon as
                        the sanctuaries have been destroyed. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                        will react, however, if <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> sanctuaries are
                        restored. The war in Vietnam, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> continued, has been a very difficult war for the
                        United States. Many want us to pull out. We have not and will not do so, not
                        because we have designs, but because to do so would demoralize all of
                        Southeast Asia including the Indonesian people. Therefore, it is also
                        important that the local people speak up. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said Indonesia had this idea
                        from the beginning, but when Indonesia proposed to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> that it send equipment for the
                        battalions of the Cambodian army, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName> doubted that the U.S. could replace this <pb

                            >Green</persName> to provide a brief survey of the situation in East

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> outlined the principles which
                        underlie the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and noted
                        that, while the Cambodian situation has injected a new element into
                        Southeast Asia, our policy there is completely consistent with these
                        principles. The President's action in sending troops into Cambodia, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> pointed out, is designed to
                        protect and advance the policy of Vietnamization and increase prospects for
                        Cambodia's stability and friendly cooperation with its neighbors. Referring
                        to a Harris poll the previous day which showed that a majority of the
                        American people support the President on this issue, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated that the success of our action
                        in Cambodia would increase this popular support.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> noted that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine does not mean that
                        we are in the process of disengaging or running out on our commitments but
                        represents an adjustment of U.S. policy to actual conditions. It reflects
                        increased Asian capability for and interest in regional cooperation, the
                        declining influence of ideology and the fact neither super power is in a
                        position to push others around. For these and other reasons, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> explained, the President has
                        decided that we should adjust, but not abandon, our role in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> emphasized that the
                        U.S. does not seek a military victory in Southeast Asia and noted that we
                        have placed definite restraints on our actions regarding North Vietnam. The
                        U.S. believes that it will have discharged its obligation to the people of
                        South Vietnam if they are given freedom to choose their own course.</p>
                    <p>The United States recognizes the importance of Indonesia as a nonaligned
                        country, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> said, and can
                        envisage as a possible solution of the conflict a situation in which all of
                        Indochina might be non-aligned, if this is what these nations want. The U.S.
                        commitment to the people of South Vietnam is to help them attain a position
                        in which they can reach their own solutions rather than be forced to accept
                        those dictated by others.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he wished to make clear
                        that Indonesia has no misapprehensions regarding the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine but, in fact, believes that
                        it is time for some rethinking along these lines by the U.S. Indonesia
                        hopes, however, that under this new doctrine the U.S., as a super power, <pb
                            n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0686"/>will not equate all problems of
                        Southeast Asia. The Indonesian Government understands the domestic problems
                        which the U.S. faces but nonetheless believes it important that the U.S.
                        stress and even increase its commitments as far as certain problems are
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> perceived two distinct facets of
                        communists' strategic approach, the more moderate public line of the Soviet
                        Union and the militant position of Communist China. This divergence in the
                        communist camp has an impact on world opinion and on domestic opinion.
                        Indonesia would like to expose the communists' views so that they are not
                        able to play both sides of the street.</p>
                    <p>Until now, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> continued, the
                        impression has been created through communist propaganda that the communists
                        are all right and the U.S. is all wrong. Demonstrators aiming at ending U.S.
                        support for Vietnam's struggle forget that the communists have been
                        attempting to subvert South Vietnam for a long time. The Djakarta Conference
                        was designed, among other things, to open the eyes of the world to the true
                        state of affairs, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> explained.</p>

                        VISIT—CONCURRENT WHITE HOUSE TALKS</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is the list of participants, which is identical to that in <ref
                            target="#d296">Document 296</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> explained that the U.S.
                        crossed the Cambodian border to insure our ability to carry forward with
                        Vietnamization and not to insure the survival of the Cambodian Government.
                        This latter objective can best be served by the diplomatic initiatives. In
                        this connection, <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0687"/>the United States
                        is interested in proposals for an international conference to discuss
                        Cambodia and related matters, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1"
                            >Richardson</persName> continued. French suggestions in this regard were
                        promising. At one point <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> of the
                        Soviet Union seemed to be saying much the same thing, but unfortunately
                        nothing materialized from his remarks. The U.S. has also watched with quiet
                        interest Indonesia's initiatives in calling the May 16–17 Foreign Ministers
                        Conference in Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> explained that, although
                        Indonesia should logically concentrate first on economic development and its
                        internal problems, it sees a connection between Cambodian events and
                        Indonesia's own security. India opposed the idea of the Djakarta Conference,
                        preferring to wait and discuss Indochina in the forum of the Non-aligned
                        Conference. Indonesia did not accept this view, first because of the need to
                        act quickly (the Non-aligned Conference will be held in September) and
                        secondly because, if past performance is any indication, that Conference
                        would give the communists an additional opportunity to spread their
                        propaganda unless thorough preparations were made in advance.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia consequently decided to invite 21 nations to a meeting in Djakarta,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> continued. Invitations were
                        sent to Communist China, North Vietnam, North Korea and Mongolia to see if
                        these nations really wanted to solve the problem through negotiations.
                        Indonesia concluded that it was better to continue with the Conference even
                        though the communists refused to attend.</p>
                    <p>Noting the importance of Moscow's reaction to the Djakarta Conference,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said Indonesia advised the
                        Soviet Union twice regarding the Conference. Although Pravda and Izvestia
                        opposed the Conference, officially there has been no reaction from Moscow
                        except a question as to why Peking was invited. Indonesia perceives some
                        hesitation in the Soviet Union's policy towards Cambodia. The Soviets have
                        not closed their Embassy in Phnom Penh and, just before he left Phnom Penh
                        for the Djakarta Conference, Cambodian Foreign Minister Yem Sambaur received
                        assurances from the Soviet Ambassador that the U.S.S.R. was not in a hurry
                        to break off relations with Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> noted that the Djakarta
                        Conference had encountered difficulties because of the different approaches
                        recommended by various participants. South Vietnam and Thailand wanted to
                        condemn North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Cambodia, for its part, wished to
                        use the Conference as a forum to mount a major push for military assistance.
                        Indonesia managed to convince the Cambodians the day before the Conference
                        opened that they should not do so or they would jeopardize Indonesian
                        efforts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he had
                        explained to Yem Sambaur that the aim of the Conference was not to assist
                        Cambodia in waging war and that it would be disadvantageous to give the
                        impression that the Conference was beating war drums for the Cambodians.</p>
                    <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0688"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> noted that the participants did
                        not wish the Djakarta Conference to be a one-shot affair. They consequently
                        empowered Indonesia as Chairman to take all necessary steps to carry out the
                        agreed decisions and appointed Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia as their
                        representatives to carry their views to the Geneva Conference Co-Chairmen,
                        the three members of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Those nations which declined to attend the
                        Conference will also be informed of the results of the meeting, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> noted.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> believed that the flexible
                        decisions of the Djakarta Conference may reinforce <persName
                            corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>'s view that there should be an
                        international conference on Indochina. The major key to such a Conference is
                        Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said, adding that in his
                        opinion the Russians have not yet made up their minds on this question.
                        France, Germany and the United Kingdom seem agreeable to convening a
                        Geneva-type conference, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> added,
                        but this cannot be hurried. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said
                        that the U.S. could play an important role in bringing about such a
                        conference, but this role cannot be too open. If the U.S. enters too
                        directly into the picture, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said,
                        there is danger that the other side will use this fact in its propaganda to
                        defeat the possibility of a conference. Appropriate ways should be found to
                        press the Soviet Union to agree to a Geneva-conference on Indochina,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> added.</p>
                    <p>Referring to North Vietnamese claims that they are willing to fight for
                        another 100 years, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said there
                        are actually indications that North Vietnam is tired of the war. If the
                        Soviet Union can be drawn into a conference, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> continued, this could have a constructive influence on
                        Hanoi. It is also necessary to exert pressure on North Vietnamese troops in
                        Laos and in the Thai–Laotian–Cambodian border area similar to the pressure
                        exerted in the fishhook area of Cambodia, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> said, while acknowledging the possibility that this
                        could cause North Vietnam in turn to step up its pressure on Cambodia. In
                        addition to Indonesia's diplomatic efforts, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> envisaged two means of aiding Cambodia: </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> expressed doubt that Communist
                        China will intervene in Indochina, suggesting that its strategy is rather to
                        arouse opposition to U.S. policy and put the Soviet Union in an increasingly
                        difficult spot. A Geneva-type conference would force Peking into the open
                        and prevent it from continuing this strategy, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> explained.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> agreed that diplomatic
                        initiatives clearly offer the best prospects for preserving Cambodia's
                        neutrality and stabilizing the situation. In this and other respects the
                        role of the Soviet Union is crucial. The extent to which it can influence or
                        is influenced by Hanoi is an open question.</p>

                    <p>The United States fully supports the efforts of the Three Nation Committee

                        them the “kiss of death.” The United States will keep in close touch with
                        the Indonesians regarding means of helping without compromising the efforts

                        VISIT—CONCURRENT WHITE HOUSE TALKS</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is the list of participants, which is identical to that in <ref
                            target="#d296">Document 296</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> noted that participants in
                        the Djakarta Conference agreed that they should concentrate on finding a
                        peaceful solution to the Cambodian problem, leaving the matter of military
                        aid for bilateral negotiations. The Cambodians nonetheless informally asked
                        all of the participants for weapons and even troops. The Indonesians
                        understood that Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and some others have
                        promised aid.</p>
                    <p>Cambodian Foreign Minister Yem Sambaur had high hopes of obtaining military
                        aid from Indonesia, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> continued,
                        but the Indonesians explained that the maximum they could give was training
                        assistance. Providing the Cambodians with an adequate supply of weapons
                        would not seem too difficult, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        said, if arms captured by South Vietnamese and U.S. troops could be given to
                        Cambodia. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> explained that,
                        according to Indonesian information there was, however, another problem over
                        and above the shortage of arms: the Cambodian Armed Forces are not yet able
                        to <hi rend="italic">handle</hi> any significant volume of arms. <pb n="641"
                            xml:id="pg_641" facs="0690"/>They need training first, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said, and Indonesia can perhaps help
                        in this field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> remarked that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> seemed to envisage two concurrent
                        courses of action regarding Cambodia: diplomatic efforts, which depended in
                        good part on the Soviet Union and the outcome of which is not yet clear, and
                        action to keep the Cambodian Government afloat while these diplomatic
                        efforts are proceeding. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                        noted that the U.S. is giving limited support to Cambodia, primarily in the
                        form of small arms. The U.S. hopes that others will provide support also,
                        not only because it is needed militarily, but also because this support
                        would provide a psychological boost to the Cambodian Government and signal
                        to Moscow and others that the countries of the area are willing to work
                        together to preserve peace.</p>
                    <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s question on
                        how Indonesia would help Cambodia in the field of training, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> explained that Indonesia had in mind
                        bringing Cambodians quietly to Indonesia for training in guerrilla warfare.
                        They could be blanketed with other nationalities training there, he added,
                        without attracting undue attention. Indonesia is also considering sending
                        Indonesian instructors to Cambodia, which <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> felt would reveal Indonesia's hand too openly. Another
                        possibility, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said, is the
                        attaching of some officers to the Indonesian Embassy in Phnom Penh to help
                        advise the Cambodian Government on military matters in a liaison capacity.
                        This matter is still under discussion by Indonesian defense officials,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said, and a decision has not
                        yet been made.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said Indonesia was caught
                        between two difficult problems: <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                            Nol</persName> Government fail on the other.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said there was one related
                        matter he wanted to mention. According to Indonesia's information, Cambodia
                        does not have direct, open contacts with the U.S. on matters such as
                        military aid; as a result, Cambodia is trying to channel its requests
                        through third countries. Perhaps, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> said, the U.S. could calm Cambodia by giving more
                        direct proof of its support. The Cambodians, for example, have mentioned to
                        the Indonesians the possibility of dealing with the U.S. on military matters
                        through the former U.S. military attaché in Phnom Penh who is well known to
                        the Cambodian military.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> assured <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> that we are in direct touch with the
                        Government of Cambodia through our Chargé in Phnom Penh on aid and all other
                        matters and that additional channels are not needed.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> said that his President
                        had ordered him to see Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        as a continuation of the previous day's discussion. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had felt that it would be
                        better to give more explanation concerning Indonesia's request for military
                        assistance. This position had also been explained to Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>, who at that moment was still busy
                        with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SVA1">Sudomo</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Since 1965, Indonesia has been concentrating on peaceful development of its
                        economic and political stability. However, following the Cambodian affair,
                        when things were moving very fast, President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> had decided—while still adhering to Indonesia's
                        basic principles of non-alignment—that it must take a greater interest in
                        Southeast Asia developments. The Djakarta conference was an outgrowth of
                        this decision. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> went on
                        to describe the nature of the conference, and the agreements which have been
                        reached for ongoing diplomatic initiatives to end the war in Indo-China.) At
                        the conference, all of the countries except Singapore had been very worried
                        at the situation in Cambodia and surrounding countries, and also about the
                        spread of Communism. Their representatives had brought this out in
                        conversations with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName>. They had also expressed their full confidence in
                        Indonesia. Hence Indonesia, which since 1965 had never stressed military
                        affairs, now felt that it had a special role with respect not only to
                        Cambodia but to the surrounding countries. <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon
                            Nol</persName> had twice approached Indonesia on the possibility of
                        obtaining Indonesian weapons. This request had been made known to the U.S.
                        at President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s suggestion
                        through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName>, but no
                        reply had been received.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered whether there
                        might be a problem here in that the Indonesian Foreign Minister didn't want
                        to give arms. Nevertheless, <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0692"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wanted to send arms, our
                        President would be sympathetic.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> expressed the opinion that
                        his Foreign Minister would not say anything other than what his President
                        suggested, since he knew he could be replaced if he acted otherwise. In any
                        event, as President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had
                        suggested through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName>, the Indonesians were prepared to send sufficient
                        weapons to Cambodia to equip 10 battalions. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> mentioned that we had never received a formal
                        proposal to this effect, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> replied that it was correct to say that there had
                        been no formal proposal, but that the proposition had been passed along and
                        only three people had known about it in Indonesia: President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> himself, and <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">This exchange between
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> went a long way towards
                            answering <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s question “What
                            did you find out on this thing?” that he posed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in their telephone
                            conversation of May 26. Following the question, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> ordered that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> “check this out with the
                            Ambassador. We want the Indonesians' help. I want it done. That is a
                            policy decision. It is vitally important to have other countries help
                            them in some way. Now here is a country that is willing to help. We
                            tried to get the Thais. But now this country wants to help. What in the
                            hell happened here.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded: “It is part of the problem we talked about before. We have to
                            make these departments more responsive.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> continued, “If Indonesia wants to send this
                            ammunition, they should do it. The Soviets of course are taking on
                                <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>. As long as he appears
                            to be a puppet of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> it is one thing
                            but when I ordered this three weeks ago that is the way it is to be. We
                            have got to get the military to shape up and get it done. I want the
                            Indonesians to send some stuff. We will replace their stuff. Of course
                            we will get a military request from Indonesia anyway. So let's see what
                            we can accomplish.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            then promised that “I will have it done by tomorrow evening.” (Library

                            >Alamsjah</persName> noted that the Indonesia proposal had been made
                        three weeks to a month ago, and involved sending small arms, including
                        mortars, but no artillery. The Indonesians had also brought up a related
                        problem—if they sent arms they would need replacement stocks, and would
                        expect these from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if the quantity of

                            >Alamsjah</persName> explained that he had touched on this matter with
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> the preceding evening,
                        and that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had afterwards
                        decided that he, <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>, had to see
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Cambodia's military requirements, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> said that there were two urgent matters for
                        Indonesia to consider. First, there was the matter of weapons, and there was
                        also training. On training, if possible the Indonesians would like to send
                        Cambodians to Indonesia for guerrilla training. Many foreign students had
                        received such training, since Indonesia's experience in dealing with
                        guerrilla warfare was the greatest among all Southeast Asia armed forces. In
                        addition, <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0693"/>if the Cambodian
                        situation became urgent, Indonesia could send officers to Cambodia who would
                        be carried as personnel of the Indonesian Embassy but who would train the
                        Cambodian forces.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that he had
                        been told the preceding evening that Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had been most unhappy about what our
                        President had said to President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        doubted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had been
                        unhappy, and referred again to the fact that the Foreign Minister was
                        subject to the orders of the President.</p>
                    <p>To recapitulate the Indonesian proposal for aid to Cambodia, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if it was correct that they
                        were willing to send military equipment to Cambodia immediately, that the
                        amount would be sufficient for ten battalions, and that they would want us
                        to replace these stocks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        agreed. On replacement, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        asked over what period? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        replied as soon as possible, since removing these arms from their supplies
                        would leave an empty hole. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> then asked how this should be handled as a
                        practical matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        referred again to the military mission which his President wanted to send.
                        In addition to the point of aid to Cambodia, however, there was a second
                        point concerning the general state of the Indonesian armed forces. For ten
                        years the Navy and Air Force equipment had all come from the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and now spare parts were unavailable. As
                        he had mentioned to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>, a
                        Navy without gunboats was useless, and pilots without aircraft were useless.
                        He indicated that he was thinking not only in terms of Indonesia, but in
                        terms of the other countries of the region except Singapore. Indonesia was
                        being counted on by these others, but they did not know the real power of
                        the Indonesian military sector. The U.S. had a military advisory and
                        assistance system, but Indonesia was not a member. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> had suggested to Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_SVA1">Sudomo</persName> that it would be impossible for the
                        U.S. to re-equip the Indonesian Navy and Air Force, even though these forces
                        possessed tactical skills.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained that our
                        problem was with Congress. Nevertheless, we would like to help, and would do
                        our best. The President was sympathetic. We had more than tripled our <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Indonesia, although we recognized that
                        this was still not enough. We would like to look into the problem of surplus
                        equipment from Vietnam at lower costs, but the problem of Congress remained.
                        How could we get an idea of the Indonesian needs? Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> again referred to their military
                        mission.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that the
                        President had reiterated the same morning that he was anxious to cooperate
                        fully with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> on
                        the matters which he had discussed with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> the previous day on aid to
                        Cambodia. He had found President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>'s attitude very encouraging.</p>
                    <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0694"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted briefly that the
                        Indonesians also had a problem in connection with the Bandung munitions
                        factory. We would take this matter up and let them know. The amount was not
                        great, being only somewhat more than $3 million, and we would be sympathetic
                        in reviewing the Indonesia aid request. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> stated that their military mission should bring a
                        complete proposal with it.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the equipment for the 10 battalions, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we would look at this
                        matter with the intention of being helpful and knowing that this was in the
                        spirit of what the President wanted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> asked about the
                        possibility of taking care of some of the Indonesian needs prior to the
                        elections, particularly those of the Air Force. In sending weapons to
                        Cambodia they planned to use air transportation from Indonesian to Cambodian
                        airports. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that
                        we would do the best that we could, and asked how soon the military mission
                        would come. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> said it would
                        arrive not more than three weeks from now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> observed that the mission would be led by the top
                        Indonesian Army man, General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had met in Djakarta
                        last year, was now concentrating on internal Indonesian affairs and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName> was responsible for broader
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> reverted to the question
                        of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s attitude
                        on aid to Cambodia, and recalled at yesterday's advisers' meeting he had
                        made a very strong pitch for military assistance. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned, however, that he had
                        expressed some doubts about this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> thought that these doubts referred to sending arms
                        only if there was no replacement.</p>
                    <p>The meeting closed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        expressing confidence that the press problem could be handled, and with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> emphasizing once more
                        the President's pleasure over his conversation with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. The President understood
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s view, and saw
                        eye-to-eye with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        on maintaining Indonesia's formal policy of non-alignment.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName>Henry</persName>:</p>
                    <p>In response to your suggestion this morning, I list below a phased program
                        through which Indonesia might help Cambodia without unduly interfering with
                        its diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Cambodia or seriously complicating
                        its internal or external position. We cannot at this time fix a time phase
                        for this program but would have to remain flexible, keying later steps to
                        the progress of Indonesia's diplomatic efforts. As I see it, there are four
                        major areas in which we might expect the Indonesians to be helpful:</p>
                    <p>1. First, as top priority, the Indonesians should be encouraged to continue
                        their present diplomatic efforts. The Three Nation committee appointed
                        during the recent Djakarta Conference will be contacting the Co-Chairmen and
                        members of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> as well as key U.N.
                        officials during the next few weeks to consider ways in which Cambodia's
                        independence can be preserved. The Indonesians are realistic enough not to
                        expect dramatic results. Concurrently, they will push Cambodia's case within
                        the non-aligned forum. A preparatory meeting for the September Non-aligned
                        Conference will be held in New Delhi on June 8. The Indonesians expect the
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> government in exile to
                        make a major bid to be seated during this meeting. Indonesia will support
                        the <persName corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName> government, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName> believes it important that
                        Indonesia take no action before that time which might compromise its
                        credentials with the Afro-Asian group.</p>
                    <p>2. Indonesia has apparently already decided to provide some military training
                        to the Cambodian armed forces. While details have not yet been worked out,
                        they are considering the possibility of bringing Cambodians to Indonesia for
                        training in Indonesia's service schools, particularly those concerned with
                        counter-guerrilla activities. This will not be publicized. They are
                        reluctant thus far to send advisers to Cambodia since this would be even
                        more difficult to conceal but have mentioned the possibility of assigning
                        several military experts to their Embassy <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647"
                            facs="0696"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. We should now begin exploring quietly with the Indonesians the possibility
                        of Indonesia converting its ammunition plant near Bandung to produce
                        ammunition for the <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss>. We do not know
                        how big a job this would be, but we believe it would be manageable and
                        acceptable to Indonesia provided that, through some indirect offsetting
                        arrangement, we helped them meet the costs involved. Indonesia has on-going
                        need for some <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss> ammunition and would be
                        in a position to sell much of the plant's output to Cambodia, which has
                        urgent requirements for such ammunition.</p>
                    <p>4. A final step, which I believe should be delayed until the above steps are
                        further advanced, is the provision of military equipment by Indonesia to
                        Cambodia. Indirect offsetting arrangements with the U.S. (within agreed
                        limits) are necessarily involved.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and others are concerned that
                        providing weapons to Cambodia at this time would complicate Indonesia's
                        current diplomatic efforts and also trigger opposition among domestic left
                        wing as well as traditional groups which fear a basic shift in Indonesia's
                        foreign policy of non-alignment.</p>
                    <p>As I mentioned this morning, the Indonesians seem to be placing top priority
                        during this visit in getting a commitment from us to replace their Soviet
                        military equipment. This equipment had an original price tag of nearly $1
                        billion. Some Indonesians hope, by giving arms to Cambodia, to put us in
                        their debt and improve chances for such a commitment.</p>
                    <p>There is also the danger of exaggerated expectations on the part of the
                        Indonesian military. I have been through this once. In 1966 some of the
                        Indonesian Generals received the impression following a visit to Washington
                        that we were going to give them arms to the tune of $500 million. This, of
                        course, was impossible, but it took nearly a year to convince them of this
                        fact. Meanwhile, our relations with the Indonesians were strained and I was

                            >Suharto</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We should also bear in mind the fact that the Indonesians are already having
                        difficulty absorbing what they are receiving. Skilled personnel are in short
                        supply, and maintenance procedures are poor. At present, they could not
                        effectively use more than they are getting through our expanded $15 million
                        annual program.</p>
                    <p>The problem, as I see it, is essentially one of timing. I believe we can
                        successfully avoid the problems of exaggerated expectations as well as
                        internal or external damage to Indonesia's position if we follow the phased
                        program outlined above and keep flexible. Steps one and two <pb n="648"
                            xml:id="pg_648" facs="0697"/>are already underway in any event and
                        should prove helpful to Cambodia while we assess further steps.</p>

                    <p>The President: I consider this an historical opportunity because we are the
                        two largest democratic countries of the world, with the exception of India.
                        You and <persName>Henry</persName> both know that I would like to travel to
                        Indonesia again before the end of my present term. I always emphasize to my
                        American colleagues the economic and strategic importance of Indonesia in
                        Southeast Asia. Most people know about Thailand, Cambodia or Vietnam but not
                        many people know very much about Indonesia. This is because there are not
                        many opportunities to travel there.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>: I am very happy
                        with your evaluation concerning the important role of Indonesia in Southeast
                        Asia. The fact that you would like to return again is a sign of our close
                        friendship. The Indonesian people will always welcome you with an open
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>: Concerning
                        military matters, I have appointed Lt. Gen. Sumitro to take charge of these
                        affairs and I have in mind to appoint a reserve officer also. In the future
                        I will also appoint an additional limited number of officers to work in this
                        field.</p>
                    <p>The President: What is the rank of your military attaché here in
                        Washington?</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>: There are
                        three—Air Force, Army and Navy. The Air Force Attaché is a Colonel, the Navy
                        Attaché is a Colonel and <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0698"/>the Army
                        Attaché is a Brigadier General. The Army Attaché was trained in Russia but
                        he is also a member of the revolutionary generation of 1945.</p>
                    <p>The President: I would like to have one military attaché in Djakarta to have
                        my complete confidence. The rank is not important but it shouldn't be out of
                        line with the rank of the Indonesian attaché in Washington. To <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>—I wanted more than that. I would
                        like to upgrade this position in Djakarta.</p>
                    <p>The President: Quite frankly we must recognize that there is resistance both
                        in Indonesia and in the United States to a large military assistance program
                        for Indonesia. We do not want to compromise your non-aligned position. There
                        is also a fear in the United States that increased military assistance will
                        be a financial burden. But you and I as politicians must recognize these
                        political realities. We would like to work out an arrangement to fulfill the
                        needs of Indonesia without any embarrassment to your political situation.
                        These needs should be met so that Indonesia may play a larger role in
                        Southeast Asia. For example, when the Cambodian problem began, they turned
                        to Indonesia for assistance but your capabilities were limited. Your
                        equipment was all old. We may be helpful there. Looking at the broader
                        picture in Southeast Asia and Asia, the larger countries such as Japan and
                        Indonesia should play an effective role. The role of Japan can only be in
                        the economic field. In Southeast Asia itself, Indonesia is the largest
                        country and can perhaps lead the way in collective security arrangements but
                        always within the framework of the necessity to maintain your nonaligned
                        position. Indonesia as a neutral country must be strong enough to defend
                        itself against minor assaults. But it is not enough only to insure ones own
                        neutrality. If a nation believes that its neutrality is only for its own
                        self interest and has no role when a smaller nation goes down, that nation
                        itself will become the next target.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>: Thank you very
                        much. My view is not much different from yours. Indonesia must be strong
                        economically, socially, and militarily in order to develop the will and
                        capacity to resist ideological, political and military attacks. We will
                        continue to carry out our active and independent foreign policy, but we
                        place great importance on working together with the other Asian neighbors. I
                        recognize also that there is fear within the area that Indonesia will become
                        too strong. But this fear is completely unjustified. Our philosophy,
                        Pantjasila, does not permit us to expand in relation to other countries and
                        peoples or to attack other countries. This is absolutely contrary to
                        Pantjasila. I have made it clear to you and to the members of the Senate
                        Foreign Relations Committee that our first priority is economic development,
                        but this also must be related to security measures. We must not neglect
                        military development but this must not be so rapid that it hampers economic
                            <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0699"/>development. Concerning the
                        possibility of a strategic capability for Indonesia in the long-range
                        future, I feel that training can be carried out in the U.S. and this
                        training can be put to use later if needed.</p>
                    <p>The President: I hope that we can work out the appropriate cooperation in an
                        agreeable way. We welcome your military mission.</p>
                    <p>I would like to emphasize our appreciation for the initiative of Indonesia in
                        sponsoring the recent conference concerning Cambodia. The initiative of
                        Asian nations is very important. Who knows where the next problem will
                        occur? It may be in Burma or it may be in Laos again. But when something
                        happens it is heart-warming to see a country such as Indonesia speaking up
                        and gathering together other Asian nations to discuss the problem. When a
                        country is under attack it seems as if it always ends up with the question
                        of what the U.S. is going to do. The U.S. becomes the issue but the issue
                        should be the small country which is under attack. We do not intend to
                        withdraw from Asia. Our intention is to help you to do what you decide is
                        best. There is no American imperialism. We seek no colonies. We do not want
                        any bases.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>: We understand
                        completely the role of the United States and we are convinced that the
                        United States is waging a just struggle for independence and freedom in
                        Southeast Asia. Concerning our role in Southeast Asia, we must keep in mind
                        our limited capabilities for activity outside of the borders of our own
                        country. A larger role for Indonesia in Southeast Asia depends upon the rate
                        of acceleration of our economic development program. If we were to undertake
                        actions which were beyond our capabilities, this would certainly endanger
                        our domestic situation. There are four conclusions which I would like to
                        present to you. First, we are pleased that the United States understands our
                        efforts in the field of economic development and we appreciate the aid of
                        the United States in these efforts. Secondly, we appreciate the manner in
                        which the United States respects our non-aligned position. Thirdly, we hope
                        that the United States fully supports the recent 11-nation Asian conference
                        on Cambodia which was held at Djakarta. Fourthly, we fully support the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine or the Guam
                        Doctrine and hope that it will continue to be carried out.</p>
                    <p>The President: Very good. Very good.</p>

                        deep appreciation for the U.S. role, and in particular that of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName>, in assuring Indonesia sympathetic
                        treatment at the April meetings of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia
                            (<gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>) on economic aid and of the
                        “Paris Club” on the <persName>Sukarno</persName> debt problem. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> added, however, that Indonesia
                        required additional help at this particular state of economic development.
                        He noted that Indonesian efforts to procure aid from “socialist” countries
                        have not been productive but will continue. In the meantime, <pb n="652"
                            xml:id="pg_652" facs="0701"/>he wondered if there were additional
                        sources of U.S. assistance which might be tapped, mentioning in particular
                        the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> noted that the
                        multilateral <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> mechanism had enabled
                        Indonesia to obtain greater aggregate assistance than if it had dealt
                        bilaterally with individual donors. He added that, again, one of our reasons
                        for supporting a Paris Group solution of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName> debt was to provide Indonesia with essential
                        multilateral leverage in dealing with Eastern European creditors. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> noted that we had not
                        encouraged Indonesia to repudiate its debt to the Soviet Union in light of
                        the latter's importance as a source of military spare parts, as a potential
                        aid donor, and as an important future market for rubber and other natural
                        resources. Repudiation of the Soviet debt might also damage Indonesia's
                        credit worthiness, he added. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                        later expressed appreciation for the U.S. Aide Mémoire in which the U.S.
                        accepted the debt settlement worked out at Paris in April, which he said
                        would help Indonesia to move forward in negotiations with other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Regarding additional sources of U.S. assistance, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> said that progress made in
                        resolving the debt problem would permit the Export-Import Bank to talk with
                        the Indonesians about a possible resumption of the Bank's financing
                        activities in Indonesia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName>
                        pointed out that the Bank is already offering insurance for suppliers'
                        credits and is a participant in Freeport Sulphur's program. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> noted, however, that the
                        Export-Import Bank is not a foreign aid agency and its function is to
                        facilitate U.S. exports. He emphasized the need to consult fully with the
                        Resident Mission of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> in Djakarta on
                        the priority of projects for which Ex–Im financing might be sought.
                        Indonesia should be aware of the risk that aid donors might reduce their aid
                        should Indonesia indicate through Ex–Im transactions that it was entering a
                        phase where it could borrow on normal commercial terms.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> inquired whether the
                        Export-Import Bank could lend to the Indonesian private sector in order to
                        further contacts between private business in the two countries. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> expressed the opinion
                        that the Bank would wish to know about particular projects being considered
                        and the extent to which the Indonesian Government is involved, through
                        guarantees, for example. When queried whether there is not a means to get
                        around a requirement for government guarantees, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> suggested that representatives of
                        the Indonesian Government discuss the matter with the Export-Import
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> referred also to the
                        possibility of doing more in the field of scientific cooperation but did not
                        specify what he had in mind.</p>

                    <p>The May 28 meeting returned to the subject of U.S. military assistance raised
                        by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName> during
                        the May 26 meeting but not discussed because of lack of time.</p>
                    <p>At the earlier meeting, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that
                        Indonesian hopes for a peaceful solution of Southeast Asian problems should
                        not lead it to neglect its own internal defense. Economic development
                        remains Indonesia's top priority, he added, but Indonesia must also prepare
                        for the worst possible eventuality. Recent developments affecting Cambodia
                        have created concern in neighboring countries and have given rise to the
                        expectation in some quarters that Indonesia might help defend neighboring
                        states if a more serious situation developed. At present, Indonesia could
                        not do so, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said.</p>
                    <p>Referring to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s July
                        1969 conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> in Djakarta on military assistance, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said the Indonesian Navy and Air Force
                        remain in a most difficult position. Most of their equipment originated in
                        the Soviet Union which continues to take a hard-nosed attitude regarding
                        spare parts. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said there was not
                        time to go into details but the Indonesian Armed Forces could discuss the
                        problem with their counterparts. In this respect, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> mentioned the possibility of the United States sending
                        a delegation to Indonesia to determine its needs. In conclusion, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> pointed to the presence of <persName
                            corresp="#p_SVA1">Admiral Sudomo</persName> in President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s official party as an
                        indication of the importance Indonesia places on the defense aspect of
                        national development.</p>
                    <p>At <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s request, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MEE1">Masters</persName> summarized the current status of
                        the Military Assistance Program for Indonesia. He noted that the Indonesian
                        Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Defense Liaison Group in <pb n="654"
                            xml:id="pg_654" facs="0703"/>Djakarta seem to have reached a general
                        understanding on the items to be included in the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1971 program, which is to be increased almost threefold over
                        the current annual level. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE1">Masters</persName>
                        mentioned in particular that the U.S. hopes to help within budgetary
                        limitations to meet the Air Force's requirement for trainer and close
                        support aircraft, the Navy's need for patrol craft, and all of the Services'
                        needs for communication and electronic equipment. As for the latter
                        requirement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEE1">Masters</persName> noted that a
                        U.S. technical team has just completed an in-country survey and is now
                        drawing up its recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> asked if support for the
                        police is to be included in the expanded program. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MEE1">Masters</persName> said that the U.S. was tentatively
                        thinking of allocating approximately $300,000 of the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1971 program to meet police requests for communications
                        equipment, subject to the findings of the technical team which had also
                        explored police needs in this field.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName>Henry</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I have long believed that it is important for us to do whatever we possibly
                        could to encourage Asians to become more involved in their own affairs. I
                        deeply share the President's views—and your views— on this vital issue. Our
                        own problems will be much simpler when Asians speak with a common voice on
                        maters of mutual concern, when their present rudimentary efforts toward
                        regional cooperation and mutual security really take hold. In this
                        connection, I believe also that it <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0704"
                        />is important that Indonesia and the other nations of Southeast Asia assist
                        Cambodia. Their own security is clearly at stake.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, there are dangers involved in forcing the hand of Indonesia
                        and others too quickly. In the case of Indonesia, for example, too sudden or
                        too deep an involvement in Cambodia could upset fragile internal balances.
                        Nationalist political groups are already concerned that Indonesia is moving
                        too close to the West. Cambodia, if not properly handled, could give them
                        additional ammunition against the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> Government.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the handling of this problem could upset civil-military
                        relationships. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                        instincts on this matter are sound, but this is not true of some of his
                        close advisers. A number of these, including General <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>, are out to get <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>. If we induce Indonesia to move in a
                        way or in a time frame which discredits <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName> we will not only be damaging the effectiveness of a
                        man who has been of great assistance to us, but we may well be contributing
                        to a disturbance of the present delicate balance between military and civil
                        leaders in Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>We can already see in the case of Indonesia that some of the Generals are
                        using the Cambodian issue as a lever to get from us a broad commitment to
                        re-equip their armed forces. It would not only be politically undesirable
                        for us to take on this role but it would also be far beyond our present
                        capabilities. There is also the problem of Indonesia's limited absorptive
                        capability which we have discussed before.</p>
                    <p>I am, of course, not averse to a bit of judicious pressure, but if the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is to be
                        effective, these countries must themselves recognize the danger and be
                        prepared to act on their own. If they do so largely at our behest, they will
                        expect us to pay the bill.</p>
                    <p>Your conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                        >Alamsjah</persName>, unlike that between the President and <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, causes me concern. Given the
                        curious workings of the Indonesian scene, the three references which you
                        made to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s doubts about Indonesia
                        providing military aid to Cambodia could jeopardize his position, although I
                        know this was not your intent. I am concerned in particular by the fact that
                        you signalled to <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had on May 26 expressed his
                        misgivings directly to us.</p>
                    <p>As I mentioned earlier, <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> is
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] a man who has been the target of intense criticism in
                        Indonesia for years. We learned reliably [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] several years ago that he hoped to
                        become Foreign Minister. For this and other reasons he is out to get
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, and I feel he will use your
                        remarks to further this objective. Frank Galbraith tells me that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> was very subdued during the trip
                        outside Washington. It may well be that <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> has already scored some points with <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> against <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0705"/>
                    <p>I am also aware that the military team which <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> plans to send will expect more than we could and
                        should give them. Your remarks that they should bring a “complete proposal
                        with them” may well be taken by the Indonesians as an invitation for another
                        unrealistic Indonesian shopping list. We have had a number of these over the
                        years and have only recently succeeded in getting the Indonesians to sit
                        down with our people and plan realistically regarding their military
                        requirements. As I told you last Wednesday morning, I was in coventry for
                        several months in 1967 (denied access to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        and others) due to frustrations by the Indonesian military who for some
                        reason had been led to expect during Pentagon visits that we would give far
                        more civic action aid than we delivered.</p>
                    <p>One way out of this difficulty, particularly that affecting <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s position, would be for the President
                        to send a message to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.
                        This could be in response to the message of thanks we will likely receive
                        from him or we could use the fact that June 8 is <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s birthday as the peg for a
                        message. In this message, the President might express his appreciation for
                        his useful talks with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                        confirm the fine impression which <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> left here with the Congress, the press, and others.
                        He could also extend warm regards from himself and Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, who made so many friends in
                        the U.S. He might then ask that his best regards be conveyed also to Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> whose astute handling
                        of Indonesian foreign policy has won admiration throughout the world,
                        including the U.S., and who played a particularly helpful role as catalyst
                        in bringing together the eleven nations which recently met in Djakarta to
                        discuss Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>If this were done, I think <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        would clearly get the signal that we support the diplomatic efforts
                        initiated by the Djakarta Conference and also <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                            >Malik</persName>'s continued role as Foreign Minister. If you agree, I
                        should be glad to try my hand at such a message.<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">

                    <p>Dear <persName>Henry</persName>:</p>
                    <p>As you know, a recent Djakarta message indicates that General Sumitro may
                        arrive here as early as next Monday (June 22) to follow up on the
                        discussions with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> last month. We do not yet have detailed knowledge
                        of just what the Indonesians have in mind, but it appears that Sumitro will
                        carry with him two lists. One will include military items they would expect
                        from us to replace any equipment they might give Cambodia, and the other
                        would deal with Indonesia's own long range military requirements. Sumitro
                        plans to see you first and follow your guidance on others he should talk
                        with in Washington.</p>
                    <p>The Indonesians apparently then plan to send a second military mission in
                        July to be led by the Army Chief of Staff, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>, and including logistical experts
                        from all of the armed services. According to word from Djakarta, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName> mission will seek a “fixed
                        commitment” from us to re-equip Indonesia's Armed Forces over the next five
                        to seven years.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s visit here
                        gave new impetus and direction to the Indonesians' as yet only partially
                        formulated plans to assume a greater role in matters affecting Southeast
                        Asian security. Sumitro's visit will give us another good opportunity to
                        nudge the Indonesians in the right direction. The Sumitro group will also
                        bring along a few bear traps, however, which we should keep well in view.
                        Principally among these is the Indonesian tendency to read more into what we
                        tell them than we actually intend—to translate our general comments into
                        what they consider broad and binding commitments. For this reason I would
                        like to suggest the following general precepts by which the visit might be
                        handled:</p>
                    <p>1. Indonesia's diplomatic efforts are at a particularly sensitive stage with
                        the Three Nation Committee now engaged in discussions with the Soviet Union.
                        For this and other reasons it is important that the Sumitro visit be treated
                        low key and that every effort be made to avoid publicity.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d305fn2">A notation apparently in Holdridge's handwritting next
                            to this sentence reads: “yes.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0707"/>
                    <p>2. Since Sumitro is coming here primarily to talk with you, I believe it
                        important that he get from you a full and realistic assessment of what we
                        can and cannot do to help Indonesia.<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">A notation
                            in the same handwriting next to this sentence reads: “guidelines of
                            Pres.—encourage be helpful in Cambodia.”</note> Otherwise, he will not
                        take to heart comments about budgetary limitations and other problems which
                        he may receive at <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to his talks with you, I would welcome an opportunity to talk
                        with Sumitro and suggest we also arrange a courtesy call on General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and a “working
                        level” meeting with officers in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> who have
                        detailed knowledge of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> matters and
                        possible availability of excess equipment.<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn4">A

                    </p>
                    <p>4. I suggest we tell Sumitro that we welcome the opportunity to get his
                        firsthand views and those of other key Indonesian officials, but we believe
                        that both our interests would be best served by continuing to handle
                        detailed planning in Djakarta.<note n="5" xml:id="d305fn5">A notation in the

                        reason, while we would be delighted to see General <persName
                            corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>, we would suggest that he not bring
                        any large number of experts with him but that we continue to handle details
                        of our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in Djakarta through the very
                        effective coordination already developed between HANKAM and our Defense
                        Liaison Group.</p>
                    <p>If you agree, a copy of this letter might be passed on to Dave <persName

                    <p>Indonesian General Sumitro, whom you met in Djakarta last year, is arriving
                        in Washington June 22 for the expressed purpose of seeing you and following
                        up on your conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> about U.S. arms aid to Indonesia and Indonesian
                        military assistance to Cambodia. (We will not be able to set the specific
                        time of your meeting until after he arrives.) Although State is very much
                        aware of Sumitro's visit, the arrangements have been made through the
                        special channel and not by State. Sumitro will, in fact, probably want to
                        short-circuit State (although a protocol call on Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> is in order) on the grounds that he
                        will expect to get more by dealing directly with you and Defense.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sumitro's Anticipated Position</p>
                    <p>—He will hope to obtain a firm U.S. program for Indonesia which will re-equip
                        a substantial part of the Indonesian armed forces with U.S. military
                        hardware. (He will not wish to get into specifics, since a military mission
                        under General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName> will be arriving
                        soon to discuss details.)</p>
                    <p>—He may justify the need for a <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program on
                        the grounds that the Indo-China situation poses a grave threat to the entire
                        Southeast Asian region, and that Indonesia has an important regional defense
                        role. He will probably explain that Indonesia's previous Communist sources
                        of arms are now excluded.</p>
                    <p>—He may also argue that Indonesia's needs for economic development preclude
                        picking up this burden through Indonesian resources.</p>
                    <p>—He will probably raise the matter of Indonesia's plan to send 15,000
                        Communist-pattern weapons to Cambodia. He will want immediate U.S.
                        replacement of these stocks, as a special program and not part of the
                        regular <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0709"/>
                    <p>—He will solicit your help in getting favorable action out of Defense and
                        State.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Your Recommended Position</p>
                    <p>—You recall with pleasure your talk with Sumitro and his associates last
                        summer in Djakarta. You are glad to welcome Sumitro to Washington.</p>
                    <p>—As the President told President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>, we want to be as helpful as possible in responding
                        to Indonesia's arms needs. There are of course Congressional and budgetary
                        constraints on what we can do, but within these parameters we will try to
                        work out an appropriate program. (You might wish to mention that we have
                        already more than trebled Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                        >MAP</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>—As discussed by the President and President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>, the matter of arms aid to Cambodia is urgent. You
                        hope that Indonesia can move soon on this, not only to meet the military
                        needs in Cambodia, but to give the Cambodian Government a needed
                        psychological boost. You appreciate, though, the desirability of maintaining
                        Indonesia's non-aligned image, especially while Japan, Malaysia, and
                        Indonesia are following up the Djakarta Conference.</p>
                    <p>—You might wish to ask Sumitro how these arms would be delivered, and whether
                        he thinks secrecy could be maintained. (Possibly the U.S. could render some
                        assistance in delivery, either directly or through third parties.)</p>
                    <p>—You hope that Sumitro will have useful discussions with people in the
                        Pentagon. Your staff members have been in touch with responsible people
                        there in setting up meetings. The question of our replacing stocks of
                        Indonesian arms sent to Cambodia can be discussed in them.</p>
                    <p>—You believe it would be useful, too, for Sumitro to talk with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>. All of us—those in the
                        White House, Defense, and State—want to be helpful.</p>
                    <p>—You understand that General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>
                        will be coming soon with a mission to go into details of U.S. military aid.
                        He and his group will be welcome. You anticipate that further details will
                        be worked out afterwards at Djakarta between our respective military
                        representatives.</p>
                    <p>—(<hi rend="italic">If Sumitro raises</hi>. You are glad to hear that our
                        technicians have arrived to inspect the Bandung ammunition plant, and hope
                        that conversion to handle <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss> ammunition
                        can proceed rapidly.)</p>

                        that senior officers among the Indonesian military <pb n="661"
                            xml:id="pg_661" facs="0710"/>have become sensitive over the way that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> functioned within the
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> party. (<persName
                            corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName> is only a Brigadier General.) This
                        smacks of Indonesian palace politics, of which we want no part. If the
                        matter arises, you might note that you dealt with <persName corresp="#p_AH4"
                            >Alamsjah</persName> merely as <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>'s emissary, and as a transmission-belt for carrying

                        <item>Further Points for Your Meeting with General Sumitro</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>General Sumitro arrived in Washington late yesterday, and his aides, General
                        Latief and Colonel Soekeng, got in touch with me today. General Sumitro
                        hopes for an early meeting with you, and does not want to talk with anyone
                        at State or Defense beforehand. I have not given any assurances of when the
                        meeting will be arranged, but assume that you will want to talk to him as
                        soon as it is convenient. I assume also that the party can be flown out and
                        back by Jetstar.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, a number of additional points have developed in my conversations
                        with State and Defense which you might wish to bear in mind in your
                        discussions with Sumitro:</p>
                    <p>—Defense hopes that the Indonesian offer of rifles to Cambodia can be held to
                        15,000, at least for the time being. The rationale in part is that making up
                        stocks will be difficult (M–16's would need to come from new production at
                        $150 each; M–14's are in short supply as stocks are being used to re-equip
                        the National Guard). In addition, if the Indonesians turn over all 33,000
                            <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss>'s in their possession there will
                        be no requirement in Indonesia for the <gloss target="#t_AK471"
                            >AK–47</gloss> ammunition produced by the Bandung ammunition
                        factory.</p>
                    <p>—A way can be found to replace quickly the rifles Indonesia sends to
                        Cambodia, however. Defense is thinking in terms of a loan of 15,000 <pb
                            n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0711"/>M–14's with a promise to replace
                        them later with M–16's out of the Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Military assistance funds are extremely tight due to the extra burden which
                        Cambodia has imposed. Defense is already cutting into <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for other countries to take care of
                        Cambodia, and the need to pick up Indonesia imposes yet an additional
                        burden. This is over and above the replacement of rifles, which is being
                        treated as a separate item. Defense believes it can locate funds to maintain
                        Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> at a level of $15 million as
                        already agreed, but will find it very difficult to add more. Defense hopes
                        that you can firmly but gently get this point across to Sumitro. ($15
                        million should be enough, especially if Defense is not held to $70 million
                        annually on what it can provide from U.S. excess.)</p>
                    <p>—For their part, the Indonesians probably have high hopes for much more than
                        $15 million. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wants to
                        standardize the arms of the entire Indonesian Army—which means U.S. help,
                        since he can't get anything from the Communists. There is talk in Indonesia
                        of setting up an Armalite or M–16 plant. The other services will want their
                        share, too. The Indonesians desire a firm U.S. commitment.</p>
                    <p>—There is no enthusiasm whatsoever in State and Defense for the Indonesian
                        technical mission to be headed by General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1"
                            >Umar</persName>. They feel that this mission will tend to reinforce
                        Indonesian hopes, in that it might go home with inflated ideas of what we
                        can do if technical talks actually take place. State tried to turn the
                        mission into just a protocol visit limited to <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1"
                            >Umar</persName>, his wife, and two aides. I told them that this simply
                        wouldn't wash—your talks with <persName corresp="#p_AH4">Alamsjah</persName>
                        and the President's talks with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> endorsed the technical mission concept, and that it
                        simply cannot be turned off. (You may be hearing more on this, though, from
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall Green</persName>.)</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed his regrets in
                        his delay in seeing General Sumitro; the problem was that he had to be with
                        the President so as to help prepare the President for the meet-the-press
                        session that evening. He was pleased to see General Sumitro whom he
                        remembered from the Djakarta visit last year. He also recalled the
                        conversation which he had had with General Sumitro. Had General Sumitro
                        engaged in talks with anyone else in Washington? General Sumitro replied
                        that he had wanted to see Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> first. He would, though, want to call on <persName

                        the President.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, General Sumitro explained that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had called a meeting of senior
                        Indonesian Armed Forces officers just after returning from the U.S., and had
                        gone over his conversation with the President. He had then ordered General
                        Sumitro to come to the U.S. to follow up his, <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s, talks with the President.
                        General Sumitro added that this visit, which was something of a surprise to
                        him, was made on the basis of his having become, in effect, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s counterpart in Indonesia. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if General
                        Sumitro had any special representative in Washington, and upon hearing that
                        none presently existed, ascertained that any communications by the President
                        and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> would be through
                        Sumitro in Djakarta. The special channel would be used.</p>
                    <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0713"/>
                    <p>General Sumitro then brought up Indonesia's strategic thinking, noting that
                        before <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had left for the
                        U.S. he had directed that an analysis be prepared of the current situation
                        in Southeast Asia and the Indonesian role. (There had been some changes
                        since Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had been in
                        Djakarta.) This study took into consideration the withdrawal of U.S. forces
                        from the Far East over a period of time, which the Indonesians hoped would
                        not be earlier than 1973. They also hoped that this would be a scheduled
                        process. Looking at the situation very realistically, they had come to the
                        conclusion that there should be no vacuum. At the same time, Indonesia was
                        not yet a real power, and not yet able to take over the responsibility for
                        security in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>They had then addressed the problem of the future role of Japan, on the
                        assumption that there were no other major powers with which they could
                        undertake cooperation. (They had noted that the U.S. was moving in this
                        direction also.) India could not be relied upon, although its industry was
                        growing, because of its internal political unstability. While Japan had its
                        troubles, too, its people seemed to be generally of the same opinion,
                        namely, that the major threat to Japan would come first from Red China and
                        secondly from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In 1968, when there
                        first had been regional discussions, the fact of Japanese development had
                        been recognized but also the dangers which came from that direction. The
                        Indonesians maintained the hope that the U.S. would play a role in making
                        Japan strong, and causing it to be a power able to give a sense of security
                        to Asia.</p>
                    <p>On Japan, the Indonesian position was that they did not object to seeing
                        Japan come into the region, but still had some doubts about the part which
                        Japan would play as a political and military power. Japan was unpredictable,
                        and while it had industry, logistical support, and manpower, and could
                        develop strong armed forces, there might be yet some tendencies in Japan to
                        accommodate. Two years ago, Sumitro had been told by the South Koreans that
                        the Japanese might reach an understanding with the Chinese to divide up the
                        responsibilities in the Far East between the two of them, with the Chinese
                        dominating the Asian mainland, and the offshore centers coming under
                        Japanese control. General Sumitro felt that this might be true, and that
                        there were forces in Japan which wanted to work with the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro said that the Indonesian Government, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, and the principal officers of
                        the Armed Forces had originally not intended to build up the Armed Forces
                        before 1973 because they had decided in 1965 that the first need was to
                        upgrade the Indonesian standard of living, and thus had sacrificed security
                        for the sake of the national reconstruction effort. However, this situation
                        had changed. There was the fact of the U.S. withdrawal from the Far East,
                        and the knowledge that Japan was still a questionable friend even though it
                            <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0714"/>might become a political and
                        military power. The Indonesians were also afraid that Asian centers such as
                        Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia, because of the lack of
                        military power in the region would be pressed by domestic forces to make
                        policy shifts. In this connection, General Sumitro referred to the intensity
                        of Soviet diplomacy, and expressed apprehension that the Asian governments
                        he had mentioned might lean to the Soviet side. Although the Soviets were
                        committed in the Middle East, they had influence in the region, and the
                        Asian nations might turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        counter the danger of Chinese infiltration. Speaking frankly, Indonesia had
                        to consider then becoming active in this situation.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro noted that between 1960 and 1965 Indonesia had possessed
                        strong Armed Forces, although the policies of the old regime in this period
                        had been bad. He added that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName>, who had just died, could now be forgiven, but his
                        policies would not be followed. Indonesia again needed to develop strong
                        armed forces. He and his colleagues were not worried about internal
                        disturbances, since they had been able to roll up the strong Communist
                        organization. The problem was external, and what Indonesia could do if asked
                        by others for assistance. Indonesia could send its men, but the means
                        available to them were so poor that they could not do too much. Indonesia's
                        “strategic material” was originally from the Soviets, but would be all used
                        up by 1971. What was on hand was in bad condition and could not be used in a
                        war against the Communists. Indonesia was willing to dispose of these
                        materials. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned,
                        and General Sumitro confirmed, that the Indonesians have problems with spare
                        parts for their Communist matériel.</p>
                    <p>According to General Sumitro, the Indonesians were now hoping to obtain
                        military supplies from Western Europe and from the U.S. in order to rebuild
                        their Armed Forces. They had been encouraged by the talks between the
                        President and President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>,
                        but when Admiral Sudumo had talked with <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral
                            Moorer</persName> on the Indonesian proposals, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> had said that everything had
                        depended on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s views.
                        This was the reason why <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        had asked him to give the background of the Indonesian thinking. In speeding
                        up the rebuilding of the Indonesian Armed Forces, Indonesia needed time to
                        develop since its training facilities were limited and its management very
                        bad. There was an additional principle: military development should not
                        interfere with the Indonesian five-year plan. Not one penny could be
                        expected from this plan, or it would fail.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro remarked that the Indonesians had been extremely pleased at
                        the boldness of the President's decision on Cambodia, and over the fact that
                        he had not allowed public opinion to deter him. On the basis of the
                        President's appreciation of the facts and the <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666"
                            facs="0715"/>support which he enjoys with the silent majority, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had wanted him,
                        Sumitro, to present a full conception of the Indonesian military
                        requirements. These he had with him, which would be gone into in detail
                        later by General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName> and the
                        special group which would accompany him. Another factor which the
                        Indonesians had taken into consideration was the possibility that if the
                        U.S. demobilized or reduced its military strength, there would be surplus
                        material which could be used by the Indonesians. Indonesia wouldn't ask for
                        what was still required, but only for what would no longer be needed after
                        demobilization. He would make the list of Indonesian requirements available
                        to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if General Sumitro
                        had the list with him, and was told that such was the case.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d308fn2">Not attached and not found.</note> Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he had no idea as to
                        how this matter could be implemented, but wanted to say a number of things.
                        We had a tough legislative problem, and there were also some divisions in
                        the Government on the issue of military aid to Indonesia along the same
                        departmental lines as existed in Indonesia. We had learned of Indonesian
                        divisions from various sources. All these things posed a difficult problem,
                        although he felt that we both understood the problems which existed in our
                        respective Capitals.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he wanted to
                        make one point plain—the strategic picture which we had in mind was not of
                        withdrawal, but of a reduction. The President agreed with the Indonesian
                        position, and had expressed this to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, whose visit he had very much
                        welcomed. Anything which required legislation or money needed to wait until
                        after the November elections. If these went badly there might be
                        difficulties. General Sumitro expressed the hope that the elections would go
                        very well. He observed, too, that he had convinced the Indonesian Ambassador
                        in Washington on the need for what Indonesia was doing.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked how long General
                        Sumitro had been in Washington. He was worried about the time factor. If
                        this was no problem, he would suggest that the best procedure would be for
                        him to study the Indonesian paper, and for General Sumitro to see <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName>, in whom he had full
                        confidence. He would speak to <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral
                            Moorer</persName> beforehand. Because the President was so preoccupied
                        with Cambodia, not much could be done that day, but he would be back in
                        Washington on Monday. He would study the plan, would talk about it with the
                        President, and meet again with General Sumitro on Monday or Tuesday. No one
                        but <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> and Mr. Holdridge
                        would know of this matter. Possibly something could be worked out in
                        principle, <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0716"/>and he was sympathetic
                        to the idea of providing surplus matériel. There was a problem, though, that
                        if our help became too obvious, then Congressional restrictions might be
                        imposed. The Congress would zero in if the program were too obvious. As for
                        the elections, we didn't need to defeat all the Senators, but if three or
                        four were defeated the others would get the message. Meanwhile, we could use
                        the time between now and the Fall to do what could be done in developing a
                        program. The Indonesian theory was fully consistent with the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. We would need to study the
                        paper and transfer it into specifics. He would want to talk with General
                        Sumitro again, and with the President in some detail so that proper guidance
                        could be provided. An immediate way to be helpful might be on the matter of
                        the Indonesian offer to send rifles to Cambodia. If these were replaced with
                        some U.S. rifles, the program of re-equipping the Indonesian Armed Forces
                        would already be beginning.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of the rifles for Cambodia, General Sumitro felt that it would
                        be better to wait for the visit of General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1"
                            >Umar</persName> to work out the technical details. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had told him not to get into
                        details. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> assured him
                        that we would think the whole thing over. He could only say that the
                        President had been very pleased over his conversation with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, and believed he had
                        reached an understanding with him. He wanted to do what he could to help
                        Indonesia develop. The problem was one of finding measures to do so which
                        would be within our political capability. As to the visit by General
                            <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>, it might be a good idea to
                        hold this matter in abeyance and to talk about it further next week. General
                        Sumitro indicated that General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>
                        would not leave until after his own return to Djakarta, so that holding off
                        for a while would be no problem.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro asked if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        had any questions concerning Indonesian strategic thinking. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered about the magnitude of
                        the development program, the size of the Indonesian Armed Forces, and the
                        scale of re-equipment. He would get a better feel of this from the paper. On
                        the Indonesian strategic appreciation, he recapitulated this as: <hi
                            rend="italic">first</hi>, accepting the importance of having the Asian
                        centers play a larger role if the U.S. presence was reduced (we didn't like
                        to talk about “withdrawals”); <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, having Japan
                        play a larger role but with its forces coming in only if a threat developed
                        and not before; third, regarding Indonesia as another component in the
                        strategic situation in which Malaysia, the Philippines, etc., tended to look
                        to the largest country for security; <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi>, seeing
                        India as not being in a position to fulfill this responsibility; and <hi
                            rend="italic">finally</hi>, reasoning that the Indonesian Armed Forces
                        needed to be re-equipped to some extent to fit into our reduction, using
                        equipment of common origin. This meant replacement of matériel from Western
                        Europe and U.S. sources. The Indonesians also were aware of the U.S.
                        legislative restrictions, <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0717"/>and were
                        thinking of surplus equipment after U.S. forces were drawn down.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he would ask
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> to translate the
                        Indonesian request into dollars, and would try to keep this matter as
                        restricted as possible. We would need some idea as to what was really
                        involved. At the same time, the President had the warmest attitude toward
                        Indonesia, appreciated its constructive attitude, and regarded the
                        Indonesians as friends. Could he assume that General Sumitro spoke for
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>? General
                        Sumitro replied that his position had been mentioned during the meeting of
                        the two Presidents and reiterated before the Indonesian military leaders.
                        General Latif, who had been in both meetings, could verify this. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we would
                        communicate with General Sumitro via our man in Djakarta. If we received
                        confusing reports, we would check with him, and it would be helpful to
                        receive information as to what President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> thought. Similarly, if they received confusing
                        reports from our Ambassador, they should check with us. He would provide
                        exact information. Was there any other matter which General Sumitro wanted
                        to discuss? He did not object to the Indonesian list, but did not want it to
                        become an official proposal. It was agreed that one copy would be provided
                        to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff and one to <persName

                        meet again with Sumitro and did so at 5:00 p.m. last night. Sumitro was told
                        by <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0718"/>Holdridge to provide <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> with a list of Indonesia's
                        requirements; however, he refused to do so and when he was pressed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> he stated that his
                        instructions provided that he had to give the list to you alone. All of the
                        instructions which you gave to David were carried out, and Holdridge spoke
                        to Sumitro yesterday morning on the subject but apparently to no avail.</p>
                    <p>During the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral
                            Moorer</persName>, Sumitro made the following points:</p>
                    <p>—Indonesia is prepared to furnish up to 25,000 <gloss target="#t_AK471"
                            >AK–47</gloss>'s to Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>—Indonesia is also prepared to train Cambodian forces either in Indonesia or
                        in Cambodia. Sumitro estimates it would take three months to develop an
                        effective soldier and six months to train highly qualified troops.</p>
                    <p>—Sumitro is very anxious to actively participate in Cambodia's anti-Communist
                        efforts. He suggested to <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral
                            Moorer</persName> that the U.S. should completely replace all Soviet
                        equipment in Indonesia and should also provide the amphibious or airlift for
                        at least a brigade of Indonesian troops so that their power could be
                        projected into trouble-spots.</p>
                    <p>—Sumitro estimated that the major threat comes from Communist China which
                        could move through Burma or Thailand.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> got the impression
                        that there would be no difficulty in getting the Indonesians to help
                        provided their quid pro quo was met. The quid pro quo, in <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName>'s estimation, undoubtedly
                        will be extremely large, however.</p>
                    <p>John Holdridge is completing detailed talking points for your use at tomorrow
                        night's meeting with Sumitro and will have them to you before the close of

                        studied the Indonesian proposal for U.S. military assistance. In addition,
                        he had just had a long talk with the President about the situation.<note

                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> from 4:17 to 5:10 p.m.

                            Presidential Materials, White House Central Files)</note> He had given
                        the President a full account of the discussions in Los Angeles, and had told
                        the President about the Indonesian defense philosophy if U.S. forces were
                        reduced, i.e. others would need to step in, and Indonesia as the largest
                        country in Southeast Asia would want to play a bigger role as its forces
                        were modernized. The President had agreed. The problem now was one of how to
                        put the Indonesian philosophy into effect. The full Indonesian list was very
                        substantial; for example, B–52s did not appear to be the most immediate
                        necessity. General Sumitro remarked that as he had explained to <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName>, the plan for modernizing
                        the Indonesian forces was divided into phases.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that the problem
                        with the total list was that it was so comprehensive we found it hard to
                        make a reasonable proposition. We would like, first, to build upon the $15
                        million Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. Although there were
                        some here who said that the emphasis in <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671"
                            facs="0720"/>the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> should be put on
                        civil construction, we recognized that this did not serve the purpose of
                        modernization, and so would undertake a review. Second, we would look over
                        our surplus equipment in Asia to see how much we could give. Third, we had
                        established good success in our Government in making studies of problems
                        such as this in terms of program analysis of requirements, and with their
                        approval would like to do this for them to see how we could develop a
                        reasonable program within our capabilities. We couldn't reach agreement on
                        the full list right away, and needed a program; we also wanted to look at
                        what we could get from surpluses. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> assumed that the Indonesians could get such civil
                        assistance items as road building equipment elsewhere, and that there would
                        be no objection to a reordering of the Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro said that he had discussed this with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, who had indicated that if the
                        U.S. was in basic agreement, the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program
                        would be dropped and included in the new requirement list. They hoped that
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> could be transferred into their
                        overall requirements. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        expressed the view that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> should be
                        continued; in fact, he had asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1"
                            >Lynn</persName> to see what could be obtained from <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> alone if it were concentrated on weapons.
                        There was no need to go into details now, but a good deal might be obtained.
                        (He read from an illustrative list.) We wanted, too, to look at surpluses.
                        He had talked with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> on
                        the possibility of increasing the Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>, and would attempt to do so, but we needed to get some idea
                        of their needs in terms of realistic possibilities. We would look at their
                        plan through Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName>,<note n="4"

                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s, and that it would cost “billions of
                            dollars.” <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName> proposed instead
                            “to give them assistance which contributes to the priority mission of
                            maintaining internal security,” including 18 T–37 aircraft, 20 C–47
                            aircraft, 10 patrol craft, 12 light landing craft, and initial equipment
                            for 9 infantry battalions, which he estimated would cost $75 million
                            over 5 years. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, Box
                            531, Country Files, Far East, Indonesia, Vol. II)</note> and we would
                        look at surpluses.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that until all
                        of these requirements had been completed, it might be better for General
                            <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName> not to come. We did not
                        want this matter to become too bureaucratized. If it were kept low, the
                        Indonesians could be sure of the President's personal attention. General
                        Sumitro agreed, observing that it would be much better if General <persName
                            corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName> could wait. In the meantime, a study
                        could be made in Indonesia, which he felt might require about two months.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought that the time
                        required might not be more than two weeks, since Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName> had done superior work before in this
                        sort of <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0721"/>analysis and could organize
                        a study team quickly. This would be a good survey, which would provide us
                        with a basis for joint action.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro noted in response to a question from Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that he was planning on returning
                        to Djakarta on July 9. Upon his return, consideration would be given to what
                        the Indonesia Five-Year Military Plan should be. There was as yet no idea as
                        to magnitudes. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        suggested that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName> might be
                        able to help in this respect. General Sumitro speculated that it might be
                        possible to talk in terms of percentages of their total requirements list,
                        perhaps 10–15 percent for a start. The officer in charge of laying out these
                        requirements was just finishing up a seminar in the U.S. and was on his way
                        to Djakarta.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked how we might
                        maintain communications, to which General Sumitro replied he favored using
                        the same special channel which now existed. In a month or two, he would have
                        a military man in Washington who could act as a contact. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also raised the problem of
                        maintaining security on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName>'s
                        presence in Indonesia. On this, General Sumitro proposed that the study be
                        made in Bali, which could be reached by direct flight to Bangkok. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that he would
                        give further thought to this question, and would be in touch. Would they
                        mind if our Ambassador knew of the study? General Sumitro replied that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> felt Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> could be relied upon.
                        He was, however, subordinate to the State Department. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> assured General Sumitro that we
                        would keep this whole thing under tight control, and would look into the
                        bureaucratic aspects.</p>
                    <p>On the question of obtaining a visa for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1"
                            >Lynn</persName>, General Sumitro felt that this was no problem. The
                        Indonesian Military Attaché could set it up, or it could be obtained
                        somewhere else such as the Indonesian Embassy in Bangkok (their Ambassador
                        there was a General) or in Tokyo. General Latif observed that in the
                        President's conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> the President had given assurances that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> would be kept fully
                        informed. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, but
                        pointed out that the communications channel posed a problem. It would be
                        difficult if we had to go through the regular channel. However, what we told
                        our Ambassador would be our worry. Did Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> know that General Sumitro was
                        here? General Sumitro noted in reply that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> had been kept informed of his,
                        Sumitro's, visit by the Indonesian Foreign Minister. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that we would keep
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> informed on
                        essential matters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that we would
                        start now to work out the composition of the study, and the communications
                        channels. Our requirement would be to get some sense of the magnitude of the
                        quantities, <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0722"/>and to know what we
                        could realistically do. He emphasized that the President was in favor of
                        helping. What the Indonesians had presented was a maximum program, but we
                        needed to be realistic. Had the Indonesian plan been given to <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName>? General Sumitro said that
                        it had not yet been given to <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral
                            Moorer</persName>, since they didn't regard it as a formal document.
                        However, they would be glad to pass the plan on to <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> if Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought that this would be
                        desirable. It was agreed that Colonel Soegeng would give it to Mr. Holdridge
                        for transmittal to <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral
                        Moorer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> raised the issue of the
                        Indonesian offer to provide <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss>s to
                        Cambodia. General Sumitro said that Indonesia had 25,000 on hand which they
                        were willing to offer as soon as they heard from Phnom Penh and as soon as
                        U.S. replacement rifles arrived in Djakarta. They understood that the total
                        Cambodian requirements were for 30,000 small arms. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> informed General Sumitro that we
                        would be willing to send 15,000 M–14s immediately, on loan, and replace
                        these with M–16s under the Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.
                        General Sumitro remarked that of the types of weapons available—the M–14,
                        the AR–15, and the modified M–16—the modified M–16 was much the best. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated that our
                        proposal was to give M–14s now and replace them with M–16s as production
                        became available.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro raised another question: the re-equipping of the Indonesian
                        State Police, for which they had also forwarded requirements. He pointed out
                        that the Police were a part of the Indonesian defense establishment. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName> indicated that this question, too,
                        would be considered in the study.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then telephoned
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> to ask about the
                        time which would be required to provide M–16s under the Indonesian <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. He quoted <persName corresp="#p_MTH1"
                            >Admiral Moorer</persName> as saying that the M–16s would be provided
                        within a year or even less, and that the M–14s would thus be on hand for a
                        relatively short period. These M–14s would be in good condition, since they
                        were being held in reserve for the U.S. forces.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro referred to the fact that the Indonesians had an arms factory
                        capable of producing a machine gun known as the BM–59. This was a stop-gap
                        weapon, which did not compare with the M–16. Was it correct that the U.S.
                        had given an arms factory to Singapore for manufacturing M–16s? Mr.
                        Holdridge said that he thought this was still under discussion, and had not
                        yet been decided. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LLEJ1">Lynn</persName> asked if
                        their existing factory could be converted to manufacture modern weapons, to
                        which General Sumitro expressed uncertainties as to the technical nature of
                        the problem. Again, the M–16 was better than anything else. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained that we were in
                        principle prepared to provide M–16s and would do so as soon as production
                        caught up. We were in fact cutting back on production for our forces.</p>
                    <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0723"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered how <gloss
                            target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss> deliveries to Cambodia could be worked
                        out. General Sumitro responded by saying that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wanted the Cambodians to take
                        over this responsibility and transfer the weapons to Phnom Penh themselves.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that this was
                        satisfactory, and that the Indonesians should let us know when the transfer
                        had been completed so we could provide replacement weapons. General Sumitro
                        then said that the Indonesians wanted the U.S. rifles first, to which Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we should
                        start doing this and would take it up in the next <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                            >WSAG</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> touched on the question
                        of Bandung ammunition factory, asking about its status. General Sumitro
                        noted that the money was available in Indonesia to start building a new
                        plant for <gloss target="#t_AK471">AK–47</gloss> ammunition, and that nine
                        months would be required for the first production. They still had ammunition
                        reserves, but had pulled it all back to Djakarta and had re-equipped their
                        commando and parachute brigades.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro again brought up the question of the National Police,
                        explaining that the Police would need to take over internal security
                        responsibilities from the other services so that these services could
                        concentrate on the national defense effort. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> thought that our program would take care of most
                        essentials.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro went over Indonesian strategic concepts in the same terms
                        which he had outlined in Los Angeles. Once again he expressed reservations
                        about the role of Japan in Southeast Asia, pointing out that the Japanese
                        military leaders properly understood the threat Communist China posed for
                        Japan but that the Japanese politicians in contrast wanted to avoid a
                        conflict with China and might accommodate. In fact, Japan's approach to the
                        other Asian countries might even constitute an economic and political threat
                        if things were to go wrong. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> asked what could go wrong, General Sumitro pointed
                        once more to the possibility of a Japanese accommodation with Communist
                        China. He hoped that the U.S. would be successful in influencing the
                        Japanese to follow the proper line, but he was not so sure about this— he
                        had the impression that the Japanese politicians were stubborn. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> recalled that when he
                        had been in Indonesia last year he had encountered disquiet over the future
                        role of Japan.</p>
                    <p>The conversation concluded with a reaffirmation from Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that the President had wanted
                        very positively to respond to the Indonesian proposals and had asked that
                        his warmest feelings be conveyed to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. He considered his relationship
                        with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> as one of
                        the warmest he possessed. We had certain restraints on what we can do, but
                        within these limitations we would act. We recognized the Indonesian role,
                        which was precisely what the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine required. General Sumitro should feel free to write on any subject
                        and to keep in close contact.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName>Henry</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I have received a personal letter from Frank Galbraith covering a range of
                        sensitive subjects regarding our relations with Indonesia. I thought you
                        would be particularly interested in the following excerpts on Indonesian
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. <persName>Frank</persName>
                        presented these points as the views of the small circle in the Embassy who
                        work on highly sensitive political/ <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>,

                            source text not declassified</hi>]).</p>
                    <p>“What we are most anxious to see amplified is the timetable which the
                        President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> have in
                        mind for the Indonesian program. We are all agreed, as I believe you are in
                        Washington, that Indonesia's present capability for assuming a meaningful
                        security role in Southeast Asia is virtually nonexistent. A great deal of
                        basic spadework needs to be done, both in stabilizing and developing the
                        country as well as preparing the military establishment for modernization.
                        The review of emphasis in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> which Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned to Sumitro
                        has to a large degree already taken place. Although civic action continues
                        to play an important role in the program, the planning under the new $15
                        million ceiling places primary emphasis on improving the maintenance
                        capability, logistics, and communications of the military, along with the
                        introduction of some combat equipment. All of these elements are, of course,
                        a necessary preamble to a modernization program.</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s reaction, as
                        reported by General Sumitro to George Benson (Djakarta 5655)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d311fn2">Dated August 4. (Ibid.)</note> fortunately seems to
                        recognize the need for a measured approach. He seems to be sufficiently
                        concerned with the budget and Indonesia's economic development to want to
                        postpone any further burgeoning <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for this
                        year at least.</p>
                    <p>“There are a number of pitfalls which both we and the Indonesians will have
                        to avoid if we want a realistic chance for a stable Indonesia capable of
                        playing the role we envisage for it in the area. <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676"
                            facs="0725"/>Shifting too quickly into a full-fledged modernization
                        program, either because of our interest in forcing the pace of Indonesia's
                        military progress, or because of the inability of the Indonesians to resist
                        the temptations, would present us with one of two choices. Either one of
                        these, I believe, would be undesirable at this stage. The first would be to
                        turn over a lot of modern equipment too soon and watch it become quickly
                        unserviceable; the other would be to provide hundreds of American trainers
                        and advisers so that we could insist and insure that they take care of the
                        equipment. If we were to adopt the second choice I am afraid that we would
                        be adding significantly to the domestic political problems which are likely
                        to mount for the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        Government anyway. Many of those in the Indonesian Armed Forces are all too
                        inclined to ignore the political repercussions of actions which they
                        consider desirable from a purely military point of view. If we compound
                        their lack of political sophistication by ourselves ignoring such probable
                        political repercussions, we are likely to increase their political troubles
                        and eventually weaken the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>“Another area where a premature military modernization effort would weaken
                        hopes for a stable base from which Indonesia could mount its heightened
                            <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> role is on the economic side. It
                        would be a tragedy should the Indonesians divert too soon their scarce
                        resources from development into the military sector, a diversion which would
                        be required if they were to seek to absorb more <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>, given the huge rupiah outlay required to receive, use and
                        maintain the equipment we might give them. Progress on the economic side has
                        been promising, but the situation remains critical. Such a diversion at this
                        stage of the first five-year program could seriously set back the good start
                        that has been made in economic rehabilitation.”</p>
                    <p>My personal experiences in Indonesia would support
                        <persName>Frank</persName>'s assessment.</p>

                            Regional Military Cooperation</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>At Tab B<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">The September 25 message is attached but
                            not printed.</note> is a message to you from General Sumitro requesting
                        U.S. assistance to Indonesia in furthering Southeast Asian regional military
                        cooperation. He proposes that Indonesia take the initiative in arranging
                        for: (1) exchanges of personnel for training; (2) strategic intelligence
                        operations; (3) holding seminars of senior commanders on defense,
                        intelligence and territorial warfare operations; and (4) ultimately,
                        participation in joint military operations in border areas.</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro's thesis is that the British “East of Suez” policy and the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine create a military
                        vacuum into which the Communists (particularly Communist China) will try to
                        move via protracted wars of national liberation, and that the free nations
                        of the region thus have enough in common to be able to coordinate on foreign
                        policy and defense matters if someone shows the way. This could lead to a
                        military “gentleman's agreement,” and not necessarily to a formal military
                        pact.</p>
                    <p>The initial costs to the U.S., as laid out by General Sumitro, would amount
                        to a rounded-off figure of $1 million spent between 1970 and 1972 on
                        conducting an educational program in joint strategic intelligence, a senior
                        seminar, an Indonesian advisory and military training program in Cambodia,
                        and a language training program. To provide for transportation of the
                        personnel involved, Indonesia would like the loan of six C–130s, or if this
                        is not possible, the use of U.S. aircraft as needed on an “on-call” basis.
                        Typically, General Sumitro insists that there be no impairment of
                        Indonesia's five-year plan by diverting funds from it.</p>
                    <p>As a final pitch, General Sumitro strongly urges that the U.S. set up an M–16
                        factory in Indonesia to bring about the standardization of weapons among all
                        the free Southeast Asian nations. He suggests that <pb n="678"
                            xml:id="pg_678" facs="0727"/>the ammunition which Indonesia has sent to
                        Cambodia be applied as a partial payment for the M–16 plant.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>General Sumitro's proposal contains some intriguing aspects. We are
                        interested in the development of regional security undertakings, and the
                        Indonesians might well be the best ones to take the lead in this. The rather
                        modest nature of their initial program would probably assure a good
                        response, since there would be no implications of a formal security
                        organization. The proposal might also be a means for getting Indonesia to
                        move toward a security role of its own in troubled areas of Southeast Asia.
                        The costs involved are also relatively modest.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we should recognize that Indonesia is not acting out of
                        sheer altruism. A bid for six C–130s has been made to us earlier in
                        connection with the shipment of ammunition to Cambodia, which we deflected
                        by using U.S. aircraft, while a request for an M–16 factory has been made on
                        several occasions, most recently during General Sumitro's conversation with
                        you in July. It has been reiterated through regular State channels, also as
                        part of a deal on the ammunition which they sent to Cambodia, and will
                        probably come up again when <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> sees the President. It is clear that they want the
                        airplanes and the plant very badly, and may have used their regional
                        cooperation proposal in part as the means to this particular end (or ends).
                        They are also working their aid to Cambodia into the regional security
                        framework, of course at our expense.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, as <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> put it,
                        a single spark can start a prairie fire. As of now there is no movement at
                        all toward a regional security arrangement in Southeast Asia, and the
                        Indonesians might just be able to get things going. At Tab A is a draft
                        reply from you to General Sumitro, which while not assuming any commitment
                        expresses interest in his proposal and suggests that he should submit it
                        through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> so as to

                        Cambodia is acceptable, i.e. providing them with $262,000 in cash and with

                        requested. In this respect, I believe that it would be useful to weigh into
                        the balance any political factors which might affect our judgment one way or
                        the other. I would in addition like more details on the aid which we might
                        offer in connection with the Bandung ammunition factory or the Husien Air
                        Base Depot, specifically whether our assistance would be of an order of
                        magnitude which would make these projects acceptable alternatives to an M–16
                        factory.</p>

                        State/Defense message to Djakarta which you attached to your memorandum to

                        group will therefore be different than originally anticipated. However, any
                        group which goes to Indonesia will be regarded as doing so under your
                        direction and hence will be acceptable to the Indonesians.</p>
                    <p>A problem which now must be addressed is getting a suitable group organized.
                        We believe that it would be desirable to send a small party so as to keep
                        the visibility down, and to include one representative each from the Army,
                        Navy, and Air Force, a logistics specialist and a representative of the
                        Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in State. A <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681"
                            facs="0730"/>representative of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                            >CINCPAC</gloss> also should join the team for its Indonesian visit (he
                        would pave the way for problem solving both with <gloss target="#t_PACOM1"
                            >PACOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>). The team
                        chief preferably should be designated by the Joint Staff or <gloss
                            target="#t_DODISA1">DOD/ISA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>There is also a problem on how to initiate this project. No one other than
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Admiral Moorer</persName> is aware of the
                        five-year improvement plan given you by the Indonesians. We suggest a
                        game-plan which would involve your engaging in discussions with Under
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MTH1"
                            >Admiral Moorer</persName>. Your luncheon on November 20 with Under
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> would provide the opportunity to
                        raise this with both of them, leaving only <persName corresp="#p_MTH1"
                            >Admiral Moorer</persName> to be brought in. You could point out
                        that:</p>
                    <p>—The Indonesians have been pressing to send a high-level mission to
                        Washington under General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>, their
                        Army Chief of Staff, to determine possible levels of U.S. military
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>—Indonesian expectations are very high, and we, Defense, and State (the East
                        Asian Bureau) agree that it would be inadvisable for General <persName
                            corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar</persName>'s mission to come until we have a
                        better feel for what they really need and what we can do. Otherwise, the
                        Indonesians either would see our willingness to receive them as a sign that
                        they can expect a great deal from us, or we would be placed in the position
                        of turning them down.</p>
                    <p>—We do not want to leave the impression with the Indonesian military that we
                        will not be helpful. The President, in fact, wants us to do what we can
                        within the limits of available resources and has authorized an increase in
                        the Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> from around $4.5 million
                        to $18 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 (including $3
                        million to reimburse the Indonesians for their aid to Cambodia). The
                        intention is to use surplus stocks as much as possible. The Indonesian
                        military are a very important factor in the country's stability, and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wants to be
                        able to meet their desires for new equipment to the greatest extent
                        possible. A negative attitude on our part could seriously impair what is now
                        a cordial U.S.-Indonesia relationship.</p>
                    <p>—At the same time, we do not wish to lend any substance to the high
                        Indonesian expectations. We want to keep the whole question of military
                        assistance to Indonesia under control and not let the Indonesians set the
                        pace.</p>
                    <p>—Accordingly, you suggest that a special survey group on U.S. military
                        assistance to Indonesia be sent out to go into Indonesian requirements and
                        to see what we might be able to provide, particularly from surplus stocks in
                        Vietnam. This group would plan on spending several weeks in Indonesia, and
                        would also go to Vietnam to inquire into the surplus situation there. In
                        this way we could hold off General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1"
                            >Umar</persName>'s mission, and keep the initiative in our hands.</p>
                    <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0731"/>
                    <p>—You suggest that the survey group be composed of representatives of the
                        three Armed Services, a logistician, a <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                            >CINCPAC</gloss> representative, and a representative of the Bureau of
                        Politico-Military Affairs in State. It would be headed by a military officer
                        to be designated by the Joint Staff, or by someone of appropriate rank from
                            <gloss target="#t_OASDISA1">OASD/ISA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—We would want to keep the existence of the survey group very closely held.
                        Its members would be picked very carefully and briefed thoroughly on the
                        political sensitivities involved and on the need to stay out of the public
                        eye while in Indonesia.</p>

                    <p>1. We have had some pretty good indications last few days that contrary some
                        previous reports debate is still going on within Indonesian Government over
                        question of seeking Soviet assistance for rehabilitation of Soviet military
                        equipment (or has been reopened as a result of a new and presumably more
                        attractive Soviet offer). My hunch is that foreign office plus certain
                        elements in military concerned both with Indonesian nonaligned image and
                        with importance of Soviet <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0732"/>equipment
                        in air and navy (and this does not include apparently chiefs of staff of

                        also received indication from member of staff of Chief of Air Force Suwoto
                        that Soviet Ambassador has in last few days given President <persName

                        Soviet military assistance. I have agreed to meet informally and privately
                        with Chief of Staff of Air Suwoto this coming Monday evening at his request
                        to discuss this matter, his purpose apparently being to seek my reaction and
                        to enlist my efforts to emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"

                        Ministry, Djajadiningrat, yesterday I was asked whether I didn't agree that
                        Indonesia should seek support from Soviets for rehabilitation Soviet
                        military equipment. I said this was decision for <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> but that from my point of view if price was right and

                    <p>1. Before meeting mentioned para 1 ref A took place last night we learned
                        that Chief of Staff of Air Suwoto was having cold feet about discussing
                        alleged Soviet offers of military assistance with me. Nevertheless Suwoto
                        and his chief of operations (Air Vice Marshal Slamat, who had served as
                        intermediary) showed up at house of one of DLG staff and after some
                        awkwardness about opening up subject (I eventually took initiative) Suwoto
                        talked briefly and in very general terms about “probability” that Soviets
                        will make attractive offer of military assistance to Indonesia. Suwoto said
                        it is apparent to him that Soviets want to establish themselves in Southeast
                        Asia in order to out-flank Communist China and that strenuous efforts they
                        are making in this regard elsewhere in area is indication they will make
                        attractive offer of military assistance to Indonesia. Suwoto said he does
                        not want his air force split into two sections, one supplied by Soviet and
                        one by U.S. (implying he is not in favor of accepting Soviet assistance) but
                        he also implied that unless U.S. moves faster with its assistance for close
                        air and other support for Indonesian air force he may be forced to take
                        Soviet assistance.</p>
                    <p>2. I questioned Suwoto as closely as I could on whether Soviets had already
                        made an offer or indicated in any concrete way that they are prepared to
                        discuss the matter further. He maintained that this was all still in the
                        conditional and the realm of possibility.</p>
                    <p>3. Air Marshal Slamat had also indicated previously that Suwoto would press
                        me on possible procurement of excess B–25 aircraft. Suwoto did not do so
                        although he queried me in general terms about availability of excess
                        material in Vietnam. He also questioned me in general terms about future of
                        U.S. military assistance to Indonesia. I replied in equally general terms
                        that it was possible that there would be some excess equipment in Vietnam
                        available that would be useful to Indonesia although we had not thus far
                        been able to locate much within context our <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>. With respect to future U.S. military assistance I only
                        said that Congress was watching this very carefully but that I felt sure we
                        would do our fair share to help countries which showed that they could help
                        themselves.</p>

                        Our best guess is that although <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>,
                        particularly army, has decided against accepting Soviet assistance and
                        number of Soviet personnel which go with it, there are those among the armed
                        services and, of course, in foreign office who believe that offer of credit
                        terms which <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> brought back from
                        Moscow for purchase of spare parts for military equipment should be taken
                        up. The Soviets may be seeking to reopen the debate within the military over
                        accepting Soviet spare parts (and incidentally embarrass the U.S. since they
                        undoubtedly aware of our tardiness in delivering promised air force items)
                        by a specific and presumably more attractive offer. Whatever Suwoto's
                        motives in approaching me, he obviously backed away at last moment possibly
                        at insistence of Hankam.</p>

                    <p>The $640 million Indonesian aid requirement was calculated by the World Bank,
                        which coordinates the major non-Communist aid donors through the
                        Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_IGGI1"
                        >IGGI</gloss>). </p>
                    <p>The U.S. pledge of $215 million will consist of $90 million in food aid and
                        $125 million of non-food aid. Both pledges are consistent with the formula
                        used last year, that the United States provide a “fair share” of food and
                        one-third of bilateral non-food aid. It would, however, represent a slight
                        decline from our $230 million contribution this year.</p>
                    <p>Foreign aid has played a key role in stabilizing the Indonesian economy
                        following the disastrous policies of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName>. The rate of inflation in 1970 has been less than 7
                        percent, compared with 600 percent in 1966. An increase in food
                        availability, particularly rice, is the key to the success of the
                        stabilization program. A sound rice policy has been instituted under which
                        domestic procurement of rice by the Government has more than doubled over
                        last year, helping assure an incentive price for farmers while eliminating
                        seasonal fluctuations in urban rice prices.</p>
                    <p>In April 1970, basic reforms were introduced to simplify the foreign exchange
                        system; exports thereby increased in the first ten months of 1970 by about
                        15 percent, despite falling prices for rubber and tin. Imports are being
                        focused on high priority sectors. Indonesia's net foreign exchange position
                        has improved, and foreign investment continues to be attracted to priority
                        sectors. An international formula for rescheduling Indonesian debt has been
                        worked out, and we expect to sign a bilateral agreement which will allow
                        Indonesia to reschedule its debts to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The problems facing Indonesia are still severe: generating long-term economic
                        growth is difficult in view of the weak economic base; corruption continues
                        to be a major problem; and the country's lack of a strong administrative
                        capacity impairs even the most carefully conceived development plans.</p>
                    <p>However, President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, with
                        the assistance of the World Bank and the U.S., is sincerely trying to

                    </p>
                    <p>Indonesian military leaders appear determined to draw from us within the very
                        near future a reaction to their proposal to assume regional security
                        responsibilities as well as a more precise indication of the military
                        support we will be giving them over the next five years.</p>
                    <p>They have not provided us and perhaps have not yet formulated a clear picture
                        of Indonesia's prospective security role in the region. They seem to
                        envisage as a first step, however, an in-country training program for other
                        Southeast Asian troops as well as the stationing of Indonesian advisors in
                        Cambodia and perhaps other forward areas. By the end of the “Five Year
                        Plan,” they might well hope to equip a modern, mobile strike force to stand
                        by for possible deployment on the mainland.</p>
                    <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0737"/>
                    <p>We believe that we must at this point provide as unequivocal a response as
                        possible to this Indonesian démarche if we are to place our future relations
                        on a sound basis and avoid leading the Indonesians into potentially harmful
                        miscalculations. In formulating our response, we should bear in mind that it
                        is in the Indonesian nature to expect more than is usually possible and to
                        request more than is really expected.</p>
                    <p>The enclosed paper discusses the current Indonesian probe and evaluates
                        alternative U.S. responses. Following are our views on the approach we
                        should take with the Indonesians:</p>
                    <p>We should discourage the Indonesians from thinking that we will underwrite a
                        regional security role for them over the next five years:</p>
                    <p>—Even should funds for such a program be available, we cannot promote
                        Indonesia into a role to which it must be elected by its neighbors. Indeed,
                        efforts to do so would probably be counterproductive as other nations would
                        resent Indonesia's serving as a middleman for U.S. military assistance.</p>
                    <p>—More compelling, some of Indonesia's neighbors might well view an Indonesian
                        external defense capability as a threat rather than a contribution to their
                        own security.</p>
                    <p>—Finally and most important, Indonesia's assumption of regional security
                        responsibilities before it has developed necessary management, logistical
                        and operational capabilities will only delay efforts to lay an indigenous
                        base for a more effective defense establishment.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we should be as positive and forthcoming as possible in
                        helping Indonesia over the next five years to build an indigenous logistical
                        base which would permit it to play a role in the area commensurate with its
                        size, population and economic potential. This approach is discussed under
                        Section V B of the attached paper. It would involve supplying light combat
                        items wanted and required by Indonesia for helping to meet its internal
                        security needs as well as continued concentration on improving Indonesia's
                        maintenance, transport and communications capabilities. In addition we might
                        afford assistance in building up defense-related industries. If a suitable
                        program can be worked out, we should consider increasing the currently
                        planned <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972–76 annual <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> levels of $15 million ($13 million funded
                        and $2 million excess) over the next few years to permit support for a
                        defense-related industry (estimated at approximately $2 to $3 million per
                        year).</p>
                    <p>We strongly recommend informing the Indonesians of the approximate levels of
                        both funded and long supply/excess support they can expect to receive under
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for the next year or two, subject to
                        Congressional appropriations. Failure to do so could well lead to
                        exaggerated expectations and thus future misunderstandings. In this respect

                        group could also look quietly into the question of increasing LS/<gloss

                        our response to this Indonesian initiative before entering into these
                        discussions in Djakarta, which might best be timed for late January or early

                        SUPPORT OF A FIVE YEAR MILITARY PLAN</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Problem</p>
                    <p>The Indonesian military leaders have reportedly approved a “Five Year
                        Military Plan” which projects a regional security role for the Indonesian
                        Armed Forces. They have urgently pressed for high level, bilateral meetings
                        to sound out U.S. reaction to this plan, which would apparently rely on
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support.</p>
                    <p>We have as yet obtained only a very sketchy outline of the Indonesian plan
                        and it is possible that the Indonesians wish to probe the degree of U.S.
                        support for this general concept before developing further their ideas. As a
                        first step, they apparently envisage a large in-country training program for
                        Malaysian, Thai, Laotian, Cambodian and perhaps other Southeast Asian troops
                        and the establishment of regular channels for the exchange of military
                        intelligence. (This would in fact be expansion of arrangements Indonesia has
                        already established on a bilateral basis with certain countries.) The
                        Indonesians also have spoken of stationing Indonesian territorial warfare
                        advisors in Cambodia and may envisage a regional advisory effort.</p>
                    <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0739"/>
                    <p>Towards the end of the Five Year Plan, the Indonesians probably wish to
                        establish and equip a modern, mobile land force for possible deployment to
                        the mainland, a navy strike force consisting of destroyers, submarines and
                        attack transports and an enlarged Air Force transport arm. In addition, the
                        Indonesians have clearly indicated their willingness to provide troops for a
                        peacekeeping role in Viet-Nam under certain political conditions.</p>
                    <p>Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1">Umar
                            Wirahadikusumah</persName> has been invited to visit the U.S. in late
                        March and early April, 1971. The Indonesian military leadership has clearly
                        indicated that his primary mission will be to obtain a high level reaction
                        to the Indonesian Five Year Military Plan.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. will consequently be faced in the near future with the problem of
                        (1) commenting on Indonesia's plan to assume a regional role and (2)
                        responding in some manner to an Indonesian request for <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for this plan. This paper discusses
                        first the principal factors influencing the Indonesians to make this
                        request, secondly the assets and liabilities which Indonesia would bring to
                        a regional security role, and finally possible U.S. responses to this
                        Indonesian démarche.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of further factors underlying the Indonesian
                        request and possible U.S. responses.]</p>

                    <p>The December 15–16 meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia
                            (<gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>) in Rotterdam illustrates how a
                        multilateral assistance effort can in time assume an inner dynamism of its
                        own. Because this aid consortium so clearly demonstrates the basic
                        principles of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, it
                        is worth noting some of the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>'s
                        accomplishments <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0740"/>beyond those
                        mirrored in the encouraging statistics of Indonesia's performance and donor
                        nations' response.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> has grown not only in terms of
                        donors and donations but, perhaps more important, in its ability to promote
                        healthy change in Indonesia's institutions. The unanimous approval given to
                        Indonesia's $640 million foreign assistance projection for 1971, the
                        decision of four countries to join the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in
                        announcing their assistance in advance of the April pledging session, and
                        Canada's entry into full <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> membership
                        may be attributed in part to Indonesia's sound economic performance over the
                        past year. Also a major contributing factor, however, was the member
                        nations' increased confidence in the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>
                        as an effective vehicle for stimulating modernization in all sectors of
                        Indonesian society.</p>
                    <p>After commending Indonesian performance in economic stabilization, the
                        Rotterdam meeting discussed candidly the many institutional deficiencies
                        which continue to hamper development efforts. Criticism on the part of
                        donors, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, however, was
                        most carefully phrased so that it might be used as a lever by Indonesia's
                        problem solvers to lift burdens imposed on their economy by special interest
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>Steps taken to ensure a more rational use of Indonesia's now substantial and
                        rapidly expanding oil revenues is one example of how moves by the <gloss

                        Pertamina has long served as a source of support for influential segments of
                        Indonesian society, including the Armed Forces, it was politically
                        impossible two years ago for Indonesia's economic planners to demand an
                        accurate accounting of its receipts and expenditures. Brief mention of this
                        problem by donors prior to and during last year's <gloss target="#t_IGGI1"
                            >IGGI</gloss> meeting, however, set in motion joint discussions between
                        Indonesia's Planning Bureau and World Bank representatives which resulted in
                        written recommendations to President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>. At the Rotterdam meeting this month the Indonesians
                        were able to announce that legislation is now before Parliament which will
                        place a significant portion of Indonesia's oil revenues into the national
                        treasury for the benefit of the society as a whole. The <gloss
                            target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>'s Dutch Chairman responded with a tactful
                        request for further information on oil revenues during the next <gloss
                            target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss> session, a peg which will undoubtedly be
                        used in coming months to initiate further reforms.</p>
                    <p>In much the same manner, improvements are being initiated in the tax and
                        tariff structure, investment policies, fertilizer distribution, floor prices
                        for the rice farmer, and several other pressing areas. These are all
                        politically volatile sectors in which the intervention of individual <pb

                        framework, however, has permitted donor nations, the World Bank and the
                        International Monetary Fund to give discreet, highly effective support to
                        the efforts of President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        and his economic planners to modernize their society's institutions.
                        Although these particular accomplishments of the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1"
                            >IGGI</gloss> must remain unheralded, they are as essential to

                    <p>Indonesian Ambassador Soedjatmoko saw the President on July 27 for the
                        purpose of paying a farewell call. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"

                        at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Ambassador began by discussing the President's July 15
                        China announcement,<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">President <persName

                        change in world history. The President agreed that it represents a massive
                        change in world history—a visit by the leader of the most powerful country
                        in the world to the most populous country.</p>
                    <p>The President assured the Ambassador that our action relates solely to our
                        relations with Mainland China, and is not in derogation of any of our
                        friends. Indonesia, he continued, is a tremendous force in Asia and in the
                        Pacific. We have told the Indonesians we will assist them in their military
                        programs. Under no circumstances will this Government <pb n="693"
                            xml:id="pg_693" facs="0742"/>move in any way against the interests of
                        Indonesia. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that
                        we have ordered an increase in U.S. military assistance to Indonesia. The
                        President added that we have internal problems to contend with here.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that it is of principal importance to his country to know
                        what kind of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> presence there will be in
                        Asia in the future, in terms of economic and military aid. The President
                        replied that we will continue our economic aid and we will even keep our
                        military presence. Indonesia need have no fear of a <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then commented that what is important is how to place our
                        withdrawal from Vietnam into some future kind of system. It is not enough to
                        give personal assurance—one must make specific proposals. The Ambassador
                        wanted to relieve himself of some anxiety, particularly on Japan. Everything
                        should be done to keep Japan from going nuclear. There must be a concert of
                        world powers, of which one is not assured. But it must be done.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized his agreement on the importance of maintaining our
                        world presence. But some, like <persName corresp="#p_FJW2"
                            >Fulbright</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1"
                            >Mansfield</persName>, are a problem. Actually, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> is a great fellow, the President
                        added. But if we get out of Asia, Japan will go nuclear or make a deal with
                        somebody.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador emphasized that his country is not worried over the terms of a
                        Vietnam settlement or about the American President. We are worried, he said,
                        about the credibility of the American people's performance. The Ambassador
                        also commented that Japan is basically a tribal society, with no world
                        view.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then referred to the rubber issue, with which Indonesia was
                        very concerned. [This involved the <gloss target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss>'s
                        resumption of U.S. rubber stockpile sales, announced July 7.]<note n="3"

                    </list>
                    <p>The President opened the meeting by welcoming Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> and expressing his personal
                        appreciation for the Ambassador's effective efforts over the past two years.
                        The President recalled his meeting with Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> at the time of the President's
                        Asian trip, just after the Ambassador's arrival in Djakarta.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked the Ambassador for his view on the effectiveness of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and the
                        Ambassador's estimate of the influence that the military had on <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s government. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> replied that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s demeanor was one of
                        great reserve. Although his accession to power was based on the actions of
                        the professional military in Indonesia he had been careful to insure a
                        proper balance of civilian and military influence. His recent appointments
                        were primarily civilian.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired about how President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> was getting along with Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, noting that in the past there had
                        been some friction between the two men. The Ambassador answered that their
                        relationship appeared to have warmed in recent months, especially after
                            <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> played an active role in
                        support of the President in the recent elections.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> stated that the
                        situation in Indonesia was very promising at the present time. In response
                        to a Presidential question on the progress made with respect to U.S.
                        investment in the country, the Ambassador reported that this year foreign
                        investments would amount to $1.1 billion U.S. dollars, of which one-third
                        represented U.S. investment. He noted that Indonesian oil exploitation had
                        increased substantially and that their hardwood production would amount this
                        year to over $100 million, with the possibility of reaching $500 million in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName> whether the atmosphere was favorable for U.S.
                        investment in Indonesia. The Ambassador answered that considerable
                        improvement had been made, although <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0744"
                        />there were still many frustrations which a prospective investor had to
                        overcome. He stated that it would take a considerable period of time to
                        reach an optimum situation but that patience on the part of U.S. investors
                        would generally meet with success.</p>
                    <p>The President next asked for the Ambassador's assessment of the Indonesians'
                        attitude toward his China initiative. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName> replied that without question the Indonesians were
                        experiencing an underlying nervousness with respect to the U.S. initiative.
                        The President stated that he wished the Ambassador to actively attempt to
                        put U.S. logic in its proper perspective. He noted that many incorrectly had
                        assumed that our initiative was based on a U.S. assessment that the Chinese
                        had changed or, in fact, the Chinese Communists had never been a source of
                        tension. This was patently incorrect. The U.S. had carefully assessed the
                        need to review our posture with respect to China and had concluded that the
                        dangers of the continued isolation of 800 million Chinese were no longer
                        acceptable. We had concluded, therefore, that a very careful deliberate and
                        pragmatic opening towards normalization represented in the long run a
                        strengthening of the security of the countries in the area and reduced the
                        risks that an atmosphere of isolation and confrontation would entail. He
                        emphasized the importance of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName>'s making clear to the Indonesians that our
                        approaches to the Chinese were deliberate and calculated. They were not
                        based on the naive assumption that fundamental changes in Chinese
                        performance could be expected.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2"
                            >Galbraith</persName> for his assessment of the Indonesian attitude
                        toward the U.S. military presence in Asia. The Ambassador answered that the
                        Indonesians were extremely nervous at the prospect of U.S. withdrawal. He
                        noted that in fact General <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName>, the
                        Chief of the Policy Planning Staff, was visiting Washington now with the
                        view towards ascertaining long range U.S. plans with respect to a military
                        presence in Asia. The President stated that the Indonesian view appeared
                        consistent with the view of other Asians and that he had no intention of
                        eliminating our military presence in Asia. At the same time it was obvious
                        that the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict would require some
                        reductions.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked the Ambassador how the Indonesians view U.S. Vietnam
                        policies. The Ambassador replied that the main concern of the Indonesians
                        was that we would withdraw too quickly from Vietnam. The Ambassador added
                        that the present political turmoil in Saigon did not represent a problem to
                        the Indonesians except to the degree that it might affect our withdrawal
                        rates.</p>
                    <p>In concluding the meeting, the President noted that there were those high
                        level policy makers in the U.S. Government who felt quite strongly that U.S.
                        assistance to Indonesia and, in fact, other developing <pb n="696"

                        should be channeled primarily through economic assistance and that military
                        assistance tended to retard progress. The President stated that he did not
                        accept this view. He asserted that it was essential that all understand that
                        a developing country such as Indonesia, with thousands of miles of
                        coastline, a strong military influence and an essentially military
                        leadership had to have a substantial military capability if political
                        stability was to be assured.<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">

                            April 9. <persName>Kennedy</persName> noted, according to a memorandum
                            of conversation of that date, that Assistant Secretary <persName

                            assistance, “dominated our policies in Indonesia from his Washington
                            desk,” and had “hand-picked” the top officers at the Embassy in Jakarta.
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> added that “he had been very
                            unimpressed with both their attitudes and their ability.” (Ibid., White

                        mind as U.S. assistance efforts are developed. The Ambassador responded that
                        the $25 million military assistance package for Indonesia appeared to be a
                        sound one which maintained the proper balance between military and economic
                        aid.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>: “So I gave them—I said:
                        ‘The President asked me to see you and [unclear] too great to withdraw. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is designed to
                        draw on these [unclear] and so forth.' And I talked about the foreign aid
                        thing and I told him that I'd talk to him on the foreign aid picture and
                        said that you had recognized that [unclear] of protectionism of the United
                        States largely because of what had been happening to it, and that you took
                        the steps on August 15th both to correct the imbalance in our trade
                        situation, and secondly, Congress still wants protectionism before they
                        became too vocal in the United States. As part of that, you felt just that
                        you could cut foreign aid ten percent and you did that. Well, but the
                        Congress said, because they were in control of an opposite Party, thought
                        that they had to get in some of the political popularity of
                        protectionism—ok, so—growing in this country, so they just cut it all out.
                        Now I'm sure the President can get it restored, and I said, ‘I don’t know in
                        exactly what forms or in what amount but the administration is going to do
                        everything within our power—'”</p>
                    <p>President: “Um-hmm.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>: “‘to restore foreign aid.’
                        And I said, ‘We’re not going to leave Indonesia. We're going to stay in
                        Southeast Asia militarily, financially, economically, [unclear], for as long
                        as we can now see.' And— so this is quite reassuring to all of them. And I
                        think it particularly was to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>. His wife entertained at a luncheon for us, took us
                        all to her home. One night with about ten of his Cabinet, he had dinner for
                        us and all of our group and we had—we had a real good meeting with them on
                        three different occasions. We met with all of his top economic people. And
                        I'm very impressed with them.”</p>
                    <p>President: “Are you? In Indonesia?”</p>

                    <p>3. The Secretary conveyed President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                            >Suharto</persName> and expressed his own pleasure at being able to
                        visit Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> began by describing, in
                        familiar terms, Indonesia's economic development plans. He said these were
                        modest in the first five years, covering merely the provision of the basic
                        necessities of food, clothing and housing (the latter in the form of
                        materials only). In the second five year plan some processing of the raw
                        materials which constitute Indonesia's main exports would hopefully begin,
                        establishing an industrial capacity. In the third five year plan Indonesia
                        would start to produce its basic industrial requirements. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> mentioned the development of
                        oil, minerals and timber which would provide additional foreign
                        exchange.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said that Indonesia
                        manufactured about 80 percent of its requirements in textiles but produced
                        very little of the raw materials required. Indonesia did not seem to be
                        particularly favorable for cotton production and most of its cotton
                        therefore, thus far, had to be supplied from abroad.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> emphasized that
                        Indonesia's economic development depended mainly on its own efforts but,
                        particularly in the present transition period, it also depended importantly
                        on foreign aid. And in the provision of foreign aid, the position of the
                        U.S. was key to the provision of foreign aid by others. He expressed some
                        concern about the recent Senate actions;<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">The
                            Senate rejected the House-passed foreign aid bill (<gloss
                                target="#t_HR1">HR</gloss> 9910) on October 29, thus failing to
                            authorize appropriations for both military and economic aid in fiscal
                            years 1972 and 1973. The defeat of the bill constituted the first
                            outright rejection of foreign aid legislation in the 24-year history of
                            the program. (Congress and the Nation, Vol. III, 1969–1972, pp. 876–877)

                            an inhibiting effect on other potential donors.” <persName

                            comment on the matter now since those aspects of the economic policy
                            were still under study.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7
                            INDON)</note> about the announced 10 percent cut in foreign aid; about
                        the replenishment of IDA funds; and about Cambodian aid. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> stressed the importance of aid
                        to Cambodia, a country which was not only threatened by subversion along
                        with its neighbors, but by the presence of foreign troops. The defense of
                        Cambodia was of major importance to the defense of Cambodia's neighbors.
                        Indonesia was weak and could do little to help Cambodia but it <pb n="701"
                            xml:id="pg_701" facs="0750"/>was trying to do what it could to increase
                        Cambodia's sense and capacity for national resistance.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> suggested that the
                        Secretary might wish to comment on both the short and long term outlook for
                        U.S. economic and military assistance in the region.</p>
                    <p>8. The Secretary began by describing the basic reasons for the recent Senate
                        action on the aid bill. He said this was not a case of sudden pique because
                        of the vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on Taiwan, although
                        that may have been the immediate cause for the particular timing. The
                        underlying cause was the mood of the country and the conviction of the
                        American people that the U.S. had too long been bearing all the burdens of
                        foreign assistance and common defense to the neglect of its own national
                        interests, while other countries, able to help, were not doing so to the
                        extent of their capacities and were, moreover, taking unfair advantage of
                        the U.S. in trade.</p>
                    <p>9. The Secretary said that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>'s announcement of a 10 percent cut in foreign aid had
                        been the most popular thing this administration had done. 83 percent of the
                        people had expressed approval and only 6 percent had disapproved. The
                        economic measures announced on August 15 had also met with strong public
                        approval. This did not mean that the American people were returning to
                        isolationism or would fail to share their wealth or to show compassion for
                        the needs of others. But the administration had won public approval for its
                        measures demonstrating that it was doing something about the U.S. balance of
                        payments situation and about the lack of fairness which had grown into the
                        currency and other financial and trade relationships between the U.S. and,
                        especially, the industrialized countries. The Secretary said that in his
                        view the Senate action was, as is often true, 60–75 days behind the mood of
                        public opinion in the United States. That public opinion had already
                        shifted, as a result of the administration's action, in favor of the
                        continuation of foreign aid, in the Secretary's opinion. The Senate would be
                        realizing this and acting accordingly.</p>
                    <p>10. The Secretary said he did not know what form the legislation would take
                        but he was personally confident the Senate would act to continue aid—both
                        military and economic. It was in the U.S. interest that it do so.</p>
                    <p>11. The Secretary stressed the common interests of Indonesia and the U.S. in
                        Indonesia's development. Indonesia produced raw and semi-processed materials
                        for which the U.S. had an insatiable appetite. On the other hand,
                        Indonesia's population of 120 million provided a potential market of great
                        interest to the U.S. We wanted a greater not a lesser relationship with
                        Indonesia. It would make no sense for the U.S. to abandon Indonesia at this
                        point; on the contrary it made good sense for the U.S. to expand Indonesia's
                        economic development and help assure its stability.</p>
                    <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0751"/>
                    <p>12. The Secretary also stressed the intentions of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration, and in his opinion of
                        the U.S., to remain in Southeast Asia in a military, economic, financial and
                        cultural sense. The U.S. was withdrawing its troops from Vietnam and it was
                        the U.S. policy to avoid involvement in further military action in Southeast
                        Asia. But the U.S. would continue to exert an influence and to do its part
                        in further strengthening the ability of the countries in Southeast Asia to
                        defend themselves and to maintain their independence and develop themselves
                        economically. Indeed it was the success of the efforts thus far of the
                        counties of Southeast Asia in strengthening their own capacities and the
                        success of U.S. programs in helping them do this that had made it possible
                        for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to go to Peking
                        and Moscow with the objective of reducing world tensions and
                        misunderstandings that might lead to confrontation. This was also in the
                        common interest of the free world.</p>
                    <p>13. The Secretary affirmed his strong personal belief that the U.S. would
                        continue to help Indonesia and that it would make the pledge, as it had in
                        the past, in the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_IGGI1">IGGI</gloss>
                        December next. The Secretary stressed that he could not, of course,
                        guarantee this but he was personally confident that it would take place.</p>
                    <p>14. With regard to the ten percent cut, which as he had already mentioned had
                        served to strengthen the hand of the administration in continuing foreign
                        aid as a principal policy tool, the Secretary said there was no requirement
                        that it be leveled across the board and no certainty that it would affect
                        the Indonesian program at all. He expressed the opinion that whatever aid
                        monies the U.S. had would go first to those that supported the U.S. In this
                        connection, the Secretary called attention to the recent vote in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on Taiwan, noting that Indonesia had

                        Indonesia had given the U.S. on the Taiwan issue. The Secretary said, “We
                        lost, but our position was right.”</p>
                    <p>15. The Secretary also noted the fact that the replenishment bill for IDA
                        funds had passed in the Senate and was now under consideration in the House.
                        He thought that the outlook for this legislation was good.</p>
                    <p>16. With regard to Cambodia, the Secretary said the administration had every
                        intention of continuing its assistance to Cambodia.</p>

                        For our part we are pledging, consistent with our formula last year, to meet

                        this year in inducing them to increase their contributions. You may count on

                    <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s visit with you
                        presents an excellent opportunity to set forth to you my views on the
                        importance of your country's security and continuing economic development
                        and my determination to maintain our support for your outstanding efforts in
                        these vital areas.</p>
                    <p>In my letter to you of December 11,<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d324">Document 324 and the footnotes thereto</ref>.</note>
                        I outlined the extent to which I share your concern for strengthening the
                        foundations of Indonesia's security and economic well being. In this regard,
                        I recognize the strains placed on Indonesia's resources by the problems of
                        strengthening its <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0756"/>security while
                        also maintaining the momentum of economic development which your country has
                        attained under your dedicated leadership. We in the United States want to do
                        everything we can to assist you in meeting this formidable challenge.</p>
                    <p>I also understand the concern which you expressed to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> recently over the threat which
                        Communist expansionism— whether originating in Moscow, Peking, or
                        Hanoi—poses for Indonesia and Southeast Asia. I welcome your interest in
                        helping to strengthen the other Southeast Asian nations so that they may
                        cope with this threat, as well as your plans to improve Indonesia's
                        cooperation through <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> and particularly
                        with Japan and Australia.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these considerations, I want to tell you that, despite the
                        severe limitation which our Congress has placed upon funds for military
                        assistance, we will continue our military assistance for Indonesia this
                        fiscal year at a level at least equal to that of last fiscal year. Further,
                        I am asking the Congress for funds to increase our military assistance to
                        you in Fiscal Year 1973. I believe this assistance on our part, together
                        with our contributions through the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia,
                        constitutes one of the most important means by which the United States can
                        help to insure that the tremendous progress realized during the past six
                        years under your leadership is not lost, but will indeed continue.</p>
                    <p>I also want to reassure you, as I have on earlier occasions, that the United
                        States intends to remain in Asia to play a balancing role in the stability
                        of the region, and that we will stand firmly behind all of our treaty
                        commitments. Toward these ends, we will retain sufficient air, naval, and
                        ground forces in Asia in order to accomplish these purposes.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia has a vital role to play in the future peace, prosperity, and
                        stability of Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole. As I recently conveyed to
                        you through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName>, I
                        shall have your country's interests very much in mind as I go to Peking and
                        then to Moscow in the coming months. Knowing your keen interest in my trips,
                        I will plan to be in touch with you when I return as to their results, and I
                        would appreciate your reaction to these missions. I will hope, too, that you
                        will feel free to pass any thoughts on these and other matters to General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> which he may report
                        to me upon his return.</p>
                    <p>With warm personal regards,</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Currently negotiations are going on (in a somewhat desultory fashion, as
                        suits the Indonesians) for the clandestine procurement of a MIG–17, MIG–19,
                        and MIG–21, all in operating condition from the Indonesian Air Force. The
                        U.S. Air Force's offering price is $250,000, a small sum which reflects the
                        fact that the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> has had previous access
                        to these machines in Korea, Cambodia, and Israel. Additional units are
                        desired, however, for testing.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia, which obtained a large stock of Soviet armaments during the
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> era, has become a
                        prime source of Soviet matériel. Soviet replacements are no longer available
                        to, nor desired by, a pro-Western Indonesian Government. The risks involved
                        in obtaining Soviet matériel covertly, while undeniably present, are
                        minimized by sloppy Indonesian inventory control in the past and consequent
                        Soviet inability to maintain effective surveillance of the matériel. The
                        Soviets are further hampered by travel restrictions, much reduced staff, and
                        a generally hostile attitude on the part of the Indonesian Government and
                        armed forces.</p>
                    <p>During the past two years the U.S. services have spent some two million
                        dollars for Soviet matériel in Indonesia. The Soviet P–15 surface-to-surface
                        missile, various fire control systems, anti-submarine warfare gear, and the
                        Fan Song radar used in the Soviet <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system
                        are the major items obtained. All of these items (some still in the original
                        crates) were air-lifted out of Indonesia without incident. In the case of
                        the Fan Song radar three large vans were involved. The Air Force proposed
                        using the huge and conspicuous C–5A which <gloss target="#t_INR1"
                            >INR</gloss> refused to agree to. Eventually <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                            >USAF</gloss> planes delivering civic action type supplies to the
                        Indonesian services brought back the Fan Song vans on return flights. In all
                        cases extreme care has been taken to do loading in hangars wherever possible
                        and at night by specially vetted Indonesian military teams.</p>

                    <p>An outgrowth of the procurement of the P–15 missile was the opportunity to
                        monitor the firing of several P–15 missiles by the Indonesian Navy. When the
                        Indonesians proposed test firings at a target island in the Java Sea, the
                        Naval Attaché, knowing that the Indonesians were scrapping SKORY class
                        destroyers, suggested that one be sold— covertly—to the U.S. Navy and that
                        it be used as a target ship. The Indonesians agreed and with U.S. guidance
                        welded impact gages to the hull and installed a transponder on the mast.
                        They also agreed to film, in color, and “rooster-tail” of the missile when
                        fired and turn the films over to the U.S. The telemetry of the firings (the
                        ship was hit and sank) </p>

                        <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>'s role in the procurement of Soviet
                        matériel is to make certain that the operation has the approval of the

                        General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> told <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had taken keen interest in General's
                        visit to Indonesia at invitation General <persName corresp="#p_UWLG1"
                            >Umar</persName> and had called <persName corresp="#p_WWC1"
                            >Westmoreland</persName> to White House few days before he left
                        Washington and had asked <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                        <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0759"/>to pass to <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> President's personal esteem for
                        accomplishments <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        Government and President's continuing interest in Indonesia. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> thanked <persName
                            corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and spoke briefly of the value
                        he placed on his relations with President and on assurances he has received
                        from <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on continued support for
                        economic and military programs.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> spoke of the priority
                        given economic development in the Indonesian budget and of the austerity
                        imposed on the armed forces which receive only a small part of total budget
                        resources, barely enough for upkeep. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> said it was hoped and expected that in another few
                        years and with economic development promising to gain some momentum,
                        additional budget resources could be made available for the development of
                        the Indonesian armed forces. He said Indonesia's armed forces understood and
                        agreed to this approach.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> gave <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> letter <gloss
                            target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> which <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName> read. <persName corresp="#p_WWC1"
                            >Westmoreland</persName> then explained that although President had
                        asked Congress for appropriations which would have supported $25 million
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Indonesia, Congress had cut
                        overall appropriations for military assistance by 40 percent, that President
                        hoped to provide Indonesia with at least $18 million for <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> which, together with $2.3 million provided
                        in excess supplies and other excess items which might be found useful to
                        Indonesia, should raise total for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> above
                        $18 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–72. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> also mentioned no-cost lease
                        arrangement on ships for Indonesian navy. <persName corresp="#p_WWC1"
                            >Westmoreland</persName> said utilization all these sources might
                        produce figure approaching $25 million and President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> hoped to be able to do better for
                        Indonesia in following fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he understood
                        President's problems with Congress. He said $25 million <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> was itself less than Indonesia hoped for
                        and felt it needed.</p>
                    <p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that I monitored
                        our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program very closely and that with
                        amount of money which we hoped to make available and with prospect of
                        somewhat more in following year I thought we would be alright. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said our ability to plan a
                        program on a two-year basis at the $25 million level should be alright.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> said he also brought
                        assurances from President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that
                        in connection with his forthcoming trip to Peking there would be no changes
                        in U.S. policy affecting Indonesia. The President would keep <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> informed on results of his trip
                        and on anything that transpired of interest to or affecting Indonesia.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> indicated his
                        understanding of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                        purposes and his appreciation that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> was keeping him informed.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he would be going
                        to Australia and New Zealand in next few days on state visit. He hoped to
                        explore with governments <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0760"/>those two
                        countries assessment of common threat of communism in area and desirability
                        of closer understanding and cooperation among nations in area facing that
                        threat. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> indicated he
                        hoped to develop with Australia and New Zealand, and also with Japan, common
                        view on how to face threats to peace and security in this area. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> mentioned the saber jet
                        squadron which Australia will be providing Indonesia, indicating that these
                        planes would be helpful in maintaining Indonesia's pilot proficiency.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> indicated that he
                        too would be going to Australia and New Zealand, though slightly ahead of
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It was apparent that there had been some
                        difficulty in arranging for <persName corresp="#p_WWC1"
                            >Westmoreland</persName>'s appointment with <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, presumably because the latter
                        is preparing for his state visits mentioned above and because he was
                        involved immediately after the meeting in ceremonies connected with recent
                        weddings his daughter and son. This probably explains why <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> did not encourage a broader
                        discussion Southeast Asian problems. There was, however, some indication
                        that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was aware of
                        extensive discussions <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                        had over two-day period with Army Chief of Staff <persName

                        <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> started by extending to

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s warmest regards and
                        highest esteem. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> slanted his
                        presentation toward Indonesian concerns, underlining fact President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had made no deals
                        concerning other countries, that U.S. planned keep its commitments and

                        approach to China. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> told
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that he and I were
                        authorized to inform him that U.S. would maintain its present force levels
                        less those related to Vietnamization, in Western Pacific in <gloss

                            >Green</persName> offered to go into more detail on these force levels
                        with Deputy Chief Commander of Armed Forces Panggabean whom we would be
                        meeting later.</p>
                    <p>2. In outlining main points and impressions emerging from the talks,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> included the following:</p>
                    <p>A. Peking seeks to avoid involvement in war and seems genuinely to desire a
                        better relationship with U.S. Peking supported North Korea's 8-point plans
                        for unification, but also interested in avoiding war to achieve it. Peking
                        supports 7-point <gloss target="#t_PRG1">PRG</gloss> peace plan but seemed
                        less disposed than previously to have that conflict continue indefinitely
                        since in its eyes this might serve to strengthen Soviet position in
                        Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>B. Both sides subscribed to the Bandung principles even though <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> does not in fact live up to them, but it
                        can now be better called to account for them.</p>
                    <p>C. Peking Government say they are concerned about Japanese militarism,
                        although U.S. does not believe this would be problem so long as U.S.–Japan
                        security treaty exists. <gloss target="#t_CHICOMS1">ChiComs</gloss> can be
                        extension, therefore, come to see that maintenance U.S. security treaty with
                        Japan could serve <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> interests though it
                        would never say so publicly.</p>
                    <p>D. Taiwan was a most difficult issue but we now have a situation where,
                        despite continuing U.S. commitments and ties to the <gloss target="#t_ROC1"
                            >ROC</gloss>, we have in prospect an expanding dialogue and contact with
                        with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. </p>
                    <p>E. U.S. now reaffirmed that it will keep its commitments and continue its
                        assistance to its friends and allies.</p>
                    <p>F. U.S. will continue to be power in Western Pacific.</p>
                    <p>G. China's announced position is the removal of all U.S. forces from sea, but
                        it evidently does not want this done in way that enhances Soviet influence
                        in sea. (<persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> summed up true <gloss
                            target="#t_CHICOMS1">ChiCom</gloss> attitude as perhaps being “Yankee go
                        home, but gradually.”)</p>
                    <p>H. Overshadowing all this and emerging as basic reason for <gloss
                            target="#t_CHICOMS1">ChiCom</gloss> interest in talks is their
                        fundamental fear of Soviets and concern of Soviets extending influence in
                        Southeast Asia and elsewhere. <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0762"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_CHICOMS1">ChiComs</gloss> also fearful of revived Japanese
                        militarism (and an unexpressed fear of Japanese economic hegomony in <gloss
                            target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss>). Peking seeking to split Tokyo and
                        Washington especially on Taiwan issue so as to isolate <gloss
                            target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> all the more and bring Taiwan under <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> control. There were of course other <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> motives as well, both internal and
                        external.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed deep

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s effort to reduce world
                        tensions and strengthen peace. He thought it salutary that <gloss

                        for Bandung principles, including non-interference in internal affairs other
                        countries, non-agression, coexistence and peaceful settlement of disputes.

                        they supported suppressed peoples. This meant they will not only support
                        those who seek independence but those who sought as national liberation

                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said he agreed with this and
                        that U.S. was not letting its guard down even while extending hand of
                        conciliation. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stressed
                        importance of seizing opportunity of present situation to do what could be

                        importance of U.S. making clear it stands behind its friends, and allies. He
                        said neighboring countries in Southeast Asia need moral support as well as

                            >Suharto</persName> stressed importance of building national capacity

                    <p>2. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>, Chief
                        of Presidential Secretariat General Sudharmono (who took notes) and Widodo,
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s regular
                        interpreter, were present on Indonesian side, and Asst. Secretary <persName

                    <p>3. The Secretary said President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        had stressed importance of Secretary's visit to Indonesia, and his desire
                        that Secretary brief <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                        fully on summits. Secretary gave <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"

                                target="#t_TOSEC1">Tosec</gloss> 89/ </note> Secretary said he would
                        speak first generally and then invite <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1"
                            >Suharto</persName>'s views. Secretary stressed there were no secret
                        agreements with either Peking or Moscow. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had made clear to both that we were
                        continuing unchanged our policies toward, and our relations with our friends
                        and allies.</p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary said we believe that talks in Peking and Moscow had tended
                        to reduce tensions and could lead to further negotiations and reduction of
                        threats toward independence of countries like Indonesia. But we had no
                        intention of letting down our guard. We would base nothing on trust and make
                        no concessions, but we would be prepared to take any reciprocal action to
                        further reduce tensions.</p>
                    <p>5. In case of China, because there had been no conversations for 22 years,
                        great deal of initial conversation concerned getting to know each other.
                        Chinese felt it necessary make full statement of their dogma for the record.
                        Once that was out of the way, talks turned to bilateral matters and to
                        relationships in Pacific. Two sides agreed to put Taiwan <pb n="715"
                            xml:id="pg_715" facs="0764"/>aside and let that issue take its course.
                        U.S. made clear it would continue its treaty and diplomatic relationships
                        with Taiwan but would conduct these in way not hostile to <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. We agreed have contacts in Paris, <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and through special emissaries to Peking.
                        Increased trade and exchanges are in offing, but they likely to expand
                        gradually. In this way general improvement relations could ensue without
                        disturbing U.S. relations with Taiwan. Treaties and relationships in Pacific
                        with Japan, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and others would also not be
                        disturbed.</p>
                    <p>6. Secretary said with respect to Vietnam, U.S. would withdraw its troops but
                        in process make sure North Vietnam does not overrun South Vietnam. We
                        believe <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> recognizes that U.S., having
                        reduced troop strength Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, etc., has no territorial
                        aspirations in East Asia. Also <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        recognizes U.S. presence has stabilizing influence; that if U.S. left vacuum
                        would result and be filled by Soviet presence or revived Japanese
                        militarism. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had
                        emphasized that we would maintain our troops in Pacific and there would be
                        no change in our relations with our allies.</p>
                    <p>7. Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had
                        recently followed up on bilateral exchanges, students, athletic teams,
                        scientists, etc. He had discussed Vietnam with <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> evidently wants
                        negotiated settlement. They don't want Soviet position strengthened in
                        Vietnam. They have not permitted Soviets to use their ports which has helped
                        make mining North Vietnam harbors so successful. We think Chinese prefer
                        negotiated settlement Vietnam and will help, but we are not sure how much
                        influence they can exert.</p>
                    <p>8. In order avoid <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> suspicions <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reported to <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> on Moscow visit.</p>
                    <p>9. Secretary said it is difficult to judge Chinese intentions and it is
                        possible they might be deceitful and take advantage. He said there is no one
                        who understands this better than President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> who intends to be wary. The U.S. will make no
                        concessions nor base anything on trust but will be prepared to take any
                        reciprocal action to reduce tensions.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> asked Secretary to
                        advise further on possibilities for settling Vietnam problem. Secretary said
                        he thought possibilities for negotiated settlement were good but question
                        was when it might take place. There are different theories about whether it
                        is more likely to occur before or after our elections.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> noted that in <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                        communiqué there was reference to Bandung principles and noninterference in
                        internal affairs of others. He also noted contradiction between this and
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>'s announced support for “oppressed
                        peoples” and for “wars of national liberation”. <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716"
                            facs="0765"/>will continue and for this reason we have to be sure that
                        independent nations are strengthened not only militarily but economically.
                        Secretary expressed pleasure at Indonesian economic progress and in support
                        U.S. able to give this worthy Indonesian objective.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wondered whether there
                        was possibility that Vietnam would emerge as communist country something
                        like Yugoslavia. Secretary said he thought South Vietnam growing stronger
                        and has good chance to survive as independent entity. They were fighting
                        well on ground where there were no longer U.S. combat troops. All Vietnamese
                        refugees go south not north, which gives some indication of where they feel
                        most comfortable. North Vietnam had charged that Government South Vietnam
                        were puppets. Once U.S. troops departed they couldn't make that argument. We
                        think if there were ceasefire now South Vietnam would be able to stand and
                        there would be a political contest over time to see who would prevail. Our
                        judgment is that people of South Vietnam would not support communists,
                        Secretary said.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said that within
                        framework U.S. attempts to reduce tensions and reach settlement with
                        communists, Indonesia sought to strengthen its resilience against
                        subversion. His visits to Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been in that
                        context. Secretary said we had been pleased with Indonesian initiatives and
                        with success of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s visits.
                        In our talks with Australians and New Zealanders we had said we would
                        cooperate in any way we could in support and in context Indonesian
                        independence and nonalignment.<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3">In a separate

                            Philippines. Their conversation was reported in telegram 3331 from
                            Belgrade, July 8. (Ibid., Conference Files, 1966–72: Lot 70 D 387, Box
                            526)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>14. Before turning to subject of Moscow Summit Secretary said we had been
                        impressed with Chinese friendliness toward Americans and had impression that
                        Chinese trust Americans more than they do Russians. Chinese know we will
                        continue our alliances and support our friends but don't look upon U.S. as
                        threat to them as much as they do Soviets.</p>
                    <p>15. Secretary said there were two reasons Soviets were anxious that President
                        make trip to Moscow: (A) concern over improvement of our relations with
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> (although Soviets did not say so)
                        and (B) economic matters. In this latter connection, major security problems
                        on Chinese/Soviet border as well as on Soviet western frontier had caused
                        big economic drain. Build up of nuclear power was very costly, and no matter
                        how much money Soviets spend, they know U.S. would not let them get ahead.
                        Output of U.S. economy twice that of Soviets, therefore Soviets had embarked
                        on detente in Europe to reduce cost and <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717"
                            facs="0766"/>tensions there and to enable them to focus on Chinese
                        problem. That they were anxious to improve relations with U.S. was borne out
                        by their going ahead with summit despite U.S. mining of Haiphong and bombing
                        North Vietnam. Soviets also feel need for more consumer goods. They need
                        better production facilities, technology and credit.</p>
                    <p>16. Secretary said Soviets turned out whole upper echelon of government for
                        talks. As many as twelve members of Politburo were present at one time and
                        this was unprecedented. There was elaborate entertainment. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> addressed Russian people on
                        TV before which his scheduled appearance was advertised and Soviet people
                        were urged to listen.</p>
                    <p>17. Seven separate agreements were signed in Moscow. It was worked out so
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, Podgorny and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> all signed some of them. These
                        included agreements on health, environment, cooperation in space, prevention
                        of incidents at sea (first agreement between two military establishments
                        since World War II). Most important was the <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> agreement providing for freeze on offensive and defensive
                        weapons. Each side is permitted two <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        sites to defend capitals and one <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> site
                        each. Without going into details Secretary said both U.S. and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> know that neither side can strike other
                        without being destroyed by other. If Soviets decide to strike first there is
                        nothing they could do to prevent U.S. from destroying Soviet Union and same
                        thing is true other way around. Thus, unless governments run by crazy people
                        the threat of nuclear exchange is ruled out except by misunderstanding or
                        accidental launch. Procedures have been worked out designed to avoid either
                        of these eventualities. Secretary said we think result of visit will be
                        better relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at least for a
                        while. We expect that this will result in more exchanges of scientists and
                        others and additional agreements. European Security Conference was discussed
                        and if it can be well prepared it should help reduce tensions in Europe.</p>
                    <p>18. Secretary said he had talked about trade with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                            >Kosygin</persName> who did all the talking in the economic field. We
                        expect over time to work out problems in the economic field. Complication,
                        however, is that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has debt to U.S. and
                        this makes it difficult to extend the credit <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> seeks for its trade with U.S.</p>
                    <p>19. Secretary said Soviets indicated willingness to help with negotiated
                        settlement on Vietnam. Subsequently Podgorny has gone to Hanoi to present
                        some of the things U.S. talked to Soviets about.</p>
                    <p>20. Secretary stressed again there were no secret agreements and nothing
                        discussed with Soviets that would affect nations in this part of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>21. Secretary gave <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> some
                        atmospherics of Soviet leadership. Although <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> clearly dominates others, one has impression
                        Politburo works together. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        cultivated others in public. In meetings <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718"
                            facs="0767"/>he did the talking. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                            >Kosygin</persName> was less active except on economic issues.</p>
                    <p>22. On Middle East problems there was not much discussed. Secretary had
                        talked to Podgorny, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> and was satisfied
                        Soviets will not promote outbreak of hostilities and want cease-fire to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed concern that
                        because of U.S. and British withdrawals, vacuums would develop into which
                        Soviets would move and that because of Soviet/<gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss> tensions subversion would increase. Secretary said we would
                        be careful to withdraw in way that would not create vacuum. Secretary noted
                        that in both communiqué in Peking and in statement of principles in Moscow,
                        statement was included about noninterference in affairs other countries. If
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and Soviets did this, U.S. could
                        talk to them about violation of these principles. It is also possible that
                        because of the conflicts between them they would be less occupied in
                        subverting others. In any event, this was the time for others to strengthen
                        themselves, as Indonesia was doing.</p>
                    <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> commented that
                        Indonesian relations with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had not been
                        normalized because <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> continued to
                        interfere in Indonesian affairs with slander and support for Indonesian
                        Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). Secretary asked
                        whether their attacks on Indonesia had not been somewhat reduced lately.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said they were
                        relatively less but continued. Secretary commented that we, too, hope for
                        continued improvement in our relations with <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                            >PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>25. Noting that U.S. doing all it could to encourage American investors,
                        Secretary inquired about Indonesia's attitude toward foreign investment.
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said there was no
                        change. He went on to say that Indonesia had to protect and reserve for
                        domestic capital those fields where Indonesians had capability. Secretary
                        expressed understanding. He said it important that whatever done in this
                        field it be successful. U.S. did not want to encourage any foreign
                        investment that would become an irritant. It was important to work out rules
                        before rather than after private foreign entrepreneur invested. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said that basic principles,
                        including foreign investment law, unchanged but that Indonesia would have to
                        insure that investments were not detrimental to Indonesia and were really in
                        Indonesia's interest.</p>
                    <p>26. Secretary mentioned <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program and
                        regretted that it had been reduced slightly in past year. He said we had
                        asked for more this year and he was sure that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would work out some way, over long
                        run, to do what we had said we would do and which we both agreed we should
                        do.</p>
                    <p>27. Secretary was pressed by time to leave at this point. <persName
                            corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed his thanks and sent

                    <p>These are very good. The Indonesians are grateful for the military and
                        economic help which we have given them, and believe that we can be relied
                        upon to continue this help. They would like increased military assistance,
                        but have accepted the fact that Congressional cuts have imposed some
                        restrictions. They welcome American investment in Indonesia. They do not
                        wish to see a precipitate U.S. withdrawal from Asia. They are anxious to
                        develop Asian regional military cooperation as the U.S. military role
                        diminishes, and would like our help to this end. The President and President

                        President, he also asked for assurances that we would continue to provide

                        to Indonesian economic development. The President's reply in effect agreed;
                        he said that we would keep this very much in mind and would contribute at a

                        Indonesians have now asked for $750 million, only 3% over that of last year,
                        and we anticipate no trouble in providing a one-third share.</p>
