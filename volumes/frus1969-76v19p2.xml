                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, extablished a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: The <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the

                        Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R. Ford</persName>.
                    The subseries presents a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of both Presidents. This volume, which documents U.S. policy toward
                    Japan from 1969 until 1972, is Part 2 of a <pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"
                    />larger volume that was to have included a compilation on U.S. bilateral
                    relations with Korea and Japan.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for <hi
                        rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, Volume XIX, Part 2</p>
                <p>The 1970s marked a rebalancing in the close relationship between the United
                    States and Japan, as the two countries responded to the phenomenal growth of
                    Japanese economic power and the necessity of a shift from Japanese dependence
                    toward mutual interdependence. Although President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Richard Nixon</persName> was well disposed toward Japan, the alliance would
                    sustain a number of blows during his first term in office. This was partly
                    because Japan was peripheral to the major foreign policy priorities of the Nixon
                    administration when it entered office—most notably the effort to reduce U.S.
                    involvement in the Vietnam War, the attempt to improve relations with the Soviet
                    Union, and the desire to explore a less hostile relationship with Communist
                    China. While pursuing these priorities, the administration showed a willingness
                    to take allies for granted as it attempted to broker agreements with U.S.
                    adversaries. Moreover, neither <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> nor
                    his chief foreign policy advisor, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName>, was particularly interested in international economic
                    issues, which were central to the U.S.-Japan relationship, but which they saw
                    primarily through the prism of Cold War diplomacy and domestic politics. Add to
                    this a contentious battle between the Japanese and U.S. textile industries, and
                    it becomes easier to understand the difficult condition reached in U.S.-Japan
                    relations during 1971, when the United States announced with little warning
                    dramatic shifts in policy towards Communist China and the international economy.
                    Following that period of instability, the remainder of this documentary
                    compilation records the efforts of officials in both countries to adapt the
                    relationship to changed political and economic circumstances.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration achieved the two
                    principal goals it set for itself regarding Japan. First, it reached an
                    agreement on the future status of Okinawa, which required placating both the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff, concerned that Okinawa not return to Japanese control at
                    the expense of the U.S. ability to meet its political and military obligations
                    in East Asia, and Japanese opinion, which contained powerful currents of
                    anti-militarist, anti-nuclear, and anti-U.S. sentiments. As would be expected,
                    the most important U.S. documentation on Okinawa reversion was produced by those
                    parts of the U.S. Government that specialized in issues of national security and
                    foreign policy. Second, with considerable effort, the administration reduced
                    Japan’s contribution to the growth of foreign textile imports into the United
                    States. This issue proved difficult to resolve in part because the textile
                    industry was politically influential in both countries, and both industries felt
                    increasingly <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>threatened by other low cost
                    textile producers. Much of the U.S. documentation about the textile dispute, as
                    well as other economic issues that affected U.S.-Japan relations, was produced
                    by or reflected the concerns of U.S. agencies such as the Departments of
                    Commerce and the Treasury that were primarily concerned with domestic and
                    international economic issues, although those parts of the bureaucracy primarily
                    focused on foreign policy were also involved.</p>
                <p>The preferred foreign policy methods of the Nixon administration likewise shaped
                    the documentation selected for this volume. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration’s fondness for back-channel negotiations
                    was sometimes matched on the Japanese side. Consequently, key initiatives in the
                    conduct of foreign policy on both sides during this period were not always
                    understood even by relevant cabinet secretaries, let alone their bureaucracies,
                    and the story of U.S.-Japanese relations cannot be adequately told without
                    access to records produced for the President by his aides. An additional tactic
                    favored by <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was “linkage,” whereby concessions
                    in one area could be used to gain advantages in another. Through the adoption of
                    these two practices, the United States and Japan secretly linked policies that
                    otherwise appeared disconnected. While such an approach possessed advantages, it
                    could also mean that government bureaucracies and the public had not been
                    persuaded into accepting the views of top leaders. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> noted the problem of trying to convince bureaucrats to
                    support policies that “must seem pretty ridiculous to them” because the policies
                    only made sense in the context of secret agreements about which the bureaucrats
                    had been kept ignorant. (<ref target="#d39fn3">Footnote 3, Document 39</ref>)
                    This volume thus considers diplomacy across multiple issue areas—diplomatic,
                    military, and economic—and on two levels: relatively typical negotiations within
                    and between the governmental bureaucracies of Japan and the United States, and
                    occasional secret bargaining between the highest political authorities on both
                    sides.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The original
                    document is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other
                    notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and
                    printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical
                    documents in the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied
                    by the editors for each document in<pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>cluded
                    in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found
                    in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently
                    corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman
                    type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and
                    a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed by headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified by
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PMRPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (NARA) has custody of the Nixon Presidential historical
                    materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to
                    review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the
                    privacy rights of former Nixon White House officials, since these officials were
                    not given the opportunity to separate their personal materials from public
                    papers. Thus, the PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA
                    formally to notify the Nixon Estate and former Nixon White House staff members
                    that the agency is scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical
                    materials. The Nixon Estate and former White House staff members have 30 days to
                    contest the release of Nixon historical materials in which they were a
                    participant or are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations
                    require NARA to segregate and return to the creator of files private and
                    personal materials. All <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that
                    include materials from NARA’s Nixon Presidential Materials Project are processed
                    and released in accordance with the PRMPA.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nixon White House <hi rend="roman">Tapes</hi></p>
                <p>Access to the Nixon White House tape recordings is governed by the terms of the
                    Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act and an access agreement with
                    the Office of Presidential Libraries of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration and the Nixon Estate. In February 1971, President <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> initiated a voice-activated taping
                    system in the Oval Office of the White House, and, subsequently, in the
                    President’s Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp David, the Cabinet
                    Room, and White House and Camp David telephones. The audiotapes include
                    conversations of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> with
                    his Assistant for National Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName>, other White House aides, Secretary of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, other Cabinet officers, Members of
                    Congress, and key foreign officials. The clarity of the voices on the tape
                    recordings is often very poor, but the editor made every effort to verify the
                    accuracy of the transcripts produced here. Through the use of digital audio and
                    other advances in technology, the Office of the Historian has been able to
                    enhance the tape recordings and produce significantly more accurate transcripts.
                    The result is that some transcripts printed here may differ from transcripts of
                    the same conversations printed in previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes. Even more accurate transcripts, however, cannot
                    substitute for listening to the recordings. Readers are urged to consult the
                    recordings themselves for a full appreciation of those aspects of the
                    conversations that cannot be captured in a tran<pb n="VIII" facs="0009"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII"/>script, such as the speakers’ inflections and emphases
                    that may convey nuances of meaning, as well as the larger context of the
                    discussion.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2003 and was completed in
                    2017, resulted in the decision to withhold 1 document in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 3 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 4 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume, and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide an accurate and comprehensive account of the Nixon administration’s
                    policy toward Japan from 1969 until 1972.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Acknowledgments</p>
                <p>The editor wishes to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the Nixon
                    Presidential Materials Project of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (Archives II), at College Park, Maryland. The editor also wishes
                    to express gratitude to the Richard Nixon Estate for allowing access to the
                    Nixon presidential recordings and the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace for
                    facilitating that access. Thanks are due to the Historical Staff of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, who were helpful in arranging full access to files. John
                    Haynes of the Library of Congress was responsible for expediting access to the
                    Kissinger Papers. The editor was able to use the Kissinger Papers, including the
                    transcripts of telephone conversations, with the kind permission of <persName

                    thank Sandy Meagher for her valuable assistance in expediting the use of files
                    of the Department of Defense and David Keegan for shepherding the volume through
                    the Department of State declassification process.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State historians by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s indexed central
                    files for 1969-1972 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives
                    and Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Almost all
                    the Department’s decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which
                    the National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred

                    preserved at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda,
                    California, include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including
                    the National Security Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>), the
                    Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of

                <p>The Nixon Presidential Materials, at the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba
                    Linda, California, are the single most important source of documentation for

                <p>After the Nixon Presidential Materials Project, and the White House Central
                    Files, the Henry A. Kissinger papers located in the Manuscript Division of the
                    Library of Congress are of great importance. While the Kissinger Papers contain
                    copies of many of the most important items found in the Nixon Presidential
                    Materials Project, the chief advantage of these files is that they are well
                    organized and contain fewer materials on administrative matters of little value
                    to most researchers. The most useful parts of the Kissinger Papers are the
                    Chronological Files, Memoranda of Conversations, Memoranda for the President,
                    and a collection of documents organized by country under the Geopolitical Files
                    heading. The Kissinger papers also contain records of Kissinger’s telephone
                    conversations (telcons). Copies of the Kissinger telephone conversations are
                    also available at the National Archives and are open to the public. Another
                    useful item in the Kissinger Papers is a typed version of <persName

                        <p>267. 1. I had hour and one-half talk with Prime Minister yesterday on my
                            farewell call.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2"><persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">U.
                                    Alexis Johnson</persName> ended his mission as Ambassador to
                                Japan on January 15, 1969.</note> He went into considerable length
                            explaining difficulties with agriculture and his consequent regret that
                            they were not able to do more on agricultural offers during trade talks,
                            but with some time to work out their agricultural problems they will be
                            able to be much more forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>2. On Okinawa he again emphasized importance he attached to obtaining
                            some agreement this year. He said that he recognized pressure on new
                            administration of other problems and that it would probably take some
                            time before administration would be able to come to grips with Okinawa
                            problem. (He knew statements on Okinawa being made by “doves like
                            Reischauer and <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>” and
                            from which Japanese press and public were deriving much comfort did not
                            necessarily represent majority opinion in U.S.) He still hoped to make
                            visit to Washington “not earlier than November” and, if necessary,
                            perhaps it could be a little later. He very much hoped that
                            cabinet-level committee could be held in Japan during summer and that
                            this would give him opportunity to talk to Secretary <persName

                            cabinet-level meeting he hoped that <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> could visit Washington to

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>. He did not mention visit
                            by <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>. (Previously Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> had told me that he
                            had discouraged visit by <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> at
                            this time, as he did not feel <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            position sufficiently developed to make visit productive.)</p>
                        <p><pb n="2" facs="0033" xml:id="pg_2"/>3. With respect to timing of his
                            visit he said that while he was trying to lead public opinion in Japan
                            on Okinawa, he feared what effects might be on public opinion here of
                            incidents during general strike on Okinawa and adverse reactions to new
                            labor ordinance.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">On November 19, 1968, an
                                American B–52 bomber crashed on Okinawa, creating a rallying point
                                for opposition to the stationing of B–52s on the island. In early
                                January 1969, the Joint Struggle Council of the Council to Protect
                                the Lives of Okinawans announced plans for demonstrations and
                                sit-down strikes to begin on February 4 throughout Okinawa that
                                would interdict movement into and out of the U.S. Air Force Base at
                                Kadena, as well as block traffic on the major Okinawan highways. The
                                Military Workers Union (Zengunro) and the Okinawa Teachers
                                Association decided to participate in the strike after a new
                                Comprehensive Labor Ordinance (CLO) was issued on January 11, which
                                restricted union picketing, union political activities, and, some
                                felt, the activities of ordinary Okinawan citizens. Although the CLO
                                was to take effect on January 25, the Civil Administration of
                                Okinawa responded to widespread criticism by postponing the
                                effective date of the ordinance and consulating with interested
                                parties. The February 4 strike was called off, although some
                                demonstrations occurred. Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and
                                Research <persName corresp="#p_HTL_1">Thomas Hughes</persName> sent
                                an intelligence note discussing these events to Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> on February 3. (National

                                RYU IS.</note> There could also be other developments in Okinawa
                            during course of year that “could lead public opinion in unforeseen
                            directions” that could make his visit inappropriate in November, thus
                            for time being he wanted to remain flexible on a possible date.</p>
                        <p>4. Taking advantage of his mention of “gap” between Japan’s and U.S.
                            public opinion, I said I entirely agreed and was very concerned over
                            what I felt were the growing adverse trends in U.S. opinions towards
                            Japan. I said that in part, because of sensationalized news and TV
                            coverage of small minority group demonstrations in Japan against our
                            bases, etc., there was growing feeling that Japan was economically “fat
                            and happy,” financially profiting from our sacrifices in Vietnam, while
                            seeking to expel us from our bases in both Japan and Okinawa. I said
                            that growing reaction to this among many Americans was, if Japan wants
                            us to get out why don’t we. I knew that this did not represent majority
                            or government opinion in Japan, but this was not getting across to
                            American people. Under these circumstances, I was sure that there would
                            be very adverse reaction in U.S. simply “to giving back Okinawa to
                            Japan.” Thus I thought it important that <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> find better context in which to present problem to us
                            and suggested that one possible means was to present question in terms
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>’s willingness to undertake
                            increased defense responsibilities, by accepting same kind of immediate
                            defense mission in the Ryukyus after reversion, as it now accepted in
                            Japan proper. This was apart from conditions with respect to our bases
                            in Okinawa, which involved whether our bases there were to be
                            “effective.” In this connection I, of course, discussed the whole
                            question of graduated deterrence and the necessity of paying attention
                                <pb n="3" facs="0034" xml:id="pg_3"/>to how Pyongyang and Peking
                            might interpret whatever we did. I also discussed necessity of getting
                            away from present context in which Japan thought it was doing us a favor
                            by permitting us to be here, and instead putting across to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and American people sense that Japan
                            valued and wanted our presence.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> received all this in good
                            spirit and said that even <gloss target="#t_JDA_1">JDA</gloss> and “his
                            own officer” lacked sophistication in military matters. To astonishment
                            of Hori (Chief Cabinet Secretary) and Togo, who were also present, he
                            said that <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>’s “three nuclear
                            principles” (non-possession, non-production and non-introduction) were
                            “nonsense.” However, this should not be interpreted to mean Japan wants
                            to have nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>6. In response to probing me whether there was a split between military

                        <p rend="flushleft">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. The next year or two will be critical for the US-Japanese security
                            relationship. Japanese national elections must be held this year or
                            next. In addition to domestic questions, the issues will include
                            continuation of the Security Treaty, reduction of the numbers of US
                            bases in the Japanese home islands, the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese
                            administration, and subsequent US use of the bases on Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>B. The problems relating to Okinawa are the most immediate. If Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is unable to obtain
                            an agreement in 1969 which <pb n="5" facs="0036" xml:id="pg_5"/>provides
                            for reversion of Okinawa to Japanese administration in the course of the
                            early 1970’s, his own political position will be seriously damaged and
                            the position of the ruling party will probably suffer to some extent. In
                            such circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> or any
                            successor would take a stiffer line with the US on security issues.
                            There would be increasing pressure to reduce the US base structure in
                            Japan itself. In Okinawa, there would be a sustained and increasingly
                            bitter local agitation against US civil control and the US military
                            presence.</p>
                        <p>C. Assuming agreement on the issue of Okinawan reversion, the problem of
                            bases in Japan will probably not offer major difficulties. In
                            negotiations on the use of bases in Okinawa after reversion, we expect
                            the Japanese to press for the same rules as apply to the US bases in
                            Japan. On the question of “prior consultation” concerning conventional
                            military uses, we believe that a mutually acceptable solution could
                            probably be worked out, and on better terms for the US than now apply to
                            the use of US bases in Japan. We believe that it would be much more
                            difficult politically for <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to
                            agree to nuclear rights for the US on Okinawa after reversion.</p>
                        <p>D. Japan’s leaders view the Security Treaty as part of a complex
                            bilateral relationship which has proven highly advantageous to Japan for
                            almost two decades. Despite Japan’s growing economic strength and
                            nationalism, the Japanese people show no enthusiasm for the financial
                            burdens and political costs of a large military buildup. For the next
                            few years at least, the Japanese leadership sees no alternative to
                            continued reliance on the US nuclear umbrella and the Security
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>1. The next two years are going to be critical ones for Japan. In this
                            period, security relations with the US as well as the Security Treaty
                            itself will be under intensive re-examination, and, from the left, under
                            attack. The future status of Okinawa will be an increasingly urgent and
                            even more sensitive issue. National elections are mandatory by January
                            1971 and, according to custom, Premier <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Eisaku Sato</persName> should relinquish his office to a successor
                            by December 1970. Jockeying for the succession will be going on
                            throughout this period. All these events tend to become intricately
                            interwoven; moreover, they will occur over a period in which the
                            international situation may be in flux, not only because of developments
                            in Vietnam, but as a consequence of possible shifts in Chinese policies
                            and in those of the US as well.</p>
                        <p>2. The situation invites comparison with 1960 when Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>, though successful in
                            accomplishing Diet ratification of the Security Treaty, was forced by
                            internal party pressures to resign in the wake of massive and violent
                            leftist demonstrations against his policies <pb n="6" facs="0037"
                                xml:id="pg_6"/>and widespread public displeasure with some of his
                            political methods. The affair led to a generally more cautious Japanese
                            posture in security relations with the US and, for a time, cast doubt on
                            the viability of the US military base structure in Japan.</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> wants to
                            avoid a repetition of the kind of thing that happened in 1960. He has
                            decided to avoid the problems inherent in any attempt to renegotiate the
                            terms of the treaty and, instead, to permit its continued application
                            for an indefinite period.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">The “Treaty of
                                Mutual Cooperation and Security” between the US and Japan became
                                effective on 23 June 1960; its term is indefinite but, after 10
                                years, either side may terminate it upon one year’s notice.
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Japan’s leftist forces have
                            responded predictably with plans for a yearlong campaign against the
                            government on the treaty and related security issues. Under Japanese
                            political ground rules, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            would invite serious trouble if he tried forcibly to prevent the
                            demonstrations which seem certain to occur. He has been attempting,
                            therefore, to handle security relations with the US in a way calculated
                            to deny additional support to his leftist opponents and to maintain
                            domestic acceptance of his own foreign policy positions. He hopes, by
                            projecting an image of reasonableness in dealing with his domestic
                            opponents and one of firmness in future dealings with the US, to get
                            through the next two years without serious damage to his own political
                            stature, to the position of his party, or to the overall Japanese
                            relationship with the US.</p>
                        <p>4. Whether or not <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will be
                            successful depends on many things, including some matters over which
                            neither he nor Japan may have much control. But two factors will be of
                            overriding importance: his domestic political position in general, and
                            his ability to handle outstanding issues between the US and Japan,
                            particularly Okinawa and other security problems.</p>
                        <p>II. THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION</p>
                        <p>5. The position of the Sato government appears secure at this time. His
                            Liberal-Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>) holds a
                            solid 57 percent majority of the seats in the all-important lower house
                            of the National Diet, and new elections could be delayed as late as
                            January 1971. Perhaps more significant, support for <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> within the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> itself has been reaffirmed as recently
                            as November 1968, when he easily won his third two-year term as party
                            president.</p>
                        <p>6. A fundamental source of strength for the Sato government at this
                            juncture is the generally good economic situation. The seemingly endless
                            Japanese boom has brought full employment and improved living standards

                            riots. Despite persistent criticism of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1"
                                >LDP</gloss> for failure to provide adequately for social welfare
                            and similar needs, conservative leadership in Japan has become
                            identified in the public mind with the national prosperity.</p>
                        <p>7. The fortunes of the main opposition party, the Socialists (<gloss
                                target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss>), who hold 29 percent of the lower
                            house seats, are at their lowest ebb in years. Wedded to Marxist dogma
                            and preoccupied with factional rivalries, the Socialist leadership has
                            consistently failed to enunciate realistic alternatives to <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> policies, and popular support for the
                            party is slowly diminishing. Indeed, the Japanese left generally is in
                            considerable disarray, split into many segments over issues ranging from
                            the Sino-Soviet dispute to student militancy at home. Even in the
                            struggle against the Security Treaty, effective cooperation among the
                            various leftist parties and organizations has become difficult to
                            achieve. The Socialist campaign plan, for example, provides no formal
                            role for the Communists (<gloss target="#t_JCP_1">JCP</gloss>). For its
                            part, the <gloss target="#t_JCP_1">JCP</gloss>, with a persistent one
                            percent of the Diet representation, is engaged in a searching
                            reappraisal of its part in Japanese political life. Preoccupied with
                            this reappraisal and fearful of bringing on government suppression, the
                            Communists have become much less willing than before to provoke the
                            government in the streets.</p>
                        <p>8. Despite these weaknesses of the left, the principal short-term
                            challenge to the stability of the Sato government will nonetheless be
                            leftist efforts to capitalize on public discontent with regard to
                            various security-related issues. They will also seek to exploit the
                            growing sense of independence and nationalism. As in the past, there
                            will probably be attempts by the <gloss target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_JCP_1">JCP</gloss> to disrupt normal legislative
                            business in the Diet, coupled with sporadic strike action by their union
                            affiliates. But the major leftist pressures will probably be generated
                            in the larger cities where demonstrators, spearheaded by leftist labor
                            unions and by militant students, will try to overwhelm the police and to
                            damage or seize public buildings. There may also be attempts to storm
                            some of the many scattered US military installations in the country. The
                            objective would be to create a situation sufficiently threatening or
                            chaotic to induce the resignation of the Sato ministry. Many leftist
                            leaders probably have little expectation of ousting <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> by their violent tactics, much
                            less of terminating the Security Treaty. To them, the treaty and related
                            security issues are important mainly as they provide opportunities for
                            intensifying and expanding their long-term challenge to the Japanese
                            “establishment.”</p>
                        <p>9. These issues are particularly well-suited to leftist political needs
                            because they offer hope of attracting support from Japan’s rising
                            non-Marxist parties, the Democratic Socialists (<gloss target="#t_DSP_1"
                                >DSP</gloss>) and the Komeito, the political arm of the militantly
                            nationalistic Buddhist movement, Soka <pb n="8" facs="0039"
                                xml:id="pg_8"/>Gakkai. (The <gloss target="#t_DSP_1">DSP</gloss> and
                            the Komeito each controls five to six percent of the lower house seats.)
                            The <gloss target="#t_DSP_1">DSP</gloss>, for want of feasible
                            alternatives, has long maintained a foreign policy position only a shade
                            to the left of the government. The Komeito, however, is moving rapidly
                            to profit from rising Japanese nationalism by urging greater
                            independence of the US. Its positions on security issues increasingly
                            resemble those of the <gloss target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_JCP_1">JCP</gloss>, though it stops short of demanding
                            immediate abolition of the Security Treaty. These combined pressures
                            have begun to influence the <gloss target="#t_DSP_1">DSP</gloss>
                            leadership to contemplate a similar reorientation. Even some of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> rivals are beginning to view the
                            situation as a fruitful source of political ammunition with which to
                            dislodge him or, more realistically, to prevent him from naming one of
                            his close associates as successor.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3"><persName

                        <p>10. Barring <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s resignation as
                            a consequence of leftist-generated pressures, he will probably face the
                            voters once more before he retires. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s present plan, if he is first successful in
                            reaching a satisfactory agreement with the US on the Okinawa issue, is
                            to call for lower house elections in advance of the obligatory date of
                            January 1971—perhaps late this year or early in 1970. He would be
                            seeking to capitalize on his handling of the sensitive Okinawa issue
                            and, in the process, to gain a mandate for his policy of continuing the
                            Security Treaty. If he failed in 1969 to secure what he believed to be a
                            satisfactory agreement, elections would probably be postponed until some
                            time later in 1970 and would have to be fought on the issues both of
                            Okinawa and the Security Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s failure in the meantime to score success on the

                        <p>11. In the first set of circumstances—a 1969 or early 1970 election
                            following a satisfactory Okinawa settlement—<persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> would almost
                            certainly retain a comfortable edge in the lower house. If the election
                            were held while Okinawa problems remained unsettled, either in 1969 or
                            1970, the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> would probably sustain
                            significant losses. These would almost certainly not be heavy enough to
                            overturn the conservative majority in the lower house, but the setback
                            might be of sufficient proportions to cause <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> to relinquish control of the party and thus lead to

                            ran third. These two men and most other potential candidates <pb n="9"
                                facs="0040" xml:id="pg_9"/>from outside the Sato wing of the party
                            are committed to a more independent posture toward the US and a more
                            flexible attitude toward Peking. If one of them became prime minister,
                            it would almost certainly be harder for the US to deal with the Japanese
                            on security issues, though they would not necessarily become
                            antagonistic toward general US political objectives in East Asia. And to
                            the extent that Okinawa remained unsettled and an issue of public
                            controversy in Japan, any successor to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>—whether named by him or otherwise chosen—would take
                            a stiffer line with the US on security issues.</p>
                        <p>13. It can be argued that US preoccupation with security issues has led
                            American observers to exaggerate the potential impact of these issues on
                            Japanese elections. In past elections, personal qualities of the
                            candidates have probably been the single most important factor, domestic
                            issues second, and foreign affairs generally not of critical
                            significance to the outcome. This situation was rooted in the general
                            apathy of the populace toward international issues, the extraordinarily
                            slow revival of nationalism in postwar Japan, and the absence of a
                            non-Marxist opposition party willing to oppose essential elements of the
                            US alliance. We believe that this situation is changing, however, and
                            that the new assertiveness we have begun to observe in Japan’s
                            international dealings will be increasingly reflected in the attitudes
                            and actions of the Japanese electorate.</p>
                        <p>III. JAPANESE SECURITY PROBLEMS AND THE US ALLIANCE</p>
                        <p>A. The Security Treaty</p>
                        <p>14. A major problem in the US-Japanese security relationship is that most
                            Japanese and their leaders do not perceive any direct military threat to
                            their security at this time. There is suspicion of Soviet ambitions in
                            Northeast Asia and official displeasure with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s continued occupation of a few
                            small islands northeast of Hokkaido. Nevertheless, the Japanese
                            generally believe that the Soviets will maintain friendly relations in
                            hope of ultimately weaning Japan from the US alliance, preventing a
                            close Japanese relationship with Peking, and keeping open the
                            possibility of a greatly expanded Soviet-Japanese economic relationship.
                            In any case, few Japanese anticipate any resort to force by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the area.</p>
                        <p>15. While there is some concern in the Japanese Government over China’s
                            recent progress in the development of nuclear weapons and strategic
                            missiles, there is little apprehension among Japanese in general about a
                            Chinese military threat, certainly not one to Japan. Such concern as
                            there may be in official quarters over the potentialities of China’s
                            massive ground forces is offset by the absence of respect for its air
                            and sea forces. Some years hence, of course, as China further develops
                            its capabilities for strategic warfare, these attitudes may change. At
                                pres<pb n="10" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_10"/>ent, such concern as
                            there is in Japan over a Chinese military threat is chiefly in terms of
                            the possibility of war between China and the US in which Japan might
                            somehow become involved. This accounts in large part for the sensitivity
                            of the Japanese to US military actions in Southeast Asia which might
                            conceivably provoke Peking to fight, and to an even greater concern on
                            their part whenever their appears danger of war in Korea.</p>
                        <p>16. Nevertheless, the leaders of Japan feel the need for a powerful
                            military protector. Unarmed neutralism, a popular concept in early
                            postwar Japan, presently has little support. The Japanese leadership and
                            much of the populace recognize the perils of such a policy in the
                            volatile East Asian environment. Although the concept of neutralism
                            founded on a strong, nuclear-armed, and independent Japanese military
                            establishment is developing some appeal, the political and economic
                            obstacles to it would be formidable. A decision to go nuclear would
                            imply vastly increased military expenditures and require a substantial
                            change in the domestic political climate. In addition, the Japanese
                            believe that a substantial military buildup by them would cause mistrust
                            among the non-Communist nations of East Asia and sharpen the hostility
                            of the Communist states, all to the detriment of Japan’s long-range
                            interests in the region. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the Japanese
                            would opt for armed neutrality under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>17. Given the need for a protector, the Japanese prefer to see the US in
                            this role. But the value of the alliance for many Japanese lies almost
                            entirely in the nuclear umbrella provided by the US. They tend to look
                            upon the US base structure and US military privileges in Japan and
                            Okinawa as concessions granted in a different era and, with some
                            exceptions, intended to serve American interests in areas sometimes
                            remote from Japan. Many Japanese leaders take a different view.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and other conservative
                            leaders believe a strong US military position in Northeast Asia to be of
                            benefit to Japan, at least until it is prepared to participate more
                            fully in its own defense.</p>
                        <p>18. Japanese leaders have never pressed for the abrupt removal of the US
                            bases or the immediate and unconditional return of Okinawa. They have
                            accepted the existing situation because they do not want to jeopardize
                            the treaty with the US and the security commitment it affords, and
                            because they see the US alliance as an essential component in a complex
                            of relationships—political and economic—which have proven highly
                            advantageous to Japan for almost two decades. Indeed, the economic
                            relationship in which the US consistently accounts for some 30 percent
                            of Japan’s trade is at least as compelling as Japan’s security
                            requirements in guaranteeing its continued desire to align itself with
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>19. It is possible, of course, that Japanese leaders are quietly planning
                            for the day when their own forces, equipped with nuclear and <pb n="11"
                                facs="0042" xml:id="pg_11"/>conventional weapons of Japanese
                            manufacture, could defend the country without US assistance. For a good
                            many Japanese military men, and some civilian strategists as well, this
                            is clearly the preferred course. Their influence, however, has so far
                            been slight and the Japanese defense buildup continues to be an
                            extremely slow affair. Every indication is that current Japanese defense
                            planning is premised on the expectation that US air and naval forces
                            will for years to come provide for the strategic defense of Japan, while
                            indigenous forces play a defensive role in the neighborhood of Japan
                            itself. Japanese military planners hope eventually to develop air, sea,
                            and ground forces capable of holding an attacking force in check until
                            major US support becomes available. If and when the Japanese do develop
                            such capabilities, they would probably anticipate the virtual
                            elimination of the US military presence in Japan. But the process of
                            building even these forces would require many years and, in any case,
                            would not eliminate the need for nuclear protection.<note n="4"

                                control of the Japanese Government, the program of increased
                                national military strength suggested here might not be pursued. But
                                it seems unlikely that any potential successor regime would abandon
                                the effort to maintain some kind of program for a Japanese military

                        <p>20. The prospect of indefinite dependency on the US is obviously galling
                            to Japanese nationalists of all political colorations. But for want of a
                            viable alternative, as well as for the positive advantages the Security
                            Treaty provides, the leaders of Japan are willing to accept its
                            continued application. To say this, however, is not to say that they are
                            content to see present arrangements continue without some changes or
                            adjustments. In the long run, such sentiments will probably lead to more
                            serious consideration of “armed neutrality” by the Japanese leadership,
                            and this process would be accelerated if faith in the US alliance were
                            somehow shaken.</p>
                        <p>21. There is no indication that the Japanese are now planning for the
                            production of nuclear weapons, though they have the capability to build
                                them.<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (16

                            next few years to develop such weapons. In addition to various economic
                            and technological obstacles, the Japanese would have to circumvent
                            numerous international safeguards on certain nuclear materials.
                            Moreover, the Japanese nuclear allergy shows few signs of weakening
                            despite efforts by <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and
                            others to encourage a less emotional approach to the matter. Even if the
                            Japanese ratify the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, they are not
                            necessarily foreclosing the option to develop nuclear weapons systems.
                            In charting their course on the issue, <pb n="12" facs="0043"
                                xml:id="pg_12"/>they will be acutely sensitive to any reduction in
                            the credibility of US nuclear protection.</p>
                        <p>B. The Bases Issue</p>
                        <p>22. Until recently, the presence of US bases in Japan was a greater
                            irritant in US-Japanese relations than the Okinawa reversion problem.
                            The bases are visible and the problems associated with their use are
                            more immediate to the Japanese, their Diet representatives, and their
                            local officials. Near airfields, there is frustration over persistent
                            noise and radio and television interference, as well as fear of aircraft
                            crashing into populated areas. Complaints of electronic interference are
                            also a problem near many US facilities. Ammunition depots and gunnery
                            ranges cause concern over personal safety in adjacent land and sea
                            areas. In the rapidly growing suburbs of large urban areas, particularly
                            Tokyo, there is resentment on the part of private and municipal
                            interests desiring to acquire valuable home, farm, or factory sites.
                            And, of course, given the Japanese nuclear phobia, visits by
                            nuclear-powered US naval vessels can lend themselves to exploitation by
                            Japanese critics of the security relationship with the US. Finally,
                            there is widespread sentiment in Japan against the presence of foreign
                            troops and concern in base areas over such related problems as
                            miscegenation and the morals of youth.</p>
                        <p>23. Though the Sato government occasionally opens conversations with the
                            US on base issues chiefly in response to public outcries, Japan’s
                            conservative leadership is nonetheless genuinely desirous of reducing
                            the US military presence. In line with political realities and in
                            recognition of deep-seated Japanese yearnings for greater international
                            stature and independence of action, the leadership has virtually
                            committed itself to a program of progressive though gradual reduction of
                            US bases during the 1970’s. Eventually, the leaders would like to see
                            the US retain only those bases which they themselves consider important
                            for the protection of Japan and Japanese security interests in Northeast
                            Asia from the threat of Chinese or Soviet attack or nuclear blackmail.
                            These include, for example, the naval bases at Sasebo and Yokosuka, and
                            the airbase at Misawa in northern Honshu. The conservatives do not
                            necessarily wish to close down all the other US bases. They are
                            focussing on those like the Itazuke Air Base near Kyushu University
                            which have become tremendous political liabilities, and on recreational
                            and training facilities situated on valuable acreage which they consider
                            marginal to the US military mission in Japan. Some US installations are
                            also being sought for the use of the Japanese armed forces, or for
                            maintenance on a standby basis, perhaps under some sort of joint-use
                            option. In this way, too, the further expansion of Japan’s forces could
                            more easily be justified to the public.</p>
                        <p><pb n="13" facs="0044" xml:id="pg_13"/>24. During 1968, popular pressures
                            for a reduction of the US military presence grew in consequence of a
                            series of incidents: several aircraft mishaps (particularly the crash of
                            a jet fighter in Kyushu), alleged nuclear pollution of Sasebo harbor,
                            and the opening of a new US military hospital in downtown Tokyo. Upon
                            the request of the Japanese Government, the US agreed in late 1968 to
                            reduce its military installations and facilities from about 150 to about
                            100. Japanese critics contend, however, that most of the facilities to
                            be surrendered are minor ones, and pressures for additional reductions
                            are strong. This persistent public attitude will require <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to exercise great tact in handling
                            base-related problems and to show some forward movement in dealings with
                            the US on such issues. But barring some new calamity at a US base,
                            popular opinion will probably be more influenced by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s manner of handling the base
                            issue than by the substance of particular solutions. In the longer term,
                            however, with nationalism on the upsurge and the centrist parties
                            increasingly pitching their appeals to the electorate on the bases
                            issue, the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> will probably feel
                            compelled to increase its demands on the US and to enunciate them more
                            positively.</p>
                        <p>C. Okinawa</p>
                        <p>25. In the immediate future, the Okinawa issue is likely to prove the
                            most urgent and troublesome of all the US-Japanese security problems.
                            The issue includes both the question of reversion to Japanese
                            administration and questions about US military use of the island. As to
                            the first, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has committed
                            himself before the electorate to obtaining from the US in 1969 a firm
                            timetable for the subsequent reversion of Okinawa to Japanese
                            administration. He has publicly implied that the US agreed to this
                            procedure at the time of his official visit to Washington in late 1967.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s problems have been
                            increased by the election in November 1968 of Chobyo Yara as Chief
                            Executive of the Ryukyus. Yara, who handily defeated a conservative
                            opponent backed by the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>, campaigned
                            on a platform which demanded immediate reversion of the Ryukyus, the
                            exclusion of nuclear weapons from the islands, and the progressive
                            reduction of the US military presence. Yara’s election is seen by the
                            Japanese as a clearcut indication that the majority of Okinawans desire
                            an end to the US occupation. The leftists have pounced on the issue,
                            while the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> leadership has been
                            seeking refuge in <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s earlier
                            pronouncements and in a host of quasi-official proposals for achieving
                            prompt reversion.</p>
                        <p>26. Another source of pressure for reversion is the assumption in Japan
                            that the end of the Vietnamese war will greatly diminish US demands on
                            the Okinawan military complex. Many also believe that the development of
                            new strategic weapons by the US has considerably <pb n="14" facs="0045"
                                xml:id="pg_14"/>reduced its need for Okinawan bases, particularly
                            for any deployment of nuclear weapons. Such arguments are most often
                            used by conservative critics of the US position on the island. Another
                            argument, which is put forward by the leftists, is that the dismantling
                            of the Ryukyu base structure will assure Peking of Japan’s good
                            intentions and open the way for a more fruitful relationship. But this
                            argument carries little weight in other circles.</p>
                        <p>27. The <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> government wants to
                            open meaningful negotiations with the US on Okinawa soon. The Japanese
                            scenario calls for a succession of high-level US-Japanese meetings
                            during the spring and summer of 1969, after which <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> himself would come to Washington
                            in the fall to achieve a final agreement. The Japanese negotiating
                            position is not entirely clear, at least at this stage. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> himself would probably be
                            satisfied with an agreement that set a firm date for a Japanese
                            administrative takeover in the not too distant future—e.g., two or three
                            years hence. He personally would be more than willing to defer the
                            highly sensitive and less tractable issues respecting US use of the
                            Okinawan bases.</p>
                        <p>28. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will, however, be under
                            considerable domestic political pressure to move beyond his personal
                            inclinations and to put forward additional demands concerning Okinawa.
                            For example, there are widespread pressures in both Okinawa and Japan
                            for reversion at “homeland level”—i.e., applying the same rules to US
                            use of Okinawan bases as apply to those in the home islands. These
                            include a US obligation to engage in “prior consultation” with the
                            Japanese Government on any changes in the equipment of US forces in
                            Japan, which is taken to mean nuclear weapons. A second requirement is
                            to hold “prior consultation” in the case of combat operations launched
                            from US bases in Japan against areas outside of Japan. Moreover, the US
                            has agreed that “prior consultation” means “prior agreement.”</p>
                        <p>29. We cannot be sure precisely how <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> will maneuver between his own preferences, Japanese
                            domestic pressures, and US positions. We expect that he will feel
                            compelled to press hard for the exclusion from Okinawa of the nuclear
                            weapons which virtually all Japanese believe are stored there. He would
                            seek a US commitment for their exclusion at the time of reversion,
                            though he might settle for some such commitment tied to a later date,
                            preferably not too distant. On the issue of “prior consultation”
                            concerning US conventional military use, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> can probably afford to be much more flexible,
                            particularly if tensions in Southeast Asia were to subside during 1969
                            and if the B–52s were meanwhile removed from Okinawa. The presence of
                            these aircraft on the island, especially in what appears to be a direct
                            combat role over Southeast Asia, has been a source of political
                            difficulty to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> at home and,
                            on Okinawa, the issue has been sharpened by the <pb n="15" facs="0046"
                                xml:id="pg_15"/>November 1968 crash of one of these aircraft.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and other Japanese
                            leaders have a good reason for not pressing for “prior consultation” for
                            conventional military use; the absence of the “prior consultation”
                            formula would enable them to avoid political and diplomatic
                            responsibility for US military use of Okinawa in connection with any
                            conflicts in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>30. In the light of the various circumstances outlined above, we believe
                            that a failure by <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to achieve
                            an agreement with the US in 1969 which promised reversion of Okinawa to
                            Japanese administration in the course of the early 1970’s would be very
                            damaging to his political position, and the position of the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> would probably suffer to some extent.
                            Ultimately, these developments would adversely affect the US-Japanese
                            security relationship as a whole and cooperation on a variety of other
                            issues would also be impaired. Failure would also bring about greater
                            pressure to reduce the US base structure in Japan. In Okinawa, there
                            would be a sustained and increasingly bitter campaign of local agitation
                            against US civil authorities and the US military presence. Under these
                            conditions, Okinawa’s role in support of US forces in Southeast Asia and
                            Korea might be seriously impaired.</p>
                        <p>31. We are less certain of the impact of a failure by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to gain a US promise to exclude
                            nuclear weapons from Okinawa. Some kind of compromise formula on this
                            point, if coupled with a satisfactory agreement on reversion, might be
                            sufficient to enable <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to
                            overcome his critics at home, but we believe that this could entail
                            substantial political risk for him. On the question of “prior
                            consultation” for conventional military purposes, there are innumerable
                            variations and interpretations which could prove reasonably acceptable
                            to the majority of Japanese and to Okinawans as well.</p>
                        <p>D. Other Bilateral Issues</p>
                        <p>32. Security-related issues are likely to provide the major immediate
                            hurdles in US-Japanese relations, but over the longer range, there are
                            other potentially troublesome problems. For the next year or two,
                            differences on the question of relations with Communist China will
                            probably not be of sufficient magnitude to warrant harsh words or heavy
                            criticism on either side, at least at official levels. Over the longer
                            term, however, with the possibility of Peking’s return to a more
                            rational posture in its foreign relations as the Cultural Revolution
                            diminishes, with the Japanese increasingly seeking ways to assert their
                            independence of the US, and with such <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies as Canada, Italy, and Belgium moving toward
                            diplomatic relations with the Chinese, pressure will build in Tokyo for
                            a reappraisal of China policy. There will probably be renewed interest
                            in “bridge-building” to Peking and, to the extent that relations with
                            Communist China appear promising, the <pb n="16" facs="0047"
                                xml:id="pg_16"/>Japanese may show a gradually diminishing concern
                            over the political sensitivities of the Nationalist Chinese—despite
                            Japan’s considerable interests in Taiwan. Japan’s desire to assure
                            itself a leading position in Chinese markets and to influence Chinese
                            policies in the direction of moderation may lead the Japanese into
                            conflict with US efforts to discourage meddling by China along its
                            Southeast Asian borders. US efforts to enforce COCOM controls on the
                            shipment of strategic goods and technology to China (and North Korea as
                            well) might become increasingly difficult and unproductive.</p>
                        <p>33. Despite the intricate network of US-Japanese economic relationships,
                            there are only a few problems in this sphere which might cause
                            significant friction. The main one is almost certainly the question of
                            the import restrictions imposed by both. In the US view, Japan has been
                            very slow to liberalize its various formal and informal import
                            restrictions. Japan, for its part, seeks improved access to US textile,
                            steel, and chemical markets. Such problems are for the most part normal
                            between great trading nations. In this case, despite occasional
                            emotional overtones, they are unlikely to develop into major problems.
                            If the US should return to protectionist policies, which would invite
                            Japanese retaliation, there would be major adverse effects on the entire
                            range of US-Japanese relations. Similar trouble could result if US
                            private capital should begin to enter Japan on a scale and in a way
                            which hurts Japanese economic interests and arouses Japanese
                            xenophobia.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">IV. JAPAN’S PROSPECTIVE SECURITY ROLE IN EAST ASIA</p>
                        <p>34. As noted earlier, many of the problems in the US-Japanese security
                            relationship are rooted in Japan’s relatively relaxed appraisal of the
                            military threat from the Asian mainland. Another factor, at least at
                            present, is the relatively narrow scope of Japanese political interests
                            overseas. The Japanese have demonstrated little interest in gaining
                            political influence in Latin America and Africa. And their interests in
                            the Middle East and in the Asian subcontinent—India, Pakistan, and
                            Ceylon—are likely to remain strictly economic.</p>
                        <p>35. Even in East Asia, Japan is cautious in its political involvements,
                            though there is considerable variation in its attitudes toward Northeast
                            and Southeast Asia. South Korea is strategically and historically of
                            great importance to Japan. Japan has overtaken the US as the leading
                            trading partner of the Republic of Korea, and may soon take the lead as
                            a provider of economic assistance. [<hi rend="italic">less than 2 lines
                                not declassified</hi>] In official channels, there are quiet working
                            arrangements between Seoul and Tokyo on certain questions related to
                            defense, intelligence, and internal security. These ties will grow,
                            although traditional Korean distrust of the Japanese and Japanese
                            caution about military involvements in Korea will compel both
                            governments to move slowly.</p>
                        <p><pb n="17" facs="0048" xml:id="pg_17"/>36. Another limiting factor is a
                            division of opinion among leading Japanese as to the nation’s stake in
                            South Korea’s security. Many see Japan’s interests there as primarily
                            economic and would like to keep them so. Even some of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s adherents express an
                            unwillingness to risk involvement in what they see as a persistent and
                            dangerous quarrel between North and South. The problem is not pressing
                            in the view of the Japanese so long as they can rely on the US to defend
                            South Korea. In the event of another major Communist attack in Korea,
                            any conservative Japanese Government would choose to facilitate the US
                            military effort, but would probably not itself assume an active military
                            role, save in defense of home waters.</p>
                        <p>37. Taiwan also has strong historical ties to Japan, but there is much
                            less concern among the Japanese with any strategic significance it may
                            have for Japan. Perhaps the return of the Ryukyu Islands, which stretch
                            to within 75 miles of Nationalist Chinese territory, would lead to a
                            reappraisal of that island’s importance.</p>
                        <p>38. Japan’s political concern in Southeast Asia is growing but its
                            interests there are less compelling. Trade is important, but it amounts
                            to only about 10 percent of Japan’s total, and there is widespread
                            awareness in Japan that the region is not central to the nation’s
                            prosperity, either in terms of markets or raw material supplies.
                            Nevertheless, the Japanese recognize that events in Vietnam and
                            elsewhere in Southeast Asia could take a dangerous turn which might have
                            adverse consequences closer to Japan. At the same time, developments in
                            Southeast Asia will offer increasingly broad opportunities for the
                            prosperous Japanese to exert their influence, both in regional affairs
                            and within specific countries. There will be a persistent unwillingness,
                            however, to become deeply involved in the region’s political turbulence
                            lest such activity reawaken fears of Japanese domination and prejudice
                            commercial interests in the area. There is a deep-seated belief in Japan
                            that the answer to stability in Southeast Asia lies in economic
                            development. In any case, Japan will almost certainly continue to
                            consider security in the region to be primarily the responsibility of
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>39. Over the years, however, particularly as the power of the Chinese
                            grows, the Japanese will probably feel increasingly compelled to defend
                            their own economic interests and to compete with Peking for influence
                            among the nations of Southeast Asia. In the process, Japan may come to a
                            different view of its political role and security responsibilities in
                            the region. Any such change would cause the Japanese leaders to reassess
                            their country’s security relationships with the US. But such
                            reassessment, if it comes, is still some years off.</p>

                        <p>Okinawa is the most important U.S. military base system in the Western
                            Pacific. The availability of the Ryukyus, close to potential theaters of
                            operation, adds substantially to U.S. deterrence power in Asia and to
                            overall U.S. capability and flexibility in the Pacific at all times, but
                            especially in the early stages of an active military operation.</p>
                        <p>The value of the Ryukyu bases is enhanced by the absence of legal or
                            foreign country restrictions on free access to or use of the facilities.
                            The only restrictions on U.S. freedom of action in the Ryukyus are
                            political restraints imposed by the need for local acquiescence and
                            Japanese cooperation in continued U.S. administration of the bases.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have sent you a memorandum describing the main
                            military purposes of our bases in Okinawa. Essentially they are:</p>
                        <quote><p>(1) A close-in staging area and operational base permitting the
                                maintenance of dual capable (conventional and nuclear) ground and
                                    <pb n="19" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_19"/> air forces in readiness
                                for swift reaction in an arc stretching from Northeast to Southeast
                                Asia;</p>
                            <p>(2) A centrally located logistical complex and weapons storage base
                                which has a major mission in support of land, air and naval forces
                                operating in the Western Pacific;</p>
                            <p>(3) A hub of an extensive communications network in the
                            region.</p></quote>
                        <p>Reversion of Okinawa would not basically and adversely affect most of the
                            day-to-day military activities on Okinawa since these relate to
                            logistics and communications missions. The principal military activities
                            directly affected by reversion, if we applied the current ground rules
                            in Japan, are combat air sorties, such as the current B–52 operations
                            against Vietnam, and nuclear storage on Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The loss of Okinawan nuclear storage would degrade our nuclear
                            capabilities in the Pacific and reduce our flexibility, points of major
                            concern to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [<hi rend="italic">less than 3

                        <p>Effective use of Ryukyu bases has always depended on the acquiescence of
                            both Japan and the Ryukyus to continued U.S. administration of the area.
                            This we have had for several reasons:</p>
                        <quote><p>(1) The commitment in principle to reversion by every American
                                President since 1952;</p>

                                with continued American administration but have also served to whet
                                the appetite for reversion;</p>

                        <p>In the past two years, however, reversionist pressures have swelled. The
                            pressure for reversion comes now from Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and the local Ryukyuan leaders who
                            are responding both to strong local <pb n="20" facs="0051"
                                xml:id="pg_20"/>political pressures and to their own sense of
                            national pride. At the root of the reversion demand is the urge to
                            conclude prolonged foreign rule.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> made his first effort to
                            resolve the Okinawa issue in November 1967. During the talks at that
                            time with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> it
                            was agreed to keep the problem under joint and continuous review and to
                            express publicly U.S. “understanding” of the desire for reversion and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s interest in reaching
                            agreement within a few years on a date for reversion. Privately and most
                            confidentially, the Japanese were advised that, due to the U.S. 1968
                            election and Vietnam, the U.S. Government was unable to give an answer
                            on Okinawa before 1969 at the earliest and that there were both problems
                            of military (e.g. nuclear) requirements and Congressional opposition to
                            deal with. The Japanese Government accepted and fully understood this
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The real push for reversion has come in the past six months, reflecting a
                            growing public demand particularly in Okinawa but also in Japan. It is
                            now the avowed determination of the Sato Government, supported fully
                            both in Japan and the Ryukyus, to reach an agreement with us on the
                            future timing of reversion within 1969. 1969 has become a key date since
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is convinced the
                            reversion problem must be solved before the expected 1970 confrontation
                            over the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and a continued alliance
                            relationship with the U.S. The pressure for reversion is even more acute
                            in Okinawa and has been given major momentum by the election of a
                            left-wing Chief Executive in November 1968, despite major U.S. and
                            Japanese Government efforts to bolster up the conservative candidate. In
                            fact, the margin of Ryukyuan acquiescence necessary for effective use of
                            our bases has seriously eroded.</p>
                        <p>A decision not to move ahead with reversion in the near future would
                            therefore have major political costs and risks both in Japan and in
                            Okinawa. These costs are summed up in the latest National Intelligence
                            Estimate, concurred in by all agencies:</p>
                        <quote>“The problems relating to Okinawa are the most immediate. If Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is unable to obtain
                            an agreement in 1969 which provides for reversion of Okinawa to Japanese
                            administration in the course of the early 1970’s, his own political
                            position will be seriously damaged and the position of the ruling party
                            will probably suffer to some extent. In such circumstances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> or any successor would take a
                            stiffer line with the U.S. on security issues. There would be increasing
                            pressure to reduce the U.S. base structure in Japan itself. In Okinawa,
                            there would be a sustained and increasingly bitter local agitation
                            against U.S. civil control and the U.S. military presence.”<note n="2"

                        <p>Reversion under the present ground rules in Japan, the “homeland level”,
                            would definitely result in significant military costs to us. On the
                            other hand, the political pressures for reversion have now reached a
                            point where military costs are possible if we refuse to enter into
                            reversion negotiations with the Japanese. A case can be made that the
                            costs to effective use of our military bases in both Okinawa and Japan
                            may be less over the long run if we agree to negotiate now and use this
                            for leverage to gain special rights increasing our freedom to use our
                            bases in both Okinawa and Japan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiating Issues: Minimizing the Military Costs
                            of Reversion</p>
                        <p>The following negotiating issues will require resolution before we can
                            finally agree to reversion:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Nuclear Storage</hi></p>
                        <p>The toughest negotiation issue will be the right to continued nuclear
                            storage on Okinawa. Current Japanese Government policy, supported very
                            broadly through the country, is to bar nuclear weapons of either
                            Japanese or U.S. origin from Japanese soil. The likelihood is that the
                            Japanese Government will seek full withdrawal of nuclear weapons from
                            Okinawa because the political costs of any other action would be too
                            prohibitive to risk.</p>
                        <p>There is a slim possibility that the Japanese Government might agree to
                            continued nuclear storage, at least for an interim period. If they did,
                            the anticipated broad public dissatisfaction with this decision leaves
                            very serious doubts whether the Diet will agree. Furthermore, in the
                            very slim possibility that Japanese agreement to nuclear storage is
                            obtained, we must recognize that the Japanese proponents of this
                            position view this as the opening wedge for an independent Japanese
                            nuclear force.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff currently favor seeking continued nuclear
                            storage in Okinawa. Other agencies are not in agreement although
                            recognizing the consequent degradation in our nuclear capabilities.</p>
                        <p>If we agree to withdraw nuclear weapons, there are several options short
                            of full storage which are negotiable with Japan:</p>

                                threat of nuclear hostilities in Asia but the arrangement would have
                                to be highly secret.</p>

                        <p>The present arrangements with Japan permit us freedom to conduct
                            conventional military operations from Japanese bases, without first <pb

                            extended to Okinawa following reversion. The U.S. military posture would
                            clearly be strengthened to the extent we could undertake other
                            conventional military operations without prior consultation with the
                            Japanese Government, particularly against Vietnam as long as the
                            hostilities continue. There are firm indications that at the present the
                            Japanese Government is prepared to go a good distance to meet this
                            requirement. Sustained military operations over an extended period,
                            however, would undoubtedly necessitate consulting the Japanese

                        <p>Our bases in Japan are currently subject to some inhibitions on which we
                            have clear Treaty rights. Given the crowded conditions on Okinawa, such
                            inhibitions could pose even greater problems for us there. A reversion
                            agreement should, therefore, encompass a much more positive posture on
                            the part of the Japanese Government to protect U.S. base rights.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Other Issues</hi></p>
                        <p>In addition to the major issues discussed above, there will be several
                            other points to be tied down before we agree to reversion. The most
                            important of these is assurance that Japan will meet most of the foreign
                            exchange and relocation costs of reversion and assure retention by the
                            U.S. of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> facilities on Okinawa
                            presently not covered by any U.S.-Japan agreement.</p>

                        <p>In negotiating with Japan we have three major cards to play:</p>
                        <quote><p>(1) The Japanese Government does not want and cannot afford to
                                push the reversion issue to the point of a major break with the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>(2) Our willingness to withdraw nuclear weapons from Okinawa provides
                                considerable bargaining leverage.</p>
                            <p>(3) Reversion, per se, particularly without nuclear weapons storage,
                                is a considerable political plum for the conservatives.</p></quote>
                        <p>The Japanese Government is not without its negotiating cards: The U.S.
                            has a strong interest in maintaining the current alliance relationship;
                            and pressures for reversion, particularly due to base incidents on
                            Okinawa, could get out of hand by design or even accidentally. It would
                            then be far more difficult to negotiate with an atmosphere of hostility
                            to our bases in Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The following negotiating tactics are proposed:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Phase 1:</hi> The new Ambassador to Japan should be
                            instructed to inform <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that
                            you are not adverse to reversion but are seriously concerned about its
                            military costs and the need to minimize the consequent concerns in the
                            U.S. and among our other allies. The Ambassador would enumerate to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> our reckoning of the
                            military costs of homeland level reversion and seek <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s views on how these could be
                            minimized by special arrangements, as well as the political problems he
                            faces. No direct hint would be given of our willingness to remove the
                            nuclear weapons.</p>

                        <p>In reply to questions by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, Togo commented on the Korean and Vietnamese
                            situations. On Korea, he personally felt that a stronger reaction to the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–121 shoot-down would have been
                            more effective in discouraging Kim Il Sung from further actions.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">On April 14 North Korean aircraft shot down a
                                U.S. Navy <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–121, an unarmed
                                reconnaissance plane carrying a crew of 31 men, over international
                                waters. No survivors were found.</note> On the other hand, he
                            understood the problems involved in undertaking a stronger military
                            reaction. On Vietnam, he said that the U.S. must hold on to the South
                            and remain there to assure an honorable settlement. He recognized that
                            given the problems of three divided countries in Asia, a strong military
                            posture on the part of the United States is necessary. This of course
                            relates to the Okinawan situation.</p>
                        <p><pb n="26" facs="0057" xml:id="pg_26"/>Togo described the current
                            Japanese position on Okinawa pointing out what was involved was a
                            reconciliation of the political problems in Japan with the military
                            needs. In particular, continued storage of nuclear weapons, beyond
                            emergency needs, was very difficult for the Japanese politically. On the
                            other hand, Japan could give the United States some flexibility on
                            conventional combat military operations. This could be done in advance
                            and within the framework of the current security treaty arrangements.
                            Japan wished to maintain these arrangements and not revise them. When
                            asked by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> how this
                            could be done, Togo suggested the process of advanced consultations on a
                            series of contingencies. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> commented that advance consultation would
                            associate Japan with a decision and that there might be advantages in
                            non-association with U.S. decisions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> has a sympathetic
                            understanding and interest in Japan and desires to resolve the Okinawan
                            issue and is giving it the fullest consideration. However, the nuclear
                            storage issue poses difficult problems for the United States and it is
                            hoped that this is understood in Japan. Furthermore, the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–121 incident demonstrated again the
                            crucial role played by our bases in Okinawa. This came out quite clearly
                            when we were considering alternative actions in response to the
                            shoot-down.</p>

                            an Interdepartmental Group paper on U.S. Policy toward Japan to

                            (Ibid.) The Treasury representative commented that “this paper does not

                            valuableʼ to the United States.” Instead, the Treasury representative
                            argued that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                            should pursue U.S. goals regarding balance of payments and trade in

                        <p>When Morton Halperin and <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Richard

                            the response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 5, they stated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_BWP_1">Bundy</persName>’s group had produced
                            “an excellent paper” that “can go to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss> essentially as it is.” The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss> staffers noted, however, that because the paper is
                            “quite long,” they had prepared a summary paper, which <persName

                            meetings. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> sent this paper to

                            participants agreed “that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                            should focus on Okinawa reversion as the most serious potentially
                            disruptive issue facing the US-Japan relationship and that decisions
                            were required in regard to the timing of reversion, U.S. nuclear storage
                            rights, and the right to undertake military combat operations in the
                            post-reversion period.”</p>
                        <p>They also decided that “the Security Treaty should be continued without
                            change . . . . We should reduce the base structure gradually to overcome
                            major political irritants while retaining essential base functions . . .
                            . We should continue to encourage moderate increases and qualitative
                            improvements in Japanese defense forces; Treasury preferred the option
                            of pressing for substantially larger defense forces. Economic issues
                            including trade and balance of payments, were an integral part of Japan
                            policy, but it would not be possible to address these fully at this
                            time.” (Talking paper for the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> Problem</p>
                        <p>During the next few years the U.S.-Japanese relationship will be severely
                            tested, particularly on two issues of potential confrontation: the
                            future status of Okinawa and continuation of the U.S.-Japan Security
                            Treaty beyond 1970. Decisions on U.S. policy are required not only on
                            these issues but on the fundamental nature of the U.S.-Japan
                            relationship and other major issues facing the two nations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Basic Relationship</p>
                        <p>The current cooperative partnership between the U.S. and Japan is based
                            on largely common security and economic interests. It has served
                            American interests reasonably well, particularly in the provision of
                            forward defense bases and the assurance that Japan’s actual and
                            potential power is primarily available to friendly, rather than hostile,
                            forces. The relationship, however, has its limitations. Japan, by
                            economic standards, is a major league power—but it has not behaved that
                            way and has not assumed the full measure of its regional and
                            international responsibilities. Japan is pointed in this direction,
                            driven in part by the rising force of nationalism; but it has been slow
                            to realize its potential; particularly in the assumption of security and
                            related responsibilities, due largely to political inhibitions, fears of
                            involvement in another war, and the high priority given to raising
                            living standards (Japan ranks 19th on a per capita income basis despite
                            Japan’s fantastic economic growth).</p>
                        <p>Japan has the capability to assume the full measure of its international
                            responsibilities over the next decade and has been moving in that
                            direction. The question facing the U.S. is whether Japan will reach this
                            goal soon enough for, and in a fashion consistent with, American
                            interests. There is the understandable view that Japan is now getting a
                            “free ride.” This view, in turn, raises the issue of alternatives to the
                            current relationship, namely: <hi rend="italic">disengagement</hi> or a
                                <hi rend="italic">full collective security <pb n="29" facs="0060"

                            could lessen the U.S. burden in Japan and East Asia.</p>
                        <p>The policy paper concludes that disengagement leading to a neutralist
                            Japan power center would be disadvantageous to U.S. interest, while a
                            full collective security relationship is not feasible given current
                            realities in Japan. The consideration of specific policy issues in the
                            remaining sections of the paper is therefore directed largely to means
                            of improving the present relationship and to dealing with the urgent
                            issues at dispute between the two nations.</p>

                        <p>There is agreement that the Treaty, which is both the keystone to the
                            total U.S.-Japan relationship and the basis for our security interests,
                            has served both U.S. and Japanese interests reasonably well. It has its
                            critics in both countries: in Japan, because the Treaty allies Japan to
                            the United States and involves the risk of involvement in a war; in the
                            United States, because the Treaty is a one-sided commitment to defend
                            Japan without a reciprocal Japanese commitment to U.S. defense or the
                            security of East Asia.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. has a major base structure in Japan, primarily for logistics and
                            communications. There are about 35,000 military personnel using 149
                            sites including two key naval bases and six airbases. The U.S. military
                            forces stationed in Japan are not directly concerned with the defense of
                            Japan as a primary mission. They primarily support operations elsewhere,
                            and would be particularly important in the event of a resumption of
                            Korean hostilities. The balance of payments cost of these bases was
                            about $570 million in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1968.</p>
                        <p>The bases have been subject to intermittent public pressure due to such
                            causes as noise, use of valuable urban property, accidents and <pb

                            warships. But efforts have been made to ease these problems and steadily
                            reduce the number of bases in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The three broad alternatives available, in addition to joint basing
                            arrangements, are:</p>

                            <p>3. Reduce the base structure rapidly to key naval and air bases with
                                emergency re-entry rights to others.</p></quote>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">IV.</hi> Okinawan Reversion</p>
                        <p>Okinawan reversion is the most serious and potentially disruptive issue
                            facing the United States and Japan. Okinawa houses the most important
                            U.S. military base system in the Western Pacific, capable of performing
                            a wide variety of functions. Its value is enhanced by the absence of any
                            legal restriction on American free access to or use of the bases, which
                            permits storage of nuclear weapons and the launching of military combat
                            operations directly from these bases.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, pressures in both Japan and Okinawa for reversion are
                            intense and growing. If progress is not made in 1969 on this question,
                            the position of the Sato Government and the ruling conservative party
                            would be seriously damaged and the acquiescence of the local Okinawan
                            population, essential to effective use of our bases, threatened.
                            Furthermore, if the Japanese and Okinawan public conclude that reversion
                            might be long delayed, U.S.-Japan relations would be seriously
                            prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>The issues to be decided are the timing of reversion, U.S. nuclear
                            storage rights, and the right to undertake military combat operations in
                            the post-reversion period. A full discussion of these issues is attached

                                1972 if negotiations are completed at that time.</p>
                            <p>2. Agree in 1969 to reversion and to enter into negotiations, with

                        <p>The optimum and obviously preferred military rights that the U.S. could
                            have following reversion would be a continuation of our current rights,
                            and the minimum, preferred by Japan, would be the same rights as are now
                            applied in Japan, the so-called “homeland level”.</p>
                        <p>The crucial military rights affected by reversion would be nuclear
                            storage and freedom for nuclear operations and the launching of
                            conventional combat operations. Both would require prior consultation
                            with Japan at the “homeland level.” Of these two, the nuclear weapons
                            issue is the most difficult in view of strong Japanese opposition.</p>

                        <p>The present arrangements with Japan do not permit freedom to conduct
                            conventional military combat operations from Japanese bases, without
                            first consulting with the Japanese Government, except in the event of an

                            event of an attack on Japan. This restriction would be automatically
                            extended to Okinawa following reversion unless some special arrangement
                            is agreed upon. In the absence of such special arrangements combat air
                            strikes and perhaps refueling B–52s by tanker aircraft and the launching
                            of combat amphibious or airborne operations would be forbidden unless

                        <p>There are indications at the present time that the Japanese Government is
                            prepared to go some of the way to preserve conventional military
                            operations rights, and in any event, any agreement must include ongoing

                        <p>The key policy issue is whether Japan’s present defense forces are
                            adequate in terms of U.S. interests, or whether the U.S. should press
                            Japan to develop substantially larger forces including more forces for
                            regional defense activity in Northeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Japan has currently about 231,000 men under arms with the largest
                            non-communist navy and air force in Asia. Although Japan spends only
                            about 1% of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> on defense, these
                            forces are considered adequate to defend Japan in all conventional
                            contingencies except an all-out Soviet attack. A Japanese decision to
                            make substantial defense increases, going beyond presently planned
                            qualitative improvements, is highly unlikely. But, if such a decision
                            were made, Japan might choose to acquire an independent nuclear
                            capability.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated, Mr.
                            President, today we will limit our discussion of U.S.-Japan relations to
                            the Okinawa issue alone.</p>
                        <p>The President stated, precisely. The Okinawa issue is a situation in
                            which the linkage problem is quite clear. The fundamental question we
                            are faced with is the reversion of Okinawa. The simple options are: we
                            must consider the political cost of keeping control of Okinawa and our
                            military access to it versus the security costs of losing some of this
                            control or perhaps even all of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated, in the
                            Review Group consideration of this issue, the consensus was that we
                            should give something.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">A talking paper

                                decide in 1969 on the reversion of Okinawa in 1972, “provided

                            rested with how far we should go and when we should take these
                            initiatives. Essentially, there are three problems 1) timing of
                            reversion—here we have two choices, agree to proceed this year to a
                            reversion in 1972, or to agree in principle but not to set a specific
                            date for reversion. The advantages of the first course of action is that
                            we would reduce growing pressures in Japan. The disadvantage of this
                            course of action would be that we would be committed at this early date.
                            The advantages to course of action 2 would be that we retain flexibility
                            and would give an impression to the Japanese that we are still uncertain
                            and that we must negotiate a settlement. Within the Review Group the
                            majority favored proceeding now with the view towards a reversion in
                            1972.</p>
                        <p>The President asked, what the specific provisions of the reversion would
                            be, commenting that this would be the focal point of the argument.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated that the
                            essential elements include the retention of U.S. rights to utilize
                            Okinawa as a base and under that broad category we had the issue of
                            nuclear storage, first, and secondly the retention of the right to
                            utilize Okinawa in a conventional base sense. Concerning nuclear
                            operations, there are several possibilities:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) Status quo on storage and freedom to move weapons in and out in
                                an operational sense.</p>
                            <p>2) Interim nuclear storage, with a time limit as to when this option
                                or this authority will run out.</p>
                            <p>3) Emergency rights for nuclear storage, only under emergency
                                conditions but no permanent storage.</p>
                            <p>4) Transit rights only.</p>
                            <p>5) Emergency humanitarian rights.</p>
                            <p>6) No storage of nuclear weapons and no rights under emergency
                                situations.</p></quote>
                        <p>On all of these six provisions we could not arrive at a consensus. Most
                            people thought that options one and two were not acceptable or that we
                            would be unable to obtain them. Under the conventional use options, we
                            isolated four choices:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) The maintainance of status quo, that is continued open
                                conventional rights.</p>
                            <p>2) To negotiate interim conventional rights.</p>
                            <p>3) Limited free use for certain key areas, Vietnam for example and
                                other areas.</p>
                            <p>4) Only conventional rights as a result of agreed-upon
                                consultations.</p></quote>
                        <p>The President said what possibilities do we have to secure a secret deal
                            with the Japanese? One that we could make dependent upon consultations
                            but which would have a low profile in a context with Japanese domestic
                            and Okinawan domestic views.</p>

                            President then asked if we are to be forthcoming on this issue we should
                            be looking at the Trust Territory. Can we create substitute facilities
                            there?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> answered, we have
                            looked at this—land acquisition, the money, and the time involved are
                            very critical. It would take us from three to four years and a
                            considerable expense to develop replacement facilities. Adding that [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] facilities and
                            airfields would take some time to construct but this is our only
                            alternative if we lose Okinawa. The cost of our facilities at Okinawa
                            are in the neighborhood of $1 billion. To replace those in the Trust
                            Territory, it would run<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">Omission in the

                                >Haig</persName>’s notes, <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1"
                                    >Wheeler</persName>’s figure for the trust territories was $3.5
                                to 4 billion.</note></p>
                        <p>General [<persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName>] continued, also
                            the land areas in the Trust Territory are very limited. We are now
                            looking at the Trust problem—specific islands that could be developed
                            and additional facilities which we could construct alternate facilities
                            on.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> to comment on what was actually realistic in
                            terms of our negotiations on this issue. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> stated we seemed to be in complete agreement
                            that it would be necessary to negotiate some kind of agreement with the
                            Japanese. The opposition parties in Japan are working desperately to get
                            a confrontation with the power structure on the issue of U.S.
                            involvement in Japan and their specific rights on Okinawa. Within
                            Okinawa proper, the current population is about one million and it would
                            be necessary for the Japanese to maintain order and control after
                            reversion. If we were to agree to reversion, this could be used to force
                            the Japanese to take on greater responsibilities for their defense.</p>
                        <p>This is a distinct advantage. Then we could reduce our own level of
                            expenditures. On a longer range basis we must consider our bases in
                            Japan proper. Some flexibility and some willingness with respect to
                            Okinawa would give us longer staying power in Japan proper. Concerning
                            the most difficult issue, that of nuclear storage, in 1957 we told
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that we had to have
                            storage and took a hardline in this regard. We tried to get the Japanese
                            to look at the problem at that time. Now <pb n="36" facs="0067"
                                xml:id="pg_36"/>the whole issue has backfired. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> can no longer agree to unlimited
                            nuclear storage. The opposition, domestically, will just not tolerate it
                            and it could result in his downfall. The nuclear proliferation treaty is
                            an issue which also influences this. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>] Another consideration is the fact that we want
                            the Japanese to develop greater political responsibility and to the
                            degree that we do not have free use of Okinawa this tends to drag them
                            into greater responsibility of their own. It seems obvious, however,
                            that we must not be placed into a position which would give the Japanese
                            in effect a veto power over our ability to support our forces in Korea.
                            I think it would be possible to get a strong public statement both from
                            Taiwan and Korea which will protect us in these two specific areas. If
                            we can just resolve the nuclear issue we can probably get a viable
                            treaty with the Japanese. But we must have a public position. It need
                            not be developed today nor need this issue be resolved today. The
                            Japanese Foreign Minister comes in June. Secretary <persName

                            Basically we must have a resolve position in July. We need something for
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to help him at home
                            domestically. I think we can get something from the Japanese on
                            emergency nuclear storage. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] We think of when we might use nuclear weapons in
                            the Far East and list these conditions, I think the Japanese will go
                            along. Actually, the ʽ72 target date came from <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. We know we must have some mutual
                            agreement before that time so that by then a final agreement will be
                            easier. In my own view it will take several years to negotiate a viable
                            arrangement with the Japanese with respect to Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>
                            to comment on the domestic situation in Japan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> replied, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is strong but he could fall. He
                            needs some help as a result of his visit here.</p>
                        <p>The President said, well wouldn’t U.S. support tend to hurt him
                            domestically?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> stated, no, the
                            Japanese measure the ability of their leaders to get along with the U.S.
                            and respect.</p>
                        <p>The President said, yes, especially their ability to negotiate favorable
                            trade arrangements. This they do like.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> continued, the opposition
                            really wants to launch a major campaign to put the Okinawan issue in the
                            forefront. This has a demagogic appearance. They hope to merge the
                            Okinawan issue with the overall treaty issues. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> on the other hand wants to
                            decouple Okinawa and to get it out of the way before the overall treaty
                            review must be faced.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that the key point is for us to understand what the
                            problem really is. We may not have but two options. We <pb n="37"
                                facs="0068" xml:id="pg_37"/>don’t want to hurt our friends by the
                            position we take. The idea that we are imposing on poor little Japan,
                            however, should not be the overriding factor in our deliberations. There
                            is a degree of schizophrenia in the Japanese position. They like to be
                            told what to do but then resent it when we tell them. There is a fine
                            line between U.S. guidance and U.S. pressure. They benefit if they can
                            appear to be on their own. We are in a solid position but they don’t
                            like our bases, our planes, etc. The opposition exploits this. We in
                            turn provide a nuclear umbrella.</p>

                        <p>In the twenty years since Japan’s economic miracle began, an
                            over-populated, war-devastated, resources-poor country has become the
                            third largest economic power in the world, and the world leader in many
                            industries. Japan’s growth rate continues to be the highest of any
                            developed country; its exports continue to expand at the highest rate in
                            the industrialized world; and it has recently recorded large balance of
                            payments surpluses. The U.S. and Japanese economies are closely linked
                            by large and rapidly growing trade and a common reliance on the strength
                            of the dollar.</p>
                        <p>The growth of Japan as a major economic power base in East Asia, its
                            integration into the free world’s economy, and its close relations with
                            the United States have been greatly assisted by the United States. We
                            have encouraged and assisted these developments to a substantial degree
                            by shouldering the costs of defending Japan, by extending preferred
                            access to the U.S. capital market and by continued efforts to draw Japan
                            into international organizations.</p>
                        <p>The process has also been of great benefit to the U.S. Japan, second only
                            to Canada, is the most important market for United States exports. Our
                            agricultural exports alone are about $1 billion annually. Japanese and

                            economic growth has also formed the foundation of the growing sense of
                            U.S.-Japan partnership.</p>
                        <p>But the current pattern and size of our economic relations are producing
                            serious problems which are primarily focused in the balance of payments,
                            particularly trade and military expenditures. The U.S. bilateral trade
                            deficit with Japan in 1968 was $1.1 billion and the U.S. bilateral
                            payments deficit was about $1 billion. A major component of the latter
                            was U.S. military expenditures in Japan of about $570 million. To a
                            large extent, the deficits are directly related to the impact of the
                            Vietnam war and the continuing high rates of economic growth in the
                            United States. The trade deficit is also the result of a strong Japanese
                            export performance based on competitive advantage and keyed to the U.S.
                            market, combined with Japanese protectionism. Our balance of payments
                            position has benefited from cooperative Japanese action, but we have not
                            achieved a full financial offset by Japan of our military
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p><pb n="39" facs="0070" xml:id="pg_39"/>U.S. concern with balance of
                            payments and net trade position has arisen only in the past few years,
                            when it became apparent that restoration of equilibrium in our overall
                            balance of payments was essential. If the U.S. is to balance its
                            payments, only countries in surplus positions can afford to absorb the
                            impact of U.S. adjustment. It has accordingly become increasingly clear
                            in recent years that surplus countries must play an important role in
                            any solution of the adjustment problem. The more directly the impact of
                            U.S. adjustment falls on the major surplus countries, such as Japan at
                            present, the less likely it is that American adjustment will force
                            countries not now in surplus to adopt deflationary and restrictive
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s economic strength, its large trade surplus with both the United
                            States and the world at large, its recent status as one of the world’s
                            strongest surplus nations, and the important trade and economic
                            implications of its future growth—all warrant the assumption by Japan of
                            greater economic responsibility and acceleration of constructive
                            policies in fields of concern to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Trade frictions between the U.S. and Japan have arisen in recent years
                            because of (a) sharply increasing Japanese penetration of the U.S.
                            market for manufactured goods, which has in turn fostered protectionist
                            sentiment in the U.S., and (b) Japan’s protectionist attitude on certain
                            problems and unwillingness to accord U.S. producers ready access to the
                            Japanese market (which contrast with Japan’s general stance on
                            international trade issues). Both issues have aroused the concern of
                            U.S. businessmen and some Members of Congress.</p>
                        <p>Japan uses a variety of policies and procedures to protect its domestic
                            markets. Quota restrictions, maintained contrary to <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> rules, are more extensive than those
                            of any other major industrialized country. The extensive Japanese system
                            of import control procedures equally poses serious obstacles to American
                            exports. At the same time Japan has been forced to enter into agreements
                            with developed countries other than the U.S. to limit its exports of at
                            least one major product, textiles. And informal restrictions resulting
                            from Government-industry ties, reflecting deep-seated elements of
                            Japanese culture, add to the difficulty of foreign penetration of the
                            Japanese market.</p>
                        <p>The problem of Japanese penetration of American markets is not amenable
                            to easy solution. The penetration is fundamentally based on a strong
                            Japanese competitive position in world markets at present exchange
                            rates, aggravated by inflationary pressures in the United States in
                            recent years. Voluntary restraints by Japan on some of its exports to
                            Europeans may divert some sales to the U.S., but at the same time Japan
                            maintains such restraints on 73 exports to us as well. (This includes
                            about 38 cotton textile products under the LTA and about 15 steel
                            items.)</p>
                        <p><pb n="40" facs="0071" xml:id="pg_40"/>The immediate gain for U.S.
                            exporters of a relaxation of Japanese import quotas would probably not
                            be dramatic because of the relatively small amount of U.S. trade which
                            is directly affected (probably less than $100 million of our total
                            exports). Removal of other Japanese barriers to imports and some of
                            their informal barriers would result in an additional (but difficult to
                            quantify) increase in trade. However, removal of Japanese quota
                            restrictions would reduce a major irritant in U.S.-Japan relations.</p>
                        <p>Japanese restrictions on foreign direct investment also hinder the
                            ability of U.S. firms to surmount Japanese trade barriers and have
                            engendered strong U.S. business and political resentment. Although
                            currently of secondary importance because of the U.S. balance of
                            payments program to restrain foreign direct investment, Japanese
                            liberalization of such investment offers increasingly attractive
                            potential for U.S. investors to improve their position in Japan and
                            other Asian markets and is fervently sought by some important U.S.
                            industries.</p>
                        <p>For its part, Japan greatly fears growing pressures in the United States
                            to restrict imports. The Japanese view with extreme concern actions by
                            other countries which might restrict Japan’s trade. For example, Japan
                            reacted frenetically to the possibility of a U.S. border tax in 1968 and
                            subsequently supported a KR tariff cut acceleration as a trade expanding
                            alternative. Japan is also concerned about current U.S. restrictions
                            such as the <gloss target="#t_ASP_1">ASP</gloss> customs valuation
                            procedure (which the U.S. has decided to seek legislation to remove).
                            The Japanese also resent being forced into “voluntary” restraints on
                            exports which they have adopted to defuse protectionist sentiment in the
                            U.S. but regard as a form of U.S. non-tariff barrier.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Issues for Decision</p>
                        <p>There are four major economic issues between the U.S. and Japan at this
                            time: (1) Japan’s import restrictions, (2) Japan’s barriers to foreign
                            direct investment, (3) textiles, and (4) Japan’s help for the U.S.
                            balance of payments. The U.S. may at some point have to decide on its
                            priorities among these four areas, considering both desirability from
                            our standpoint and possibility of achieving Japan’s cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Since the forthcoming trade mission to the Far East will deal only with
                            the first three of these issues, this paper will focus on them although
                            referring at several points to the implications for our balance of
                            payments arrangements with Japan. Our textile decisions must of course
                            relate to Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong as well as Japan.</p>

                        <p>Present U.S. policy is to press vigorously for significant reductions in
                            the quota restrictions presently employed by Japan, since both coun<pb

                            are best served by trade expansion rather than contraction. However, we
                            have indicated in bilateral negotiations that the lack of a satisfactory
                            response at an early date will make it necessary for the U.S. to seek

                            actions against Japan. The United States has also made continuing

                        <p>Any U.S. approach toward achieving these objectives will be handicapped
                            by a simultaneous effort to obtain new voluntary export restraints from
                            Japan, e.g., on woolen and synthetic textiles, or by any other U.S.
                            protectionist action affecting Japan. On the other hand, new U.S.
                            initiatives to liberalize trade will reinforce our efforts with Japan
                            and minimize to some degree the costs listed under each alternative.
                            Specific liberalizing steps of particular interest to Japan, such as

                            equalization tax and is to receive priority treatment under the

                        <p>1. Given the political and economic importance to Japan of their
                            preferred treatment, would add significant leverage to the U.S.

                        <p>1. Would appear as a decision by the Nixon Administration to repudiate
                            the past U.S. recognition of Japan’s special economic relationship with
                            the U.S. and hence could raise a major political row with Japan.</p>
                        <p>2. If the threat had to be implemented, could lead to Japanese
                            retaliation in the overall balance of payments field, such as
                            unwillingness to neutralize U.S. military expenditures in Japan and
                            conversion of dollar reserves into gold.</p>
                        <p>3. Given Japan’s shift into a sizable and reasonably stable balance of
                            payments surplus, and its reduced reliance on U.S. capital, the
                            preferred treatment may no longer be needed anyway—this approach, if
                            successful, would implicitly tie our hands in eliminating the
                            preferences in the near future. (This con becomes unimportant if we are
                            successful in eliminating the controls and the IET altogether since the

                        <p>The issue is how to deal with the growth in imports of woolen and
                            synthetic textiles into the U.S. within the framework of our overall
                            policy of freer trade, in accordance with previous Administration
                            statements on textiles, and taking into account overall U.S. foreign
                            policy interests in Japan and the Asian LDCs. The three Asian countries
                            publicly and privately and Hong Kong privately have expressed opposition
                            to any voluntary arrangement and have discussed joint opposition to our
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Japan, any agreement on textiles will be accompanied by a
                            corresponding reduction in Japan’s responsiveness on the other two
                            economic issues already discussed and perhaps by adverse political
                            reactions. In the case of the three LDCs, any textile approach will run
                            counter to our professed policy of supporting economic development
                            through trade as well as aid; this contradiction will be particularly
                            embarrassing in Korea and Taiwan, where our aid efforts have stressed
                            expansion of their exports. In addition, the three LDCs—especially Korea
                            and Taiwan—are greatly concerned about the impact on their economies at
                            the end of the war in Vietnam. U.S. expenditures for the war have
                            provided them with an added economic stimulus, although its importance
                            has been declining, and they are actively seeking opportunities to
                            further increase their exports to compensate for the expected decreases
                            in U.S. expenditures. Since textiles are a key component of any such
                            increases, a request for restraints at this time will be particularly
                            troublesome to our overall relations with them. In the specific case of
                            Korea, we will face demands for compensatory aid since woolens and
                            synthetic textiles account for 75 percent of their total textiles
                            exports to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The magnitude of the costs (and benefits) differs among the alternative
                            specific approaches outlined below. In addition, the costs will be
                            affected by the context in which our proposal is made. They can be
                            reduced, especially vis-à-vis Japan, by a firm Administration commitment
                            to seek elimination of <gloss target="#t_ASP_1">ASP</gloss> and possibly
                            other customs valuation procedures, to take other trade liberalizing

                            />protectionist legislation. In addition, the Asians would, of course,
                            be more willing to accept restrictions if they were convinced that
                            unilateral quota legislation was a real possibility in the absence of
                            voluntary restraint agreements.</p>

                            clear in the forthcoming Asian trip that we consider our textile problem

                            rollbacks from present levels and some sharing of market growth in the
                            future).</p>

                        <p>(1) Could avoid uncontrolled legislation, which could be so restrictive
                            that it would generate severe retaliation, seriously damaging overall
                            U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>(2) Would provide straightforward approach to the problem permitting U.S.
                            to provide compensation through compensating tariff reductions (when
                            authority to do so is obtained) or foreign countries to retaliate
                            legally.</p>
                        <p>(3) Would relieve us of ongoing burden of negotiating and administering

                        <p>On May 7, 1969, from 11:16 a.m. to noon, the National Security Council
                            met to discuss Far East trade issues in anticipation of Secretary of
                            Commerce <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>’ trip to East
                            Asia. Textiles was one of the major topics discussed in addition to
                            exports, balance of payments, non-tariff barriers, and common market
                            agricultural policies. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander
                                Haig</persName>’s handwritten notes, the only account of the meeting
                            found, indicate that the President, in reference to the Japanese textile
                            negotiations, said, “play it a little more forcefully. Let them know we
                            may go legislative route. Okinawa etc. is linked. We may go easy on
                            latter for prog[ress] on trade.” (National Archives, Nixon Presidential

                                >Stans</persName> wrote a memorandum for the President, dated the

                            of textiles, <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> wrote,
                            “Although I did not receive the support of the four countries I visited
                            for an international solution, I believe the Asians now more clearly
                            understand our determination to find an answer to our textile problem.
                            Every country has agreed to continue the dialogue with us.” (Memorandum

                            result of the trip was the unanimous rebuff to our textile request from
                            the Asians. All flatly refused even to attend a <gloss

                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> also noted that the Japanese
                            “made it clear that they related our textile request to our requests
                            that they liberalize their treatment of imports from the U.S. and U.S.
                            investment in Japan. We thus made no progress on these other issues

                            saying that the President’s May 14 speech was highly regarded in

                            that the Japanese press, most unusually, unanimously praised the
                            President’s speech. Even the highly critical <hi rend="italic"
                                >Asahi</hi> praised the speech, a very rare occurrence for an

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> said that it might be
                            easier for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to
                            understand the Okinawa problem if one compared German and Japanese
                            security attitudes. The Germans have a national consensus on their
                            security policy. On the other hand, Japan has no national consensus. In
                            contrast to the Germans, the Japanese have no sense of a threat of
                            invasion or <pb n="51" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_51"/>any sense of
                            insecurity from external threats. The Japanese consider themselves an
                            island country, which no one would seek to invade or attack. Therefore,
                            Japan could not get itself involved in a war, unless it itself undertook
                            to start such a conflict.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> said that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> Government has tried to explain to
                            the public the need for a sense of responsibility for the rest of Asia.
                            However, the press ignores the Sato statements and only criticizes his
                            policy. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, therefore, is in
                            danger of losing his majority in the Diet, having already lost the
                            majority of the votes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> said that the Japanese
                            people find frustrating continued foreign rule of Okinawa. They wish to
                            have Okinawa back as soon as possible. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asked why the Japanese did not have the same
                            attitude towards the Southern Kuriles, which the Russians hold and the
                            Japanese claim. <persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> answered
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has pushed Japanese
                            claims hard in the Diet but the press ignores him. Furthermore, there is
                            no Japanese population in the Kuriles, such as is the case in
                            Okinawa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> then went on to discuss
                            the Security Treaty and emphasized that this treaty needs to be
                            understood in Japan as in our mutual interest, not as a favor to the
                            United States. The United States wants the closest possible relations
                            with Japan and takes seriously the Okinawa issue. We intend to discuss
                            the Okinawan problem in a serious and constructive spirit, leaving to
                            negotiation the precise formulae. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST_1"
                                >Shimoda</persName> that the President was looking at the problem
                            openly. He pointed to the particular importance of Okinawa with respect
                            to Korea. The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–121 incident had
                            pointed up the physical requirements for Okinawa with respect to Korean
                            operations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> said there is no question
                            about letting the United States use its bases in Okinawa. The Japanese
                            wanted the Security Treaty arrangements to apply but understood that the
                            United States has wider responsibilities. The Japanese Government wishes
                            to find therefore a modus vivendi to meet our requirements. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said we would put our needs

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked what would happen
                            if the Security Treaty were abrogated. <persName corresp="#p_ST_1"
                                >Shimoda</persName> answered that in this instance, Japan would turn
                            to China under the leadership of the left. On the other hand, this need
                            not happen. <persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> urged that
                            the Okinawan issue be settled by the end of this year. He felt that,
                            after this issue was settled, Japan would face up to its Asian
                            responsibilities since the people would see the problem more clearly.

                        <p>1. We shall basically pursue our current relationship with Japan as our
                            major partner in Asia, seeking ways to improve this relationship from
                            the viewpoint of U.S. national interests and to seek an increasingly
                            larger Japanese role in Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. We shall allow the present Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security
                            to continue without amendment after 1970 when it becomes subject to
                            renunciation or amendment.</p>

                            gradual alterations in our base structure and base utilization in Japan
                            to reduce major irritants while retaining essential base functions.</p>
                        <p>4. We shall continue our present policy of encouraging moderate increases
                            and qualitative improvement in Japan’s defense efforts, while avoiding
                            any pressure on her to develop substantially larger forces or to play a

                            and provided detailed negotiations are completed at that time.</p>
                        <p>2. Our desire for maximum free conventional use of the military bases,

                                the reversion of Okinawa. He also perceived a problem “with the
                                final paragraph in which the President is quoted as using security
                                interests on Okinawa to develop leverage on trade issues. As a
                                matter of principle, this should never be carved in stone for
                                historians to examine. More importantly, since he is talking about
                                textiles and since he may at some future date have some problems
                                with his decision in this area because of political affiliation, I
                                would strongly recommend that the last paragraph not be included in
                                the decision memorandum. In any event, I think it is very important
                                that the President not refer in any form to the linkage between
                                Okinawa and trade.” The paragraph was subsequently deleted.

                        <p>These opening skirmishes have served to draw the battle lines more
                            clearly—in the following broad terms:</p>
                        <p>1. The Japanese now know that they are faced with some very tough
                            negotiating demands on our part; they are worried and are already
                            beginning to soften some aspects of their position to meet our
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>2. The principal give in the Japanese position is on freedom for conduct
                            of conventional military combat operations with respect to the Korean
                            area. The depth of our concern about Korea, particularly, is fully
                            appreciated and the Japanese are prepared to go fairly far to meet our
                            requirements—even to the extent of considering a strong public
                            commitment. The Japanese are also pretty well down the road to granting
                            similar rights with respect to Taiwan and perhaps the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>3. The Japanese will wish to negotiate any special arrangements for Korea
                            and Taiwan within the framework of the current Treaty arrangements; this
                            is possible and also helpful to the Japanese since they can then say
                            that reversion of Okinawa is on the “homeland level”.</p>
                        <p>4. We have detected absolutely no give on the Japanese side with respect
                            to retaining nuclear weapons on Okinawa; however, they realize this is a
                            very difficult pill for us to swallow and are right now very well
                            disposed to making compensatory concessions in other areas of the
                            Okinawan negotiations.</p>
                        <p>5. It virtually goes without saying that the pressure for a reversion
                            agreement this year is intense in both Japan and Okinawa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Impact of Okinawa on Other Issues</p>
                        <p>While nobody is directly linking Okinawan reversion to the other major
                            problems between ourselves and Japan, the Japanese are making this
                            calculation time and time again.</p>
                        <p>There are clear signs of Japanese recognition of the need for significant
                            concessions, likewise, in the economic area—to avoid “complicat<pb
                                n="56" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_56"/>ing” the Okinawan reversion
                            issue. The major problem for the Japanese is that they are now uncertain
                            as to what economic issues have the highest priority for us. They have
                            been presented with requests for immediate action on such a broad array
                            of trade and investment issues that they are not sure which direction to
                            turn. As a consequence, they are developing their own sense of
                            priorities based upon the internal difficulties involved; Embassy Tokyo
                            reports that the Japanese are more likely, therefore, to move ahead with
                            capital liberalization rather than textiles, and a joint venture
                            involving Chrysler has recently been announced. The problem of our
                            priorities in the economic field will have to be dealt with before the
                            Joint Cabinet Committee meeting at the end of July, if we are to reap
                            the maximum dividends from the current situation.</p>

                        <p>The President said that the problems we were discussing this year, such
                            as Okinawa and trade and investment liberalization were difficult, <pb
                                n="57" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_57"/>but he believed that we must try
                            to find mutually acceptable solutions, and could do so, because such
                            solutions were in the interest of both countries. Frankly, each side
                            should bargain hard for such a solution. However, no other President in
                            history had visited Japan as often, and he recognized the great
                            importance of United States-Japan friendship to the entire Pacific
                            region, not just the two countries. Because of his personal relations
                            with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> and others, he was
                            determined that we find an answer to these problems, recognizing that we
                            each would bargain hard. He asked that his view that we could find a
                            mutually satisfactory solution be conveyed to the Prime Minister, whose
                            interest, he knew, was deep.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> thanked the President for
                            agreeing to meet him before departing Washington tomorrow. He noted that
                            the present cabinet in Japan, based its policies on the relations of
                            mutual trust between Japan and the United States, in diplomatic
                            relations of course, but also in domestic politics and economics, which
                            it wished to stabilize further. Although some elements opposed the
                            Security Treaty the majority of the Japanese people were confident that
                            the Security Treaty was in Japan’s own interest and recognized that
                            Japan had enjoyed almost 25 years of peaceful development because of
                            this security arrangement. Japan strongly wished to resolve the Okinawa
                            problem by 1972 within the context of the Security Treaty. He looked

                                >Rogers</persName>, and said that Japan indeed would bargain hard,
                            but the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> would give its all to
                            arrive at a satisfactory solution. Because he was convinced that mutual
                            trust between both countries was most important <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> said that he has always talked
                            very frankly since becoming Foreign Minister (he always talked frankly
                            with former Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>)
                            and intended to continue to do so particularly because there were
                            difficult problems to solve. With respect to import and investment
                            liberalization, noted earlier by the President, he asked the President
                            to understand and bear in mind that Japan lagged behind the United
                            States, but was doing its best to go faster.</p>
                        <p>The President wished <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> to know
                            that he had every confidence in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1"
                                >Meyer</persName>, an old friend whom he had seen in Tehran. He
                            wanted to have in Japan a professional, skilled in diplomacy, who shared
                            his views on the importance of the Pacific area and Japan’s role
                                there.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2"><persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Armin

                                facs="0089" xml:id="pg_58"/>be in the Pacific, not just because of
                            Viet-Nam, which was peripheral, but in the broader aspects, which could
                            be approached only in terms of United States-Japan cooperation, under
                            which we recognized that problems such as Okinawa must be considered in
                            terms of security. It was not what we wanted; we desired no bases, per
                            se, and recognized the political problem this posed for Japan. However,
                            Okinawa was important only as it related to overall security and the
                            role the United States and Japan must play together if the Pacific Ocean
                            were to be a peaceful sea. He recalled saying in Japan in 1957 just when
                            Japan had started to come back that without a strong Japan in a
                            leadership position there could be no permanent peace and stability in
                            the Pacific. This was infinitely more true now. Starting with this
                            belief, and the belief that we could solve this problem in the larger
                            context, we must consider these broader aspects.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> agreed absolutely that Japan
                            should cooperate with the United States, in the context of the
                            relationship of mutual trust, to contribute to peace and stability in
                            Asia. On June 8, the Foreign Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_ASPAC_1"
                                >ASPAC</gloss> nations would meet at Kawana, Japan, to further
                            promote the objective of regional cooperation. However, as the President
                            knew, Japan’s Constitution was unique with respect to defense; it
                            severely restricted any overseas military cooperation by Japan. He also
                            hoped the President would consider Japan’s unique views on nuclear
                            weapons, which derived from the fact that Japan was the only country to
                            have suffered from their use.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> wished to put to rest any question on
                            defense matters by the flexible application of the Security Treaty, at
                            such time as Okinawa reversion took place, on the basis of a solution in
                            the context of the Security Treaty, which would strengthen the political
                            and psychological aspects of Japanese American relations. He would carry
                            on his discussions with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> on that basis.</p>
                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName>
                            seemed to understand all the political and geopolitical problems
                            thoroughly. Therefore, Okinawa would not be approached just as a
                            military-defense problem, but as a joint political-military problem. As
                            we all knew, the United States at present had responsibilities in Korea,
                            Taiwan, the Philippines, and, for the general area throughout <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss>. It would not be in Japan’s
                            interest for the United States to withdraw from those responsibilities.
                            For example, Japan had a great role in Southeast Asia and would be
                            affected more than the United States by what happened in Malaysia,
                            Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, let alone Viet-Nam.
                            The decisions we took were not solely selfish, but involved the entire
                            area. In viewing the future in practical terms, he hoped, and said he
                            would work for, a greater role for Japan economically (where we welcomed
                            Japan’s expanding role), politically through <gloss target="#t_ASPAC_1"
                                >ASPAC</gloss>, and, in the conventional <pb n="59" facs="0090"
                                xml:id="pg_59"/>sense at this time, militarily. It was not healthy
                            for the United States or the Free World to have only the United States
                            in the Pacific area as the sole guarantor of freedom of choice and
                            independence, which was what the Pacific nations wanted. We needed, and
                            welcomed the development of a new policy, whereby Japan, the only major
                            industrial power in the area could play a larger role, not just
                            economically, but a diplomatic role based on conventional military
                            strength. He said this now, not that it was a matter for immediate
                            discussion, but because he wanted <persName corresp="#p_AK_1"
                                >Aichi</persName> to know his thinking. He recalled his speech
                            before the Japan-American Society in 1953, in which he said, in
                            retrospect, that Japan’s adoption of strict constitutional provisions on
                            war (probably at our insistence) was an error. It made headlines
                                then.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4"><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                                    >RN</gloss></hi>, pp. 129–130.</note> Now that many years have
                            passed and in viewing the kind of world the American and Japanese people
                            were trying to shape it was not healthy to have only one super power in
                            the Pacific as sole guarantor against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and Communist China. Therefore, we welcomed an
                            expanded role for Japan, consistent with Japanese public opinion and how
                            well the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> brought the people along.
                            Therefore, he hoped a better climate would emerge as a result of a
                            solution to Okinawa, even though he knew this would be difficult.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> said that the effective
                            presence of the United States was essential in the broadest terms to the
                            security of the area as a whole, and Japan felt that it was essential to
                            create an environment which would make possible effective cooperation to
                            that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The President said he looked forward to seeing <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> again in November when he would
                            come to Washington with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> hoped that the President and
                            the Prime Minister would resolve the Okinawa problem at that time.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we should both understand that we were discussing
                            Okinawa and trade and investment problems in a preliminary way. He asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> to inform <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that it would be in our interest
                            to try to resolve these when he came to Washington, but summit meetings
                            were meaningless without preliminary hard work. Therefore, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> would be having discussions with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Meyer</persName> and in Washington we
                            would discuss these matters with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST_1"
                                >Shimoda</persName>, to clear away the underbrush. Then when he met
                            the Prime Minister we would have a program ready to go.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the Americans and Japanese were similar in that
                            they bargained hard. Only through hard bargaining could a meaningful
                            contract be reached. If one side didn’t bargain hard, any <pb n="60"
                                facs="0091" xml:id="pg_60"/>contract reached would contain the seeds
                            for breaching it. Therefore we welcomed hard bargaining to reach a
                            solution we could sell the American people and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> could sell the Japanese people.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that the press be told that he discussed with the
                            Foreign Minister a number of major bilateral issues which affected the
                            United States and Japan, such as Okinawa, investment and trade
                            liberalization, and beyond, to the general problems of the Pacific area.
                            In this very constructive discussion both the President and the Foreign
                            Minister presented points of issue. The President felt that these
                            discussions and the forthcoming discussions by the Foreign Minister and
                            the Secretary of State would prepare the way for the constructive
                            outcome of, and were an essential preliminary for discussions with the
                            Prime Minister, scheduled for November.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName> agreed on this sort of general
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it was important to make it known that this
                            meeting was more than an exchange of social pleasantries, and included
                            important substantive problems as well, to help set the stage for
                            progress for a final solution to this problem in November.</p>

                        <p>3. You also wish to reserve the nuclear issue to help other issues such

                                of foreign investment in the automobile industry and have promised
                                to announce in 1970 substantial liberalization in other fields.</p>
                            <p>—On the textile issue, I proposed the negotiation of a comprehensive
                                bilateral agreement on wool and man-made fiber textiles and apparel.
                                The Japanese agreed, without commitment, to send a delegation to
                                Washington by September 15 to discuss this proposal with us. This
                                could result in a subsequent negotiation of a bilateral
                                agreement.</p></quote>
                        <p>Despite their willingness to discuss the problem further in Washington,
                            it is premature to be optimistic that the Japanese will negotiate an
                            acceptable agreement with us.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">On August 25,
                                the Consulate General in Osaka-Kobe produced a report that described
                                problems of the Japanese textile industry. First, it was losing its
                                competitiveness relative to other Asian textile producers. Second,
                                it had lost its place as Japan’s most dynamic export industry, and
                                realized that its influence over Japanese trade policy would become
                                increasingly marginal as its importance diminished relative to other
                                exporters. Third, it abhorred U.S. demands for voluntary restraints
                                on Japanese synthetic textile exports to the United States, and
                                feared that the Japanese government would weaken its opposition to
                                such demands in exchange for American concessions on other economic
                                and political issues. (Airgram 42 from the Consulate General in

                            Department we plan to follow up the Tokyo discussions with further
                            representations to Japan as well as to other key textile exporting
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>While we are carrying out these steps, however, time is running out on an
                            essential element in our textile effort. This is the notification to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> that we are <hi rend="italic"
                                >reserving our right</hi> to increase tariffs on textile products.
                            We have the right—the so-called “open season”—to give such notification
                            during a limited period of time only once every three years. We are now
                            in that period.</p>
                        <p>Giving notice reserving our right under this provision would not commit
                            us to raise textile tariffs. We could reach a decision on that question
                            at any time during the next three years. It would, however, assure us of
                            the authority under <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> to make such
                            a change in our textile tariffs and would serve our immediate
                            purposes.</p>
                        <quote><p>—First, it would apply a certain amount of pressure on the
                                exporting countries to negotiate textile agreements with us.</p>
                            <p><pb n="63" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_63"/>—Second, it would preserve the
                                right to change our tariffs as an alternative to agreements if we
                                are not able to negotiate agreements with the countries
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>—Third, our domestic position will be weakened if we allow the “open
                                season” to slip by without having at least reserved our right to
                                take action under it in the future. The “open season” question has
                                been raised publicly and our failure to reserve our right to use it
                                may be construed as a sign of weakness.</p></quote>
                        <p>In essence, giving notice while not committing us to taking action is
                            simply a prudent step to preserve this option for the future. There have
                            been differing views on this matter within the government and unless an
                            agreement is reached soon I shall work with the other agencies to
                            develop a position paper for you to consider.</p>

                            <pb n="64" facs="0095" xml:id="pg_64"/>to make such a reservation during
                            the “open season” which lasts through the rest of 1969. We would not
                            actually raise tariffs unless our efforts to achieve negotiated
                            voluntary agreements failed and we then decided that tariff increases
                            were the best way to deal with the textile problem.</p>
                        <p>The objective of this step would be to pressure Japan to negotiate a
                            satisfactory voluntary agreement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"
                                >Stans</persName> has concluded that the Japanese will not be any
                            more forthcoming despite our shift from seeking a multilateral agreement
                            to seeking comprehensive bilateral agreements with the four key
                            exporters.</p>
                        <p>However, the Japanese did not know of our shift in position before the
                            recent <gloss target="#t_ECONCOM_1">ECONCOM</gloss>. They agreed to send
                            a delegation to Washington by September 15 to discuss the issue and we
                            will not really know how forthcoming they might be until those talks
                            take place. I think we should await the results of those discussions
                            before taking any new steps to pressure the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Reserving our right to increase our tariffs has serious implications
                            which should be the subject of interagency study. We cannot legally
                            reserve our right for textiles alone but would have to do so for all
                            imports. Other countries, to protect themselves economically and for
                            political reasons, would then reserve the right to raise their tariffs
                            on all their imports—particularly since you have no authority at present
                            to reduce other U.S. tariffs to compensate them for any actual increases
                            in our textile tariffs which might eventuate. The results would be:</p>
                        <p>1. Major domestic problems with other U.S. industries seeking protection
                            against imports. The opportunity to actually raise tariffs, once we had
                            reserved the right to do so, would be irresistibly tempting and you
                            would face tremendous pressure from them to act.</p>
                        <p>2. Major domestic political problems with all those industries who would
                            be hurt by our own compensatory tariff cuts, or by foreign retaliation,
                            if we were to actually raise tariffs on textiles. They would also be
                            hurt to some extent even by the possibility of foreign retaliation,
                            since their customers would seek alternative sources of supply to hedge
                            against the possibility of actual action.</p>
                        <p>3. Additional domestic political problems because such action would
                            increase the difficulty of inducing foreign countries (including Japan)
                            to reduce their non-tariff barriers against U.S. exports, which is a
                            major issue to many important U.S. firms.</p>
                        <p>4. Major foreign policy problems. A trade war would be threatened and
                            there would be an anguished response from virtually every country in the
                            world, because of the encouragement to their own protectionists as well
                            as the real specter of export and hence real economic losses.</p>
                        <p>5. Re-escalation of the textile issue to a multilateral level. Your
                            decision to shift from the comprehensive multilateral approval to the
                                <pb n="65" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_65"/>comprehensive bilateral
                            approach was partly aimed at eliminating the need for further approaches
                            to countries other than the four major exporters in the Far East.
                            Specifically, it removed the problem from U.S.-European relations.
                            Tariff increases would, however, catch imports from all sources. It
                            would be a rather broad-gauged instrument to use solely for leverage
                            against Japan.</p>

                        <p>We are concerned that continued delay in beginning the removal of lethal
                            gas weapons from Okinawa could be damaging in Japan and Okinawa, and
                            perhaps here in the U.S. Adverse impact of the July gas incident on
                            Okinawa was minimized by prompt announcement of our <pb n="66"
                                facs="0097" xml:id="pg_66"/>intention to remove the weapons.<note

                                began leaking during routine maintenance (paint removal) on Okinawa.
                                Twenty-three U.S. military personnel and one U.S. civilian were
                                affected, none of them seriously. Ten days later, on July 18, a
                                front page story in the <hi rend="italic">Wall Street Journal</hi>
                                reported that there had been a chemical weapons leak on Okinawa.
                                This story produced a public uproar in Japan. Deputy Assistant
                                Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_DDJ_1">Dennis J.

                                Gas Incident, July 8, 1969) On July 22 the Department sent a
                                Department of Defense public statement to the Embassy in Tokyo,
                                providing details about the accident. The text was sent in telegram

                            determine when the removal would begin or how long it would take, the

                        <p>We believe that the Japanese will raise this issue with us before too
                            long, and that we should, at least, be in position to say the removal
                            has begun. In addition to the impact in Japan and Okinawa, further delay
                            also runs the risk of criticism in the U.S. There would, of course, be
                            grievous international and domestic repercussions should a second
                            incident occur before removal has even begun.</p>
                        <p>We understand that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> has not yet
                            adopted a plan for removal of these weapons, and that even after a plan
                            is adopted, there may be considerable delay before the removal operation
                            begins. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA_1"

                            situation and the importance of the problem, we believe that you should

                            some items of leverage to force them into a sensible negotiating
                            position. It occurs to me that there may be some opportunity in the
                            following two items:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. Apparently the Japanese have an interest in acquiring a
                                substantial amount of gold from the United States.</p>
                            <p>2. Apart from the question of the return of Okinawa, there is
                                apparently a major issue of the amount which the Japanese shall pay
                                to the U.S. in reimbursement for facilities.</p></quote>
                        <p>I propose that either or both of these items are of sufficient
                            significance that the textile matter could be worked into them. I leave
                            it to you as to whether the suggestions are valid and whether they
                            should be passed on to the President.</p>

                        <p>1. This morning you suggested that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"
                                >Stans</persName>’ rather abrasive public statement about Japan
                            might be helpful, in the particular sense that he was casting himself in
                            the role of the “heavy” in a difficult negotiation.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d21fn2"><persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName> is
                                apparently referring to an interview that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> gave to the Japanese press
                                corps on September 23, when <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"
                                    >Stans</persName> said that the Japanese negotiating posture on
                                textiles was unsatisfactory, and that this deadlock was damaging the
                                U.S.-Japanese relationship. Excerpts from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>’ press conference are
                                available in <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Kei Wakaizumi</persName>’s

                                    of the Secret U.S.-Japan Okinawa Reversion Negotiations</hi>
                                (University of Hawai’i Press, 2002), pp. 168–170.</note> I agreed,
                            and agree, with you on the narrow point. In a larger perspective, I
                            believe that the Stans’ approach, if we accept it as good practice,
                            could be disastrous for us.</p>
                        <p>2. Let us ask ourselves whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"
                                >Stans</persName> would have used similar language, and taken equal
                            liberties in interpreting events, if the other party had been the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>? Or Germany? Or Holland? Or any other
                            country with which we have nominally friendly relationships?</p>
                        <p>3. I think that we may make a grievous and unrecoverable mistake if we
                            suppose that the Japanese are less sensitive than anyone else to public
                            heavy handedness. Among the origins of World War II, if we will only
                            remember, was the Immigration Act of 1923 and its overt discrimination
                            against Japanese emigrants to the United States. The war itself, and the
                            events of its final days, inescapably left psychological as well as
                            physical scars in Japan. The Japanese have a term, “war losers” which is
                            used only in their private conversations; it incorporates a large
                            element of self-pity, but self-pity is of course the reciprocal of
                            resentment. Differential treatment of Japan inescapably must work on
                            this basic residue of attitudes toward the war winners.</p>
                        <p>4. There are other reasons—racial and historical—why we should be wary of
                            believing that Japanese are readier to be treated with contumely than
                            ordinary people. I need not go into these, but they are real enough, as
                            I imagine that EA would agree. In my own experience, I have not noticed
                            that our interests in Japan have been better served <pb n="69"
                                facs="0100" xml:id="pg_69"/>when we have questioned in public
                            Japanese good faith than when we have pursued more customary and
                            civilized methods of discussion and negotiations.</p>
                        <p>5. I am led to write this note because Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> is playing with the idea of
                            encouraging the Hill to give us legislation which would impose quotas at
                            1966 import levels unless the President succeeded in negotiating
                            “voluntary” restraints. When I asked him if he thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJH_1">Harold Wilson</persName> or Tony Crosland would
                            negotiate at this kind of gunpoint, he said no, that the bill would have
                            to exclude European exports. Well, maybe Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> would be willing to swallow his pride and accept
                            the public humiliation that would be involved. I doubt it. But if he
                            did, elementary self respect would dictate that he get revenge as soon
                            and as plainly as possible and I wonder if we would want to have things
                            go that way. (I have said as much and maybe more to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> and to <persName

                        <p>There is no doubt that in the six months since we started we have made a
                            great deal of progress in our efforts to resolve the textile
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>When we first broached the subject in Europe and the Far East,
                            practically no one was willing to talk.</p>
                        <p>Now most of the countries, including even Great Britain, want to make it
                            clear that they are not refusing to discuss the subject. Some of the
                            European countries have indicated their willingness to help us reach an
                            agreement. Japan and Hong Kong have come to the point of offering us
                            negotiations on a selective basis (certain items only), which of course
                            would be an unsatisfactory and only temporary result.</p>
                        <p><pb n="70" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_70"/>The key is still Japan. I believe
                            they have come a long way in their recent offers of a partial solution.
                            However, it is clear that we need some extra “muscle” to bring them to
                            the table for a satisfactory agreement. If they yield, we should not
                            have too much difficulty with the other principal shipping
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The present threat of restrictive legislation by Congress is important
                            but it is not enough.<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">On January 27,
                                Congressman Wilbur Mills (D–Arkansas), Chairman of the House Ways
                                and Means Committee, advocated negotiated export restraints on wool
                                and synthetic fibers. He warned that protectionist legislation would
                                be unavoidable if a negotiated agreement proved impossible. For

                            business of these meetings will be to agree on a communiqué and other
                            arrangements connected <pb n="71" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_71"/>with
                            Okinawa reversion and to review the range of our common interests and
                            relations, in particular textiles and other trade issues.</p>
                        <p>There are two principal matters to work out with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>—nuclear storage on Okinawa and
                            textiles.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have been rather forthcoming in our intensive negotiations
                            on Okinawa. They are willing to take real political risks by agreeing to
                            positive communiqué language and a unilateral statement by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> regarding post-reversion use of
                            bases on Okinawa and Japan to meet an armed attack on Korea or Taiwan
                            and for continued use for Vietnam if needed. While that language does
                            not assure us completely free use of the bases on Okinawa, it does
                            represent a considerable advance with respect to our bases in Japan
                            proper and we consider it satisfactory. However, Defense feels you
                            should seek in addition a secret understanding with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> on this matter.<note n="2"

                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> said that for
                            some time the Japanese have been negotiating with American
                            representatives concerning the joint statement, and that it was almost
                            ready except for the nuclear issue.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">The
                                “joint statement” is a reference to the communiqué slated to be
                                issued on November 21 after the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                                summit. See <ref target="#d27fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                27</ref>.</note> So far, there had been no indication of US thinking
                            on this issue, and the Japanese had merely been told that it would be
                            decided during the talks between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and the Prime Minister. This problem, he declared,
                            was very important for the Japanese, and the success or failure of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s visit would be decided
                            on this question. For the Japanese, public relations were extremely
                            important, and through conversations with Department of State officers,
                            he had the impression that the important matter of substance on the US
                            side was the introduction of nuclear weapons into Okinawa on an
                            emergency basis. He, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>, had
                            talked with the Foreign Minister, and was given to understand that the
                            Japanese have no disagreement with the US on matters of substance, but
                            that the public relations problem with respect to the joint statement
                            was extremely important—even a slight change in the language of the
                            statement as proposed by the Japanese would be very delicate and would
                            have serious repercussions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that there
                            had been many versions of the joint statement, and he was somewhat
                            unsure to which version Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> was referring. Ambassador Tanaka gave a rough
                            version of the statement as phrased by the Japanese, in which it was
                            stated that the President agreed the reversion of Okinawa would be
                            carried out in a manner consistent with Japanese Government policy,
                            without prejudice to the US position, and without prejudice to the
                            position on <pb n="73" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_73"/>prior consultation
                            expressed in the Security Treaty. Of course, he added, the actual
                            substance would be decided at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            meeting, but the language of the statement was extremely important. The
                            Foreign Minister had studied this problem for a long time, and felt that
                            even having this reference to “without prejudice to the US position” was
                            difficult and the maximum the Japanese could afford. Any change would
                            make the position of <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> very
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said he understood
                            the problem and he had looked at the drafts, of which there have been
                            many—so many that he was becoming an expert on this particular issue.
                            However, the President had reserved the final decision. He, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, understood the
                            Japanese problem, but was under strict instructions. The Department of
                            State had been told that there would be no more negotiations on this
                            issue and no more positions. If anyone were to come up with a proposal
                            for breaking deadlocks, it was to be ignored.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            observed that the President had a high regard for the Prime Minister and
                            had no intention of making his life difficult. Therefore he would
                            approach the issue in a good spirit. As far as Ambassador Tanaka’s
                            comments were concerned, he was glad to have the Ambassador’s views. On
                            the point of whether this was the limit of what the Japanese could do,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> was a good negotiator
                            and wouldn’t tell us anyway what his position was. In any respect, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted, he could
                            not give any indication of our own position until the President had a
                            chance to talk with the Prime Minister other than to reiterate the
                            President’s high regard. The Japanese could be sure he would approach
                            the matter in a constructive spirit.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> stressed that
                            this was a crucial moment for the Japanese. The Security Treaty had been
                            in existence for ten years and there was considerable internal turmoil
                            regarding the Treaty. The Opposition’s objectives were focussing on the
                            Okinawa question, charging that they suspected that the Okinawa
                            negotiations and security relationship would hurt Japan’s interest.
                            Therefore for the first half or more of next year, there would be
                            difficult days in Japan, and the nuclear question would be the center of
                            contention.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that the
                            leftists would be in opposition no matter what, and noted that the
                            Security Treaty had not lapsed but rather had to be denounced. It would
                            be maintained though, so long as it was in the mutual interests of both
                            countries. But he understood the Ambassador’s views very well on the
                            nuclear problem. Again, he reassured the Ambassador that the President
                            was certain to be understanding, and that if the President had any
                            different views these would be presented frankly.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Tanaka reiterated once more the sensitivity of the Japanese on
                            the language of the joint statement, to which Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            <pb n="74" facs="0105" xml:id="pg_74"/>repeated that he could not commit
                            the President who may have different views. At any rate he was glad to
                            have the chance to see <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> and
                            hear what he had to say. At this point Ambassador Tanaka remarked that
                            the proposed draft was “nearly the maximum” of the Japanese position.
                            The reference to prior consultations opened the way for a future
                            relationship. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded by referring to our own Congressional and bureaucratic
                            problems, and we had to see what we could reconcile. But the President
                            knew the Prime Minister, respected him and would approach the issue with
                            good will and a constructive attitude. If there were any differences, he
                            would present them and see what could be done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Tanaka concluded by mentioning that on other questions between
                            the two countries, by which he meant economic matters, the Japanese were
                            really doing the best that they could. The nuclear matter was really the
                            crucial problem. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said he understood and was sorry that he could not have been more
                            communicative.</p>

                            Objectives:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, whom you know from previous
                            contacts, has been generally cooperative and understanding of U.S.
                            viewpoints. He has been Prime Minister for five years and is in a strong
                            political position. With a general election coming up early next year,
                            his two main political problems are Okinawa reversion and student
                            violence, but so far he seems to have handled both to the satisfaction
                            of most Japanese. Japan is enjoying its fourth straight year of
                            record-breaking economic prosperity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Importance of Visit</p>
                        <p>—Healthy U.S.-Japan relations over the near future will probably depend
                            on solution of the reversion issue.</p>
                        <p>—Early solution of the Okinawa problem should provide greater assurance
                            of the long-term viability of our bases in Japan and Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>—Resolution of our textile problem with Japan is essential.</p>
                        <p>—Since Japan is clearly the major Asian power, effective Japanese-United
                            States cooperation is an essential element in all our plans for the
                            defense and development of the region.</p>

                        <p>—The Japanese should better understand that the reciprocity of our
                            economic relationship must be improved by a reduction of Japan’s trade
                            surplus with the world and with the United States. Reciprocity includes
                            Japanese agreement to accelerate the removal of its restrictions against
                            imports and direct investment from the United States.<note n="3"

                            is <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s major objective. He
                            feels this will cement Japan’s ties with the U.S., justify the pro-U.S.
                            path he has steadily followed (including continuation of the Security
                            Treaty), and provide his party with a platform on which to run an
                            election.</p>
                        <p>—Although <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> understands the
                            problem of textile restraint, he has up until now not fully comprehended

                            conventional use after reversion of our bases in Okinawa, we feel the

                        <p>—Another element in the Okinawa negotiations is compensation by Japan for

                            already been reached.</p>
                        <p>—Japanese agreement in principle to restrain its exports to the United
                            States of synthetic and wool textiles has also been conveyed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s secret emissary.</p>
                        <p>—Fuller Japanese awareness that they should assume a larger role in Asia,
                            particularly economic but also political, commensurate with their
                            growing economic strength. We have worked out talking points with Bob

                        <p>With respect to Okinawa, the President said that the key point was the
                            arrangements we could make to meet emergencies in the event of a threat
                            to Okinawa, Japan and the United States. What procedures could we agree
                            to follow? He asked for the Prime Minister’s suggestion on what we could
                            state about this in the Joint Communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">The
                                text of the Joint Communiqué is printed in <hi rend="italic">Public
                                    Papers: Nixon, 1969</hi>, pp. 953–957.</note> to assure <pb
                                n="79" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_79"/>our own people, and second what
                            procedure we could follow with respect to the use of Okinawa in the
                            event of emergencies. He understood that Okinawa would be placed on
                            “homeland level” as reversion took place, but the key question of
                            deepest interest in the Senate, particularly in the Armed Forces
                            Committee, was what would happen in an emergency? These days war could
                            come quickly, and decisions had to be made in two or three days, or in
                            some cases, in two or three hours. Therefore, he proposed to discuss
                            specifically what statement could be made in the Joint Communiqué.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that the President had stated that Okinawa would
                            revert to Japan on a homeland level basis, and said that his government
                            was on record as wishing to apply to Okinawa without modification all
                            the provisions of the Treaty of Mutual Security and related agreements.
                            Under these arrangements, Okinawa would be reverted on a “homeland
                            level” basis. He agreed that Okinawa played an important military role,
                            as the President had noted, and said that his government recognized
                            this. What to do in case of an “important emergency” presented a
                            difficult problem for his government, because it did not wish to see the
                            United States embarrassed subsequently if Okinawa were reverted on a
                            homeland level basis.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that the Joint Communiqué language was most important.
                            While they had no problem understanding each other on this point it was
                            important to consider how both peoples would read the Joint Communiqué.
                            Therefore, he asked for the Prime Minister’s suggestion.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that it was difficult to discuss Okinawa in terms
                            of nuclear weapons because it was not clear officially whether they were
                            present there or not. It was only natural for the Japanese to believe
                            that there were nuclear weapons on Okinawa and he would wish to ask for
                            their removal. He recognized the difficulty of discussing their presence
                            and of making a direct public statement that they had been removed.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was the key point. He hoped that we could
                            work out some understanding, and had prepared some language for the
                            Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then produced compromise language for
                            their consideration.</p>
                        <p>(The Prime Minister passed the Japanese language to the President, who
                            read it in silence.)<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">This exchange of drafts

                        <p><pb n="80" facs="0111" xml:id="pg_80"/>The President said that the
                            Japanese language seemed agreeable as far as his understanding with the
                            Prime Minister was concerned. He could see why the Prime Minister needed
                            such language to deal with the political situation in Japan. However,
                            our own people would require “more precise” language with respect to
                            prior consultations, as drafted by our side.</p>
                        <p>(The President passed the United States language to the Prime Minister,
                            who read it in silence.)</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that there appeared to be a great difference
                            between the two drafts, but he wished to consider how to bring them
                            closer.</p>
                        <p>The President said that something between the two might be agreeable.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the President’s request to have a more
                            precise statement related to the portion dealing with prior
                            consultation? (The Prime Minister then passed the President a second
                            Japanese draft, which the President read in silence; he then nodded his
                            head affirmatively.)</p>
                        <p>The President said that it seemed to say about the same thing; he felt
                            that it would be better, however, in terms of the Joint Communiqué. If
                            the Prime Minister felt that he could sell this language in Japan, the
                            President felt that he could sell it here.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was reluctant to use the term “prior
                            consultation” and indeed this was the only place it appeared in the
                            Joint Communiqué. However, he could accept this language because the
                            United States Government felt that it could better explain away its
                            problems at home by adding this more precise reference to prior
                            consultation.</p>
                        <p>The President said it would be very helpful to have the Prime Minister’s
                            views on how such consultation could take place. The Senate was as
                            deeply interested in this point as was the Diet in Japan. For example,
                            how could such consultations be conducted, how could we react in the
                            event of an emergency such as the recent shooting down of the American
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–121.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> The Prime Minister began to phrase his
                            reply by saying the problem was “introduction in an emergency”, but
                            halted his train of thought and made a fresh start.) The Prime Minister
                            said that the United States maintained that Okinawa’s military
                            capability would be weakened by reversion (although personally he did
                            not think so). Japan itself would oppose any such weakening of Okinawa’s
                            capability in its own interest. Therefore, Japan wished to have Okinawa
                            reverted but at the same time, wished to avoid to the extent possible
                            impairing its military capability. However, Okinawa could not be
                            reverted with <pb n="81" facs="0112" xml:id="pg_81"/>all American rights
                            in tact in their present form; he was obliged to request that the
                            President bear with some weakening.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the means of consultation, the Prime Minister said that the
                            United States had a hot line, and asked whether a link between Tokyo and
                            Washington would provide the opportunity to conduct such consultations.
                            He understood that there were such links between Washington and Moscow,
                            Bonn and London. He could discuss a broad range of problems, beyond the
                            military ones, directly with the President from time to time on such a
                            hot line; but not, he added, too often. This should serve as an
                            assurance.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was an excellent idea. In the Joint
                            Communiqué we could indicate that the hot line would be available to
                            cover the entire area of defense in Asia. In addition, he thought that a
                            hot line between Tokyo and Washington would place the relations between
                            our two countries on the basis of equality it should have, on the same
                            level as England and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether this point should be included in the
                            Joint Communiqué. Personally, he was pleased that the President had
                            agreed so readily to his proposal, but asked how best this point might
                            be handled. Eventually, of course, it would surface, but he did not
                            think it should be included in the Joint Communiqué.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed to this, and to the second Japanese draft of Joint
                            Communiqué language. He suggested that they shake hands on this.
                            Unfortunately, there would be no photographs of this historic
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> The President invited the Prime Minister
                            into his private office to see some photographs of his home in San
                            Clemente, California. Neither interpreter was present.)</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had one other item of good news for the Prime
                            Minister, related to the Mace-B. A recently concluded budgetary review
                            had indicated that there was no longer any need for these weapons, and
                            in about three weeks there would be an announcement of this fact,
                            probably before elections in Japan, which would strengthen the Prime
                            Minister’s position.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked what the press should be told. He assumed that
                            the President would inform Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> of their decision before their luncheon at the
                            State Department today. He did not intend to discuss it with the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Secretary would be so informed before the
                            luncheon.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that press officers on both sides tell the press
                            that the Prime Minister and the President had held an extended
                            discussion of various problems, including Okinawa and Asian affairs, <pb
                                n="82" facs="0113" xml:id="pg_82"/>that these discussions would be
                            continued tomorrow concentrating primarily on the economic field, and
                            that a Joint Communiqué would be released on Friday. The Joint
                            Communiqué would tell the whole story. The discussions were friendly,
                            extensive, and very constructive throughout. However, he suggested that
                            both sides wait until the Joint Communiqué, in which their specific
                            agreements could be announced in one package, rather than releasing
                            specific items piecemeal.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed; and so instructed Akatani, who would serve as
                            the press officer on the Japanese side.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister then invited Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> to join them; <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> was informed of the decision on

                                target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> assumed Y’s friend will say the existing
                            forum should continue. <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> said he thought
                            his friend felt that would be the best way. Y’s friend had already given
                            instructions to his representative and perhaps not in that detail but he
                            will do that. <gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said his friend would
                            raise the issue and explain the importance to Y’s friend. <gloss
                                target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said that would be the first item on the

                            have bilateral discussions to reach an agreement and to reduce to a
                            precise understanding in writing. We will keep the understanding
                            confidential. Right after, you and we together will call for the
                            multilateral thing. <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> was confused on who
                            would ask for the multilateral and <gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss>
                            clarified by saying that we would ask for it. <gloss target="#t_Y_1"
                                >Y</gloss> asked him to make it clear. <gloss target="#t_K_1"
                                >K</gloss> said we would call for one soon after Y’s thing. Then at
                            the meeting you will support us along the lines of the understanding and
                            do your utmost to assist us to achieve a similarly acceptable solution
                            with the others. All of this <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss>’s friend
                            should say. <gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said we understand that
                            what we will arrive at are those figures that we will not mention.
                                <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> asked if the figures will be raised
                            in other places. <gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said no, unless you
                            want us to. We will instruct our negotiators to hold out for these
                            figures, but that is natural. <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> said
                            perhaps K’s negotiators will have much tougher line. <gloss
                                target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> agreed and then they will come in with
                            softer one. <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> wanted clarification again
                            on who would call for the multilateral and <gloss target="#t_K_1"
                                >K</gloss> said we would.</p>
                        <p>Y was confused since K’s proposal gives the impression somewhat
                            different. <gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> thought we would continue
                            with what is already going on. <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> was not
                            talking about the procedure. <gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said the
                            substance remains the same, the procedure differs. <gloss
                                target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> understood and said all his friend <pb

                                target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said he would be coming through a

                        <p>K said as long as Y’s friend says exactly what we have agreed to, he
                            didn’t think he needed to be present. He should not deviate. If he does,

                        <p><gloss target="#t_K_1">K</gloss> said (1) bilateral discussions should be

                            this agreement should be reduced to writing in all the particulars; (3)

                            difficult. <gloss target="#t_Y_1">Y</gloss> asked <gloss target="#t_K_1"

                            only that it was discussed. He said we would phrase it as generally as

                                were found. According to one: “During dinner the Prime Minister
                                noted his pleasure at the recent political success of President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Park</persName> in the Republic of
                                Korea, since he was the ʽonlyʼ leader there who could be trusted.
                                Unfortunately, he said, none of those around him were worthy of any
                                great trust.” (Ibid.) The other noted: “In separate dinner
                                conversations with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Sato, the President
                                noted the value of the experience of his visit to Japan as Vice
                                President in 1953, and said that he hoped to have Vice President

                        <p>During dinner the President asked for the Prime Minister’s evaluation of
                            the situation in Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the situation there seemed to have reverted
                            to the stage which preceded the “rioting and violence” conducted by the
                            Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. As for the prospects for
                            succession, he felt that <persName corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao
                                Tse-Tung</persName> was in ill-health and would not last much
                            longer. Lin Piao was also in poor health, and he thought that Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> might well emerge
                            as the eventual leader. In some ways Chou possessed a decisive manner
                            and broad scope of vision reminiscent of <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                        <p>While its meaning was not yet clear, the Prime Minister said that five of
                            the eleven Japanese imprisoned by Communist China had been released
                            half-a-month ago for no apparent reason.</p>
                        <p>When asked by the President whether the Sino-Soviet split was caused
                            primarily by nationalism, ideology or competition for first place in the
                            kind of hierarchy required by communism, the Prime Minister said that
                            competition for first place was no doubt the major factor, but the other
                            two also contributed. For example, the traditional Chinese concept of
                            “the central flowery kingdom” and the concommitant cultural superiority
                            made it difficult for the Chinese to accept Soviet aid in an early
                            period in their relations. They let the Soviets know that the Chinese
                            were “civilized” and the Russians “barbaric,” which was not helpful.
                            Having created a situation in which they could not accept Soviet aid
                            because it demonstrated an unacceptable position of inferiority, the
                            Soviets, for their own reasons terminated their aid and left. The
                            competition for first place has continued since.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President, the Prime Minister said that he did not
                            believe that the Soviets and the Chinese could resolve their split under
                            the present circumstances, even though they were engaged in the
                            formalities of border talks. Their differences were too deep for a
                            reconciliation in the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>The President explained his view that the United States, itself, and in
                            its relations with Japan, thought it wise not to take sides between the
                            Soviets and the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that outward neutrality was the “wise” policy
                            but suggested that it would also be prudent “behind the scenes” to
                            consider the influence of both powers on other nations, both communist
                            and non-communist. For example, the Government of Japan was concerned
                            over the intransigence of North Korea, which increased with the increase
                            of the Chinese and the decline of the Soviet influence in Pyongyang. He
                            felt that a wise policy designed to renew Soviet interest <pb n="87"
                                facs="0118" xml:id="pg_87"/>and restore its influence in North Korea
                            would be helpful, although he conceded that the Soviets could not be
                            trusted either in view of their actions in the Middle East and
                            Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> proposes to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: (a) that
                            bilateral textile discussions be held to complete an agreement between
                            the two countries and to reduce it to precise understanding in writing
                            as to all particulars; (b) that such meetings use the existing
                            conference at Geneva; (c) that the meetings and the detailed agreements
                            be kept confidential; (d) that the commitments to them would be newly
                            expressed in multilateral meetings held under <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss> and this meeting to be called by the U.S.; (e) that
                            Japan would do its utmost to assist the United States to achieve
                            similarly acceptable solution with the principal interested nations; (f)
                            that the matters in this proposal not be linked publicly by either
                            government with Okinawa negotiations.</p>

                        <p>The proposal is understood to mean: (a) that the initial bilateral
                            agreement and the multilateral agreement that follows are to provide for
                            comprehensive limitations as to all textile products made of man-made
                            fibers and wool and their blends; (b) that the level of such limitations
                            will not exceed the level of such imports into the United States in a
                            twelve months’ period ended no later than June 30, 1969, plus an annual
                            growth factor approximately equal to the growth of United <pb n="88"
                                facs="0119" xml:id="pg_88"/>States market; (c) that the
                            specifications of the final multilateral agreement are to be similar to
                            those now existent in the long-term cotton agreement; (d) that the
                            multilateral agreement is intended to be in effect for a period of at
                            least five years; (e) that the bilateral meetings will result in
                            agreements as to how the two countries will proceed in the multilateral
                            discussions; (f) that the bilateral understandings will all be concluded
                            approximately by the year end; and (g) that it be the joint objective of
                            the two countries to conclude the multilateral arrangements by March 31,
                            1970, their conditions to be effective beginning with full year 1970.
                            The Japanese Government respectfully requests that American Government
                            take a stronger position than this in the talks at Geneva.</p>

                        <p>Bilateral discussions between the two countries should use the Geneva
                            forum and should result in a precise agreement as to all particulars by
                            the end of the year. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> holds himself personally responsible for achieving
                            this comprehensive agreement at Geneva. If the Geneva talks are
                            unsuccessful, he will ask they be recessed. Confidential talks could
                            then be held in another forum to reach comprehensive agreement, which
                            will then be fed back into reconvened Geneva talks.</p>
                        <p>The United States should pursue similar bilateral discussions with Korea,
                            Taiwan and Hong Kong, preparing the way with them for the intended
                            multilateral agreement, but without disclosure to them of any
                            understandings with Japan.</p>
                        <p>At an appropriate time, the United States should issue a call under
                            Article XXII of <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> for a
                            multilateral meeting to negotiate an agreement covering all products
                            made of man-made fibers, wool and their blends, such meeting to be held
                            at as early a date as possible.</p>
                        <p>The United States, with “utmost assistance” from Japan, should conclude a
                            multilateral agreement, along the lines intended, by the end of March or
                            April.</p>

                            reached in yesterday morning’s meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">See

                            wished to discuss the subjects held over from yesterday. He noted that
                            early Japanese press reports on yesterday’s meeting were sensational,
                            probably because the two of them completed their talks the first
                            day.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">(1)</hi> Textiles</p>
                        <p>The President wished to discuss economic problems, beginning with one
                            which presented a political problem for him here just as Okinawa created
                            a difficult one for the Prime Minister in Japan; this problem, textiles,
                            was controversial in both countries, but the President did not wish to
                            allow it to develop into an impasse between them. A number of Senators
                            and Congressmen had in fact already introduced bills to legislate quota
                            restrictions on textile and other imports. He felt deeply that this
                            would harm our bilateral relations with Japan, as well as with other
                            countries. The problem was, however, that he could not beat “something”
                            with “nothing.” He explained to the Prime Minister <pb n="90"
                                facs="0121" xml:id="pg_90"/>that he had pledged during his campaign
                            to seek voluntary restrictions from our friends abroad to avoid
                            legislative controls, even though he acknowledged that this would pose a
                            problem for the Prime Minister, because of the big role played by
                            textiles in Japanese industry. In any case he did not desire any outward
                            indication of a link between Okinawa and textiles.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed emphatically that these two issues must be kept
                            separate.</p>
                        <p>The President said, on the other hand, that he had a political obligation
                            to seek a settlement. He wished to suggest that “at an appropriate time”
                            the United States seek a comprehensive agreement on textiles in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> but had no intention of
                            disclosing the fact of this discussion now, because there would be
                            misunderstanding in Japan even if it were only indicated that he and the
                            Prime Minister had discussed the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that it would not be wise to let it be known
                            publicly that he and the President were discussing textiles.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he also thought that it would be more helpful if
                            the Joint Communiqué contained only general language with respect to
                            trade and capital liberalization. However, he asked the Prime Minister
                            for his views on how to proceed in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss> at a later “appropriate” time. What did the Prime
                            Minister feel that the United States could expect of Japan at such
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he felt strongly that this matter could only
                            be resolved within the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> framework.
                            He added that it was a problem which should have been resolved during
                            the previous Administration, but it had not, and was a subject for
                            discussion between them now.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was a problem which had been left on his
                            desk.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that the previous Administration had left a
                            number of problems to the President for resolution, including Okinawa
                            and textiles. He recognized that textiles were not a new problem because
                            he had discussed them with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> on a previous visit in 1967, and apologized for
                            embarrassing the President by not resolving the issue earlier.
                            Therefore, he himself felt most strongly even before this visit that he
                            must consider this problem seriously, particularly because he had not
                            been able to resolve it in his discussions with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>. Recalling his statement of
                            yesterday, that he was “determined” to consider fully how to resolve the
                            issue, the Prime Minister explained that he was bound by the unanimous
                            Diet resolution against a bilateral agreement on textiles between Japan
                            and the United States, but added that he was free to try to seek <pb
                                n="91" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_91"/>a settlement on a multilateral
                            basis through the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>. However, he
                            cautioned, it would be “nonsense” to seek a meeting in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> to debate this issue before knowing
                            in advance the general trend such discussions would take and the
                            conclusions they might reach on possible solutions. Therefore, he wished
                            to suggest preliminary bilateral discussions of textiles before raising
                            the issue in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>. Japan’s textile
                            industry was self-serving: it initially opposed any proposal by the
                            United States to resolve the issue within the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>, and then later opposed the United States proposal for
                            a bilateral settlement. He realized that he would have to try to “guide”
                            the industry in Japan because its position remained adamant. Even though
                            Japan’s industrial structure was changing, light industry (including
                            textiles) still occupied a strong position. Just as the President was
                            concerned about the strength of the American industry, he also had to be
                            concerned about the industry’s strong position in Japan. What was needed
                            to resolve this issue was complete mutual understanding. After a short
                            pause, the Prime Minister said with strong emphasis, “Let’s do it.”</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that we might lead the matter in this direction,
                            for it would be unfortunate if the United States raised the issue in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> only to be confronted there
                            by Japan. He was confident that he and the Prime Minister could work out
                            a common position, which also would protect their political flanks at
                            the same time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            was established as an international institution to resolve such trade
                            problems, just as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
                            were founded to handle other specialized international matters. In
                            Japan, those who opposed the United States proposals were advocating
                            that it follow the procedures provided under the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> if it wished to seek relief. In
                            response to such statements, he had always said that this would be too
                            rigid an approach, however logical. Instead he always advocated that
                            Japan and the United States, being full partners, resolve the problem in
                            the spirit of sincerity through adequate discussions. Of course,
                            cooperation between the United States and Japan was a prerequisite if we
                            were to persuade the other nations to accept a solution under the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>. Unless both nations agreed on what
                            to do, and how to handle the discussions in <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>, there would be no sense in convening a meeting at the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>; otherwise the only result
                            would be an open confrontation between Japan and the United States. In
                            the end, he hoped to persuade and “guide” the industry in Japan to
                            accept this procedure leading to a solution.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that delegations of both countries were now engaged
                            in such a discussion in Geneva. However, because the United States would
                            raise the issue in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> “at an
                            appropriate time” he suggested that he and the Prime Minister try to
                            work out a common <pb n="92" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_92"/>position
                            beforehand to avoid a confrontation in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>. He did not wish to refer to textiles specifically in
                            the Joint Communiqué, or in statements to the press, lest this prove
                            embarrassing to the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that it would be better to leave out any
                            reference to textiles from the Joint Communiqué, but noted that any
                            statement to the press that they had not discussed such a major
                            bilateral problem as textiles would seem to be a “lie.” He preferred to
                            tell the press that they had discussed textiles, but to take care to
                            keep them separate from Okinawa. He also preferred that preliminary
                            discussions continue in Geneva rather than calling for a new meeting in
                            a new forum, and that any public statements which had to be made be
                            issued in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we would “fuzz it up” in discussing this issue
                            with the press and simply say that he and the Prime Minister had
                            discussed over-all trade questions, and would continue to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that there were strong feelings in Japan that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> simply could not be ignored
                            in seeking to resolve such a complex issue.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we would leave any reference to textiles out of
                            the Joint Communiqué, but he agreed that this would not convince anyone
                            that they had not discussed them.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that no progress could be expected in discussions
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> in the absence of a prior
                            understanding between the United States and Japan. Thorough preliminary
                            bilateral discussions were “essential” to put the President’s suggestion
                            on the tracks, and to work out a common approach to the other countries
                            concerned. Perhaps Japan’s work would consist of leading such developing
                            countries as the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>, Taiwan, Hong Kong
                            and Israel, for as they proceeded to industrialize they would follow the
                            same course as Japan had, and would stress light industry including
                            textiles to begin with. However, it would be an extremely delicate
                            matter for Japan to handle. On the other hand, without the cooperation
                            of Japan, the United States probably could not develop a successful
                            worldwide textile policy.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that the Prime Minister would also cover another very
                            important matter in his talk at the Press Club this noon, Japan’s trade
                            and investment restrictions in general.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> spoke at the
                                National Press Club on November 21 following the conclusion of his
                                visit with <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>.</note> As
                            the Prime Minister knew, a number of American firms wished to have the
                            opportunity to enter the Japanese market, but Japan still had
                            restrictions against American, and indeed any other foreign investment.
                            In view <pb n="93" facs="0124" xml:id="pg_93"/>of Japan’s large
                            continuing trade surplus, any indication by the Prime Minister that
                            Japan was moving toward a more liberal trade and investment policy would
                            be very helpful. Of course, he would not indicate specifically what
                            Japan might do, for it was up to every government and every people to
                            decide its own destiny, but this was a “hot issue” in our economic and
                            industrial communities and both expected the Prime Minister to make some
                            statement while he was in the United States about trade and investment
                            liberalization in general, not about textiles specifically.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> was
                            continuing to implement a “positive” policy for the liberalization of
                            both trade and capital. As Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName> noted during his recent
                            discussions of these matters in Japan, there was dissatisfaction abroad
                            with the slow tempo of Japan’s efforts. However, before discussing this
                            matter, he wished to return to the question of textiles, and attempt to
                            reach some final decision with the President. Noting that the solution
                            of the textile problem being proposed by the United States ran counter
                            to the philosophy and trend toward liberalization, he emphasized the
                            need to conduct full preliminary discussions in Geneva, to the extent
                            possible on an “open” basis. Some matters might have to remain
                            confidential, but to the greatest extent possible these discussions
                            should be “open.” To ensure the success of the discussions in Geneva
                            both governments should cooperate more closely in this preliminary
                            phase. He had issued detailed instructions to Ambassador Nakayama,
                            Japan’s chief delegate in Geneva, before leaving for Washington, but
                            Ambassador Nakayama had reported some disappointment at the trend of the
                            initial meeting. He noted that it had been pointed out to Ambassador
                            Nakayama in new instructions just issued that no talks in the beginning
                            are fully satisfactory, but that these discussions were expected to to
                            maintain an open road to continuing discussions. The direction in which
                            they might lead depended, of course, on the relationship between Japan
                            and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said that perhaps this matter should be thrashed out
                            thoroughly in preliminary talks in Geneva before raising it in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed, noting that some people had proposed a
                            different forum and a different venue other than Geneva, even suggesting
                            a separate conference. He preferred that the current discussions in
                            Geneva continue there. Since secrecy was difficult to maintain, he also
                            preferred that these be as open as possible, although some matters could
                            be kept secret, depending on their subject.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that it was necessary for both governments to
                            continue these talks; if and when they reached a deadlock we could
                            consider an alternate form.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, noting that the United States obviously was anxious
                            to resolve this question as quickly as possible, said that it was <pb
                                n="94" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_94"/>only natural that it would hasten
                            to try to secure a resolution even while he and the President continued
                            to discuss the matter. However, he asked the President to understand his
                            political position, which required that the fact that they had already
                            conducted these “preliminary negotiations” be kept secret. This was an
                            extremely delicate matter, closely related to the dissolution of the
                            Diet and general elections, but nevertheless, he was hopeful that he and
                            the President would resolve this issue.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood these political problems.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also requested that the United States not try to
                            persuade textile producers such as the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> to accept certain proposals by saying that Japan had
                            already accepted them. It was embarrassing to raise such a minor matter,
                            but he felt that it was important to do so. More important, however, was
                            the timing of convening a meeting in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"

                            after a thorough evaluation of the situation.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had in mind “an appropriate time.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he and the President need not decide such a
                            matter, which could probably be left to advisors to determine.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister reminisced about a trip to England he made with former
                            Prime Minister Yoshida some years ago. When an MP from Manchester (a
                            textile competitor) charged that Japan exploited cheap labor, Yoshida
                            responded that post-war legislation prevented such exploitation. The MP
                            then charged that enacting legislation and enforcing it were two
                            different matters. The following day Churchill apologized for this
                            rudeness, but Yoshida cheerfully explained that Japan had been
                            criticized more severely elsewhere, and that he faced even more rude
                            questioning in his own Diet.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he told this story as a reminder that
                            developing nations moved into the production of textiles as the first
                            step toward industrialization. He congratulated the President on the
                            recent Republican Gubernatorial victories, and hoped that his party
                            would be equally successful in the coming mid-term Congressional
                            elections. Personally, he wished to do something constructive to ensure
                            a victory for the President.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it was most important that he and the Prime
                            Minister each understand the problems the other faced; if they did, he
                            was confident that a solution could be worked out, one which the Prime
                            Minister could sell to business and government circles in his country,
                            just as he could in this country. He was confident that they could reach
                            agreement on some middle ground.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he always advocated officially even closer
                            cooperation between Japan and the United States but beyond <pb n="95"
                                facs="0126" xml:id="pg_95"/>that, on a personal basis, he added that
                            it was essential that he and the President fully discuss such matters as
                            textiles. The handwritten letter sent by the President in response to
                            his own congratulatory telegram the night of the election victory was a
                            great source of comfort to him; it was in this spirit of closeness that
                            he wished to continue to discuss directly textiles, or any other
                            problems which might arise.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he explained the difficult matters he would
                            discuss in Washington during an audience with the Emperor on the eve of
                            his departure. The Emperor understood the problems thoroughly, and asked
                            that his regards be conveyed to the President together with his
                            appreciation for the understanding shown Japan by the President.</p>
                        <p>The President appreciated this and asked that the Prime Minister convey
                            his respects to the Emperor, whom he had met in 1953 as Vice
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would report fully to the Emperor the
                            “magnanimous consideration” shown Japan by the President in these
                            current discussions.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled his meeting with the Crown Prince in 1954 in
                            Hawaii.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the Emperor had once visited England, as
                            Crown Prince, to attend a review of the fleet but the Empress had never
                            been abroad. She was growing older, but hoped to make at least one
                            foreign visit. In his own case, he regretted that he never mastered
                            English, even though he travelled abroad as a young man.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that he seemed to understand all the English that
                            was necessary, which reminded him of a story about George Washington,
                            whose hearing failed with age, but of whom it was said that he heard
                            only what he wished in cabinet meetings, and nothing of which he did
                            not.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked that the President understand what he was trying
                            to say with respect to textiles: more and frequent communication between
                            both countries was needed to see where we would be going in any talks at
                            Geneva.</p>
                        <p>The President said that textiles involved several Departments (State and
                            Commerce), and had to be coordinated by the White House. On occasion,
                            therefore, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> might

                            to name.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could call upon Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName>; he was solid, could keep a
                            secret, and enjoyed the Prime Minister’s full confidence.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we could also communicate through Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Meyer</persName>, who enjoyed his full
                            confidence. However, in <pb n="96" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_96"

                            conflicting views of the several departments involved in textiles.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister repeated his request that the United States study the
                            situation thoroughly as the first step toward a solution.</p>
                        <p>The President said “Let’s do something on the textile front”. (<hi

                        <p>The Prime Minister, returning to the subject of liberalization said that
                            some reference to it must be included in the Joint Communiqué but need
                            not be too detailed or lengthy. He asked for the President’s
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had no specific language to suggest. Whatever
                            the working group agreed to would be satisfactory, but whatever was said
                            should be positive. In particular it would be important for the Prime
                            Minister to make a positive statement at the Press Club because many
                            Americans wished to know whether Japan would move toward greater
                            liberalization and our business community was watching every word in the
                            Joint Communiqué, and in the Prime Minister’s every statement, in the
                            expectation that he would make a positive statement while in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President said in terms of the future, 10 or 20 years from now, that
                            both Japan and the United States would be greatly helped by
                            liberalization. The present textile problem was an “aberration.” Both
                            were efficient productive trading countries and would obviously benefit
                            greatly from liberalization. However, there were protectionist elements
                            in Japan seeking to maintain import restrictions and the protectionist
                            elements in the United States were growing stronger. If the Prime
                            Minister could make a good statement on liberalization it would help him
                            (the President) beat down the protectionist sentiment here, and in
                            addition help greatly when he asked Congress to reduce tariff barriers
                            later. However, if Japan, which currently enjoyed such a favorable
                            balance of trade did not relax its restrictions people here would
                            question why we should. The President emphasized therefore that both he
                            and the Prime Minister should move in the direction of liberalization.
                            Apart from textiles, we should move toward freer trade in all areas
                            because Japan was the best overseas customer of the United States, and
                            almost the same thing could be said in reverse, and both of us would
                            benefit even more from freer trade with Western Europe and the
                            developing countries.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed completely. He explained that some Japanese
                            business leaders preferred to speak of “the internationalization of
                            industry” rather than “liberalization”, although both meant <pb n="97"
                                facs="0128" xml:id="pg_97"/>approximately the same thing. He thought
                            this new term was planted among them by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KDM_1"
                                >Kendall</persName> (President of Pepsi Cola) whom he would see
                            Friday night<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">November 21.</note> in New York
                            at Governor Rockefeller’s dinner.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this dinner in New York would be very important;
                            anything constructive he could say there would be most helpful, because
                            everybody there would be a hard-headed businessman like Mr. Mizukami,
                            and would wish to hear what the Prime Minister had to say.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that everyone on the guest list seemed to be a
                            supporter of the President’s party.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also noted that he met Mr. Townsend (Chrysler) at the
                            White House last night; they talked briefly about the
                            Chrysler–Mitsubishi joint venture.</p>
                        <p>The President said that representatives of the Big 3 in the automobile
                            industry usually attended such dinners.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">(3)</hi> Japan’s Role</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thought that the Joint Communiqué might also refer to
                            the Agreement on Peaceful Space Cooperation and to technological
                            exchanges.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in this new era in our relations both should
                            recognize that over and above our responsibilities for the future of
                            each of our nations and own interests, we also have a greater
                            responsibility for the shape of the world and its economic and political
                            institutions. He thought that Japan was now at a point where it could
                            play a greater role consistent with its domestic situation not just in
                            Asia but also on the world scene. He did not indicate what the
                            Government or the people of Japan should do, for each nation should
                            choose its own destiny. However, as he said after dinner last night, he
                            did not believe the Japanese people would long remain satisfied to play
                            only the role of a self-sufficient, highly productive, rich economic
                            giant. As Herman Kahn predicted, Japan might well exceed all of us in
                            per capita income by the end of this century but more important than
                            clothing, housing or television was the role the people could play
                            beyond this.<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5">Herman Kahn, a strategic
                                theorist and futurologist, worked on a study during 1966–1967, which
                                circulated within the U.S. Government and predicted that the
                                Japanese economy would continue to grow faster than the rest of the
                                developed world and that Japan would emerge as an important actor in
                                world affairs. Kahn’s findings were later published in his books <hi

                                1970).</note> He felt, therefore, that Japan should move to a
                            “higher posture” in the area of trade, investment, political development
                            of Asia and, to the extent that <pb n="98" facs="0129" xml:id="pg_98"
                            />we can agree, between us even in security. We would welcome this, and
                            judging from his talks with other Asian leaders the President knew that
                            they would also welcome Japan’s playing such a role. As he said
                            yesterday, the world would be healthier if Japan could be added “as a
                            fifth finger” to the four existing areas of great power, the United
                            States, Western Europe, the Soviet Union and China.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had been deeply moved by the President’s
                            remarks after dinner last night, but he was not convinced that Herman
                            Kahn was correct about Japan’s future. To draw an analogy, the United
                            States had already finished first in a marathon race, and the Soviet
                            Union second, but the spectators were anxiously looking to see which of
                            the runners bunched in the pack far back would come in third; Japan
                            might be slightly ahead of the other nations in the pack, but it was far
                            behind the first and second countries that had already finished.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that Japan was “coming up fast” and, assuming little
                            change in conditions Japan’s per capita income would increase greatly.
                            The Soviet Union was tied-up in its bureaucratic system, and in any case
                            had never really had a high level of per capita income, and American
                            productivity was not increasing as it should, although we hoped to do
                            better in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister hoped that the Japanese people understood that they
                            owed much to the United States for their progress; personally, he was
                            firmly convinced that Japan was deeply indebted to the United States for
                            its assistance and cooperation, which have made possible Japan’s great
                            economic progress. He could understand how some Americans, from their
                            point of view, might distrust Japan; after the United States opened
                            Japan to the world a century ago and helped it to make great progress
                            toward modernization during the Meiji period, Japan fought a war against
                            the United States and lost. Japan must do its utmost to restore the
                            trust it thus lost. Reaffirming the President’s statement of yesterday,
                            he agreed that the world would be more secure if the number one and
                            number two nations in the Free World cooperated more closely; it was
                            exactly such closer cooperation based on mutual trust which he sought to
                            achieve, and his political destiny was to fight against the Socialists
                            and Communists whose ideology placed them in opposition to this.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had discussed Japan’s possible future role at
                            great length with Mr. McNamara, who felt that Japan was already playing
                            a crucial role in the Asian Development Bank. With respect to the
                            development of Southeast Asia in the post-Vietnam period, the President
                            noted that Japan had already expressed a willingness to cooperate in the
                            development of the Mekong River basin and both North and South Vietnam.
                            The United States would be pleased <pb n="99" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_99"
                            />to cooperate if Japan would assume the leadership in this area, since
                            it would be far better to have an Asian nation take the initiative
                            rather than the United States. He asked the Prime Minister about his
                            views on what Japan might be able to do, for example, could Japan call a
                            conference to discuss such a program.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he too had hoped to discuss this very matter
                            in view of the importance of the post-Vietnam period. He recalled that
                            it had been quite a shock to Japan, the enemy, to hear that the Allied
                            Powers were preparing their post-war Japan policy during the height of
                            World War II. All attention was now focussed on withdrawing military
                            forces from Vietnam, but it was equally important to discuss and decide
                            on post-war programs now. A “master plan” for the post-war period was
                            essential and if one were made known to the enemy it might blunt his
                            present hostility. If the United States wished to call such a
                            conference, Japan would gladly participate. This need not be done
                            immediately, but it was important to announce a post-war goal with
                            “vision”, for the adversaries in Vietnam, including for example the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>, and all other nations in the
                            area would be deeply affected by the end of the war.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Prime Minister thought Japan could call
                            such a conference in Tokyo during the summer or fall of 1970. There was
                            some feeling here that such a conference could not discuss an economic
                            development program, including certainly the post-war development of
                            Vietnam without involving all the participants in the war. It would be
                            helpful if Japan, the leading nation in Asia, and in particular the
                            financial leader, could initiate such a conference. Of course he would
                            not suggest that the Prime Minister do anything harmful to his own
                            position in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would certainly be willing to consider
                            the possibility. As the President knew, Japan’s policy was devoted to
                            peace under the peace constitution and Japan was well known as a
                            peaceful nation. The natural forum to discuss post-Vietnam programs was
                            the Ministerial Conference for Asian Economic Development, an
                            organization which met first in Tokyo several years back and now looked
                            forward to its fifth regular meeting in Djakarta. The post-Vietnam
                            period could well be discussed in this forum, since the other nations of
                            the area which participated also needed assistance. The Asian
                            Development Bank would also present an appropriate forum because of the
                            key role it would play in financing any programs. If the President had a
                            specific proposal in mind, the Prime Minister was sure that it could be
                            discussed at the fifth annual Ministerial Conference in Djakarta. He
                            noted that the United States also played a large role in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ADB_1">ADB</gloss>, with its large subscription; the
                                <gloss target="#t_ADB_1">ADB</gloss>, widely thought of as a second
                            World Bank, could benefit from additional contributions. Perhaps
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> would have
                            some ideas.</p>
                        <p><pb n="100" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_100"/>The President said that a shift
                            to multilateral financing of aid projects was essential because of the
                            unpopularity of bilateral assistance in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the situation would have been far more
                            difficult without economic assistance. Be that as it may, the withdrawal
                            of United States troops from Vietnam would greatly affect such nations
                            as Thailand as well as the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>, which
                            also had contributed many troops.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the real point was that all the developed nations
                            should understand that realistic aid would be good business for them
                            because at present they traded largely among themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that we all preferred to associate with the rich
                            rather than the poor.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">(4)</hi> US–<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Relations and Vietnam</p>
                        <p>The President, if the Prime Minister desired, wished to present his
                            evaluation of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks and the
                            prospects in Vietnam. Without intending to involve Japan in either, he
                            wanted the Prime Minister, as a world leader, to know what we had in our
                            mind to help him correctly interpret our future actions. At the time of
                            the inauguration the President said that we were entering an era of
                            negotiations with the Soviet Union, instead of confrontation, but these
                            negotiations have not produced much. In a discussion of the
                            nine-month-long era of negotiation with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in
                            October he recalled telling the Ambassador that not much progress had
                            been made in the Middle East or Vietnam or on other pending issues. In
                            confidence he told the Prime Minister that he had jokingly told the
                            Ambassador that nine months was long enough to have a baby, but so far
                            we have had only a series of miscarriages in our talks with the Soviets.
                            The President said that his own evaluation of the Soviet line was that
                            it was temperate in official statements but “hard” in action. The
                            Soviets have not helped significantly to cool off the situation in the
                            Middle East, nor were they playing much of a role in trying to get the
                            North Vietnamese to negotiate seriously in Paris. He said this not in
                            anger, but more in sorrow.</p>
                        <p>The President further noted that United States and the Soviets would
                            ratify the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> on Monday, which would
                            be announced then. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                                >SALT</gloss> was moving forward. There was much naive talk that the
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> would result in the control
                            of the development of arms by the United States and the Soviet Union,
                            but he explained that our purpose was to achieve a limitation on the
                            production and deployment of missiles, which would reduce the burden of
                            arms on our economy as well as reduce the danger to the world. We had to
                            negotiate hard and realistically, however, because this was for the
                            “blue chips.” What had deterred the Soviet Union and Communism <pb
                                n="101" facs="0132" xml:id="pg_101"/>in general these past twenty
                            years was American nuclear power. At the time President Kennedy made his
                            decision during the Cuban missile crisis the United States lead over the
                            Soviet Union in strategic missiles was 8 or 10 to one, but subsequently
                            the Soviets had closed the gap and at the present they were equal in
                            numbers, and probably ahead in weight; the United States was stronger on
                            the sea and in the air. For this reason he felt he had to make a
                            decision to go ahead with the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss>, to
                            prevent the Soviets from achieving strategic superiority by making a
                            breakthrough in defensive missiles. He noted that he could not accept a
                            unilateral ban on the <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRV</gloss>, as some
                            dove Senators insisted, for if the Soviet Union MIRVed their missiles
                            and we did not, they would automatically gain a 5 times or 6 times
                            advantage over the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President did not state this as a rigid, war-like statement, but
                            simply to describe a fact of international life. United States policy
                            has always been, and would always be that it would never use nuclear
                            weapons except in defense. The United States had no ambition to expand
                            at the expense of other countries; for example it was not in Vietnam to
                            create an American South Vietnam but to ensure that the South Vietnamese
                            could create their own South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the new Soviet leaders differed somewhat from the
                            old ones, but it should be borne in mind that they were still
                            Communists, and still had the aim of conquering the world, although not
                            through war because they understood full well that it would destroy both
                            sides. However, he emphasized, if one side was committed to expansion
                            and conquest of the world, and the other side to the defense of all the
                            individual nations to choose their own course, we must be certain that
                            the United States retained its ability to defend itself and other
                            nations against such expansion by conquest, and that the United States
                            not be placed in a position of inferiority against those who wish to
                            expand their system throughout the world, which they could do without
                            war if they enjoyed such superiority by threats and blackmail.
                            Therefore, we owed it to ourselves and to the other nations under the
                            American security umbrella to bargain in good faith but
                            realistically.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation and complete agreement. The
                            Soviet Union was indeed a Communist state and had not abandoned its idea
                            of world conquest. Further, it had a very strong tendency to place its
                            own interest first. For example, it continued its “unnatural occupation”
                            of Japan’s northern territories, the return of which the people of Japan
                            desired as strongly as they desired the return of Okinawa, but whenever
                            the Government of Japan raised this issue the Soviets refused to
                            negotiate on the grounds that it had already been settled permanently.
                            However, he did note some recent changes in Soviet attitudes toward
                            Japan, such as agreeing to permit Japan Air <pb n="102" facs="0133"
                                xml:id="pg_102"/>Lines to fly its own aircraft on the air route
                            across Siberia, beginning next year. The Soviets were also interested in
                            securing Japanese assistance to develop Siberia, but nothing had been
                            worked out yet because the Soviets were reluctant to provide the
                            Japanese necessary access.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he continued to adamantly refuse to accept a
                            Soviet invitation to visit Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The President said “someday, perhaps.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said “that day will never come.”</p>
                        <p>The President noted his interest in these matters, pointing out that
                            Soviet refusal to discuss the northern territories stood in contrast to
                            his own discussions with the Prime Minister about Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted bitterly that the Soviets did not even fight
                            Japan for the northern territories, but simply occupied them after the
                            war was over.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">(5)</hi> Steel</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister wished to raise one additional point today, the steel
                            industry voluntary agreement to restrict exports to the United States.
                            Leaders of the steel industry, who were concerned that some small steel
                            companies in Japan were not living up to the voluntary agreement, called
                            before his departure for Washington, to request the Prime Minister to
                            convey to the President their wishes that the “flames of the textile
                            problem” not be allowed to spread to steel. It was important to note the
                            sincerity of the industry because of the organization of the New Japan
                            Steel Corporation through the merger of Japan’s two largest steel
                            producers (Fuji and Yawata) thereby creating perhaps the world’s largest
                            producer of steel.</p>

                            concrete proposal. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> said we
                            should agree in Geneva, keep the agreement secret, then the Japanese
                            would call a <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> meeting at which to
                            say what we agreed on in Geneva. R said he’s got a problem, because his
                            Diet says he can’t enter into discussions. R said they are willing to
                            enter into it when we can show that American industry has been harmed. R
                            said you know that would be quite a while. <gloss target="#t_K_1"

                            it’s after the election. R said well, we still have a lot of bargaining
                            power. R said we must get congressional approval. <gloss target="#t_K_1"
                                >K</gloss> said the P has broken his back to meet his commitment. R

                        <p>K said he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> and

                        </list>
                        <p>The President opened by explaining the burning desire among the Japanese
                            for the reversion of Okinawa, and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s understanding of the security value of Okinawa to
                            the Japanese as well as to the US. The President then declared that he
                            appreciated the need for consultation with the Congress on handling
                            Okinawa reversion, and referred to the need for legislation on this
                            matter. However, we did not yet know what type of legislation would be
                            needed to handle Okinawa’s reversion. Continuing, the President
                            discussed US-Japanese trade issues, noting recognition on the part of
                            the Japanese that their interests were better served if they moved in
                            trade, aid and investment matters rather than maintaining their present
                            position. He also explained that due to the Japanese sensitivity on
                            Okinawa, no indication could be given that we received any quid pro quo
                            on Okinawan reversion, and had to treat each issue separately. The
                            President then called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> for comments.</p>
                        <p>The gist of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>’
                            remarks was that the agreement we had reached with the Japanese had
                            turned out very well—so much so that it would be hard for him to
                            describe just how good it was. He called on Under Secretary <persName

                            the agreement (which had been reached with the Japanese in principle)
                            into an actual document covering all aspects of reversion, and he
                            estimated that it would be mid-1971 before final agreement on the
                            details would be reached. Our objective was to turn over Okinawa in 1972
                            conditional on completion of the detailed agreements; hence we had not
                            lost our bargaining leverage over the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The President requested Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> to amplify why it was that settling the Okinawa
                            question would help out in the use of our bases in Japan. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> explained jointly
                            that the agreement gave us a wider legal basis on employment <pb n="106"
                                facs="0137" xml:id="pg_106"/>of the bases due to the language in the
                            Joint Communiqué providing for the use of the bases against aggression
                            in the Far East, in order to carry out treaty obligations. This was an
                            extension over the previous area of coverage.</p>
                        <p>Congressman Rivers questioned whether the bases on Japan would actually
                            be used to such an extent, in response to which the President said, as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> knew very
                            well from his service as Ambassador to Japan, the questions of Okinawa
                            and nuclear weapons were very emotional in Japan. Nevertheless, on the
                            issue of defense of the region, Japan needed to play a greater role.
                            This would come, but would take some time. Japan was the second ranking
                            economic power in the Free World, and therefore must play a greater role
                            in terms of defense contributions. In <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>, who was likely to remain in power, we had a man
                            who recognized the facts of life, and in the atmosphere of mutual trust
                            established in the reversion talks we could work toward a goal in which
                            Japan would take over a much greater burden. We would accomplish our
                            purpose without pushing and dominating.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> mentioned that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> planned to call general
                            elections soon and get another mandate. He would probably do very well.
                            As far as Japan’s role in defense was concerned, with anyone else than
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, e.g. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>, we would find ourselves in a much
                            less favorable position.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had been in Japan, and knew <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> as a man committed on our side in
                            the broadest sense—he understood the problems of the region and was
                            sophisticated. Most important, in him we had a man who would use the
                            Okinawa agreement as a basis for establishing the future role which
                            Japan should play. This would not be a nuclear role, but would involve a
                            bigger contribution on the economic side and a greater military
                            responsibility for Japan’s own defense. Japan would also help other
                            countries militarily by means of economic aid.</p>
                        <p>Congressman Rivers stated that the Congress of course had to back the
                            President up. He termed the President the only man able to deal with the
                            economic problems the Japanese posed for us. Militarily, his Committee
                            had a stake in the reversion question, which was therefore not
                            exclusively a responsibility of the Foreign Relations Committee. The
                            President would not hear that he had said anything critical on the floor
                            of the House. He reiterated that “we must back you up”. There would be
                            complications, but the best interests of the country were being served.
                            He wondered, though, whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                                >Laird</persName> was happy. He expressed pleasure in hearing that
                            the Japanese under <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> were more
                            cooperative.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> cited the
                            Communiqué as reaffirming the Japanese intention of continuing the
                            Security Treaty indefinitely. On <pb n="107" facs="0138" xml:id="pg_107"
                            />this score, the President said that he thought we had reached an
                            agreement which was the best we could get at this time. What was the
                            important thing was implicit in the Communiqué rather in the words
                            themselves. He had spent more time with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> than with any other head of Government and was
                            convinced that we would make progress.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> brought up the
                            subject of financial arrangements connected with the Okinawa return, and
                            said that we were quite satisfied with what we had received.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> referred to the
                            fact that we had built a tremendous military base on Okinawa, and had
                            also made a tremendous investment there [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>]. We had not wanted this responsibility,
                            but had to take it. The significant thing about the Communiqué and the
                            Prime Minister’s Press Club speech was that we would of course retain
                            our nuclear capability through 1972 and could use it prior to that time
                            if conditions did not improve in Asia and the Chinese Communists
                            developed a nuclear threat.<note n="3" xml:id="d34fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d31fn3">footnote 3, Document 31</ref>.</note> He agreed
                            with previous remarks concerning Japan’s growing recognition that it had
                            a role to play. In the event our nuclear weapons were moved out, [<hi
                                rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>]. He supported the
                            President in saying that this was the best agreement that could have
                            been worked out, and after the 1972 time period, with recognition on the
                            part of the Japanese people and Government of their Asian military role,
                            additional arrangements could be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> raised a
                            question concerning the dollar costs involved in Okinawan reversion.
                            Would the Japanese payments be for our investments already there, or for
                            replacement facilities? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> replied that the Japanese would pay for some
                            installations which they took over on Okinawa and also would pay the
                            costs of moving nuclear storage facilities to other areas. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> commented that we
                            were keeping the amounts in general terms. The President confirmed that
                            this point had been covered in his conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, but he did not want anyone
                            present to say so. He hoped that everyone would understand why.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1"
                                >Wheeler</persName> and asked him to give the views of the Joint
                            Chiefs. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> declared
                            that the Joint Chiefs frankly preferred a status quo position because of
                            the nuclear aspect. If the status quo were not possible, they would like
                            to have seen specific language in the Communiqué providing for emergency
                            re-entrance and transit rights. He was glad to see that the Communiqué
                            contained language which would have the effect of preserving these
                            rights. As to the impact of Okinawan reversion, he could assure <pb
                                n="108" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_108"/>those present that with some
                            added constraints, all of the operations we had been carrying out from
                            Okinawa could be handled from other locations in <gloss
                                target="#t_WESTPAC_1">WESTPAC</gloss>. Relocation would reduce to
                            some degree our flexibility, including our reaction time, depending on
                            the nature of the contingency. However, the Joint Chiefs had concluded
                            that relocation would not pose any insoluble military problems.</p>
                        <p>Speaker <persName corresp="#p_MJW_1">McCormack</persName> asked what was
                            meant by “insoluble.” General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1"
                                >Wheeler</persName> explained that while we would need to adjust
                            contingencies and readjust reaction times, we still would be able to do
                            the job. In response to a further question from Speaker <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJW_1">McCormack</persName> on examples of what was
                            meant, General <persName corresp="#p_WEG_1">Wheeler</persName> mentioned

                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was
                            one of the rare Japanese who had a world view. With respect to
                            Sino-Soviet problems, and also European problems, he was very
                            sophisticated.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Scott</persName> asked if the
                            President was in a position to tell US business leaders that
                            negotiations were proceeding on trade and economic matters. The
                            President answered affirmatively, pointing out that the previous day’s
                            announcement after the talks had primarily dealt with economic matters.
                            Discussions would continue, and he was hopeful in this respect.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> referred to
                            paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 of the Communiqué as handling economic topics.
                            They pointed out that the Japanese did not wish to appear as bargaining
                            to get their sovereignty back, and therefore <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s Press Club speech and the Communiqué, while
                            making clear what he intended to do, would not make economic measures
                            part of the bargain. They pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> had major problems in Japan in this regard. We had
                            gotten a lot from <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and would
                            get more.</p>
                        <p>Senator Stennis referred to the President’s various statements on Asian
                            policy, saying that he had made clear how our policy was changing. With
                            respect to our position on responsibility for the defense of Japan
                            itself, though, he wanted to know how the Japanese could be brought into
                            line. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> explained
                            that the Security Treaty remained in effect, and the Japanese now would
                            assume a greater share in the defense of Okinawa. Meanwhile our own
                            capabilities would not diminish. Senator Stennis asked if we should get
                            a statement from the Japanese that they would increase their
                            contribution to their own defense. Should we meet this issue head on?
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> replied that
                            the Communiqué stated our security commitments were essential to the
                            defense of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Senator Stennis reiterated that we had to start somewhere in getting them
                            to assume a greater share and wondered if we were not bargaining away
                            our leverage on the Japanese through Okinawa’s reversion. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> then outlined
                            Japan’s defensive capabilities, <pb n="109" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_109"
                            />bringing out that by 1975 Japan would be spending 1.5% of its <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> on defense. This would be $5 or 6
                            billion annually, about the level of Germany and France, and above that
                            of Italy. He ventured a guess that when the pendulum started to move, it
                            might move faster than we liked. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                                >Laird</persName> observed that Japanese contributions were
                            improving. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>
                            added that the Communiqué took this whole issue into consideration.
                            Prior to 1972 we would certainly urge the Japanese to do more.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he could respond directly to Senator Stennis’
                            apprehensions. In his first day’s discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, he had gone into the doubts in
                            Congress and in the country as a whole over the burden the US was
                            carrying in Asia, not only in Vietnam but elsewhere. He had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> the time had come for
                            the Japanese to assume a greater burden in defending Okinawa and Japan.
                            The reference to the use of bases in Japan with respect to Korea and
                            Taiwan was a step in that direction. The Japanese defense budget had
                            also been discussed. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> had
                            said that the Japanese could not acquire nuclear weapons but could do
                            much more in the field of air power and sea power. The President, too,
                            felt that they might move faster than we anticipated and faster than
                            others might want. However, he had the utmost confidence in <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, and believed that Japan would not
                            want to be just a big economic force. The Japanese wanted to play a
                            world role in providing economic assistance, and would assume a military
                            burden greater than that of their own defense. They had already moved
                            considerably.</p>
                        <p>Congressman Rivers declared that he would explain these problems to
                            Congress and would say that the President was telling the truth.</p>
                        <p>Speaker <persName corresp="#p_MJW_1">McCormack</persName> commented that
                            the Japanese simply wanted an umbrella, but not the expense. The
                            President explained that the Japanese did indeed have problems,
                            including opposition from leftists and Communists, but were a proud
                            people who wanted to play a bigger role.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> stated that he
                            did not want to leave the record completely bare of any word from him.
                            In his opinion the President was accepting the inevitable in a graceful
                            way. There was no real choice, and what the President did was to make
                            the best possible choice. The sooner the President liquidated
                            obligations left over from World War II, the better off we all would be.
                            The country would be broke unless the President were to do so. Okinawan
                            reversion was a step in the direction which the Symington Subcommittee
                            was trying to move our policy as a whole. With respect to the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee, the President would have no trouble, since
                            he was moving in the direction the Committee wanted to move. As for
                            himself, he said he hoped we would not threaten anyone with nuclear
                            weapons. In conclusion, he stated that “what you are doing is the right
                            thing.”</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed confidence that he would handle the
                            questions at the Press Club this noon very well. The fact that it was
                            known that he did not understand English well would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that several textile industry representatives had
                            “shown their faces” last night, but he did not see them because he did
                            not wish to receive any petitions during this visit. He expressed deep
                            gratitude to the President for his “magnanimous” decision on Okinawa,
                            and also for the President’s agreement to treat Okinawa and textiles
                            separately. For this very reason, therefore, he felt deeply his own
                            responsibility with respect to textiles. Already this morning he had
                            explained to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AK_1"
                                >Aichi</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST_1"
                                >Shimoda</persName> how this matter should be handled. First, and
                            foremost, his agreement with the President should be kept “absolutely
                            confidential” and not announced to the press. By the end of December,
                            however, he promised the President that this matter would be resolved.
                            He urged the President to feel free should any problem arise to discuss
                            it with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shimoda</persName>, to
                            whom he had given a thorough explanation of what should be done. He
                            pledged to the President to bear the full responsibility for reaching a
                            solution.</p>
                        <p><pb n="111" facs="0142" xml:id="pg_111"/>The Prime Minister agreed that
                            it would be desirable to resolve the issue through “comprehensive”
                            discussions, but noted that the word “comprehensive” had gradually
                            acquired an unpopular nuance through previous use; to eliminate possible
                            public misunderstanding in Japan its use was gradually being eliminated
                            in the present talks in Geneva. Its “revival” at this point would
                            inappropriately counter the trend of the discussion by the American and
                            Japanese sides in the Geneva talks, in which the Japanese initially
                            advocated a solution limited to the “elements” which were a problem but
                            the Americans advocated the inclusion of all “elements,” i.e., a
                            “comprehensive” solution. The differences between both sides in Geneva
                            were being narrowed in their discussions of the problem. He felt that
                            the general desires of the United States could be achieved, but both
                            sides needed to engage in further discussions. It seemed to him that the
                            best course was to have the staff-level representatives continue their
                            discussions. Initially it was thought that the fact that these
                            discussions were taking place in Geneva ought to be kept secret, but
                            there was no need to keep them secret now that this fact was known
                            publicly. The experts on each side might differ in their opinions, and a
                            “deadlock” might be unavoidable at some point, necessitating a recess of
                            several days. However, any attempt to hold new discussions in a new
                            forum in a new place would create a “misunderstanding” in Japan. He
                            cautioned that he and the President could keep their own discussion of
                            textiles secret, but the delegates in Geneva were in daily contact with
                            the press and could not keep every aspect of the talks secret. Therefore
                            it would be helpful to make a clear decision as to which matters of
                            substance could be announced, and which could not. Naturally, nothing of
                            substance should be disclosed while the talks were in progress. If this
                            kind of procedure were agreeable, he was confident that a solution could
                            be achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Ambassador Nakayama, a career Foreign
                            Ministry official who was serving as chief delegate for Japan, had
                            sufficient rank to exercise responsibility, but the Ministry of
                            International Trade and Industry (<gloss target="#t_MITI_1"
                            >MITI</gloss>) was represented by an official of lower rank; as soon as
                            he returned to Japan, the Prime Minister said, he intended to replace
                            him with a higher-ranking, more responsible <gloss target="#t_MITI_1"
                                >MITI</gloss> official, who could help lead the matter to a final
                            resolution. He had explained his position at length before going on with
                            their discussion because he wanted the President to understand the
                            points he had outlined above.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it was important that the United States and Japan
                            reach a meeting of the minds by the end of December, because the United
                            States did wish to present this matter to the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss> with an understanding between our two countries.</p>
                        <p><pb n="112" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_112"/>The President said that he had
                            told Congressional leaders in a security briefing earlier this morning
                            that there could be and was no understanding on textiles.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d35fn2">See <ref target="#d34">Document 34</ref>.</note>
                            They clearly understood that there was no direct link between Okinawa
                            and textiles, although there would be broad references to economic
                            matters in the Joint Communiqué, as well as in the Prime Minister’s
                            speech at the Press Club today. That was how he answered that question
                            by the Congressional leaders.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for this.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it would be most helpful if the Prime Minister
                            responded to questions at the Press Club luncheon in a similar manner.
                            Of course, he would have to say that their discussions covered the broad
                            range of economic issues, including textiles, but there would be no
                            disclosure of their understanding on textiles. The “appropriate time” at
                            which the United States would raise this matter in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> could also be determined by the
                            current discussions between both countries.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the matter of the word “comprehensive” was more
                            difficult. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> and
                            the Department of Commerce felt strongly that there should be a
                            “comprehensive agreement” but how to interpret this was a matter open to
                            discussion. He hoped that the two nations could reach as broad as
                            possible an agreement at Geneva, because he faced a practical political
                            problem on this, just as the Prime Minister faced a practical political
                            problem with respect to Okinawa. He referred, of course, to our textile
                            people; and in this area the language was perhaps more important than
                            the substance, and our own people were pressing for a comprehensive
                            agreement. He would appreciate it if the Prime Minister would cooperate
                            as much as possible to work out an agreement as comprehensive as
                            possible, rather than a “selective” agreement, which would pose a
                            serious problem for him here.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, having noted well the President’s statement, and
                            having explained that he had not entered into a commitment limited to
                            this time and this place, committed his sincerity and all of his efforts
                            to achieve a solution to this problem. It was his “personal credo” to do
                            what he promised. There would be difficulties in solving this issue,
                            particularly with the textile industry in Japan, which was no easier to
                            handle than the American textile industry; but the Prime Minister said
                            that “he could vow” to devote his full efforts to achieve the agreement
                            the President desired. “Please trust me”.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was “good enough” for him.</p>
                        <p><pb n="113" facs="0144" xml:id="pg_113"/>When the President shook hands
                            on it with him, the Prime Minister said that “mutual trust” was
                            important.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister then asked about the reaction of the Congressional
                            leaders to the nuclear issue.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this worked out well. Secretary <persName

                            Joint Communiqué language on prior consultation was adequate to deal
                            with security problems. Some leaders, particularly on the Senate Armed
                            Services Committee would raise questions, but they would not represent
                            the prevailing sentiment. Japan’s recognition, in the Joint Communiqué,
                            of its responsibility for the defense of Okinawa, and to the security of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> and Taiwan was most
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">3.</hi> Japan’s Larger Role</p>
                        <p>The President said that several Congressional leaders had asked him
                            whether Japan was ready to play a larger role in defense (excluding
                            nuclear weapons) beyond the borders of Japan. In response to them, he
                            had said that he and the Prime Minister had discussed that matter, on
                            which basis he felt confident that Japan would play a continuing greater
                            role in the economic and defense areas (once again, excluding nuclear
                            weapons), as the Prime Minister had said to him.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that national security was the primary
                            responsibility of the political leader of any one nation. Therefore, he
                            was fully aware that we must have a “good agreement” on Okinawa which
                            would help Japan maintain its own security. He confessed that he
                            sometimes jokingly said that no one knew how United States-Soviet
                            relations would develop in the future, “and perhaps someday the United
                            States might have to re-occupy the islands”. (<hi rend="italic"

                            Minister said to his interpreter “That was a joke; I hope the President
                            understood that it was a joke”.) After all, Japan and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had a Treaty of Non-Aggression in
                            1945, and the Soviets had no cause to declare war on Japan, but they
                            attacked and occupied Manchuria.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he and the Congressional leaders shared the
                            strong feeling, now that we had resolved the last great issue arising
                            out of World War II, i.e. Okinawa, that the United States would welcome
                            Japan playing the role it ought to play in the world, not just in the
                            economic areas, but in security areas as well, as he had already told
                            the Prime Minister. He understood that the Prime Minister had budget
                            problems, just as he did, and a political problem created by those who
                            wished to make Japan defenseless to the Soviet Union and <pb n="114"
                                facs="0145" xml:id="pg_114"/>Communist China. The United States
                            would continue to play a major role in the Pacific, but it should not
                            play the predominant role there. In viewing Asia, the British, French
                            and Dutch were gone, and Germany was too late to get in. In the new
                            Asia, the only powerful free world nation there to play a role in Asia
                            was Japan. Therefore, he had directed his staff advisors to work out a
                            solution to Okinawa, to permit Japan to do more to play a strong role in
                            Asia. This would be healthy for both the United States and Japan, and as
                            a result for the world.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister, turning to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>,
                            said that there had been no change in Japan’s position based on the
                            strong national sentiment against nuclear weapons, which had been
                            conveyed to the United States by the Foreign Minister. Therefore, he had
                            not prepared a new, and strong statement to make on nuclear weapons at
                            this time. However, he felt that it was not necessary for Japan now to
                            decide in haste to sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. If the
                            United States felt that it required early Japanese signature he hoped it
                            would so inform the Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would not press for this. Each must do so in
                            its own time, when it felt it best to do so. If he came to feel
                            differently he promised to inform the Prime Minister. Japan was a
                            sovereign state and should make this decision itself. He had told the
                            Germans the same thing. However, the United States would sign the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> on Monday, as he had said earlier; the
                            press had not yet been so informed.</p>

                        <p>The President hoped that the Prime Minister would read carefully his

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the President’s speech had greatly
                            encouraged the nations of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Japan should not be involved in our problem in
                            Vietnam, but he wished to explain the reason why he felt that he should
                            take a strong stand. If the United States ended the war there in a way
                            which would humiliate the United States, or which was, or could be
                            interpreted as a defeat of the United States, and a victory for the
                            communists and North Vietnam, it would mean that the United States would
                            come home from Vietnam, but he feared that it would also mean that the
                            United States would come home from the world. Therefore, all the free
                            nations had a stake in whether the United States <pb n="115" facs="0146"
                                xml:id="pg_115"/>could end the war with honor, so that the people of
                            South Vietnam could choose freely their own future, as did the Koreans
                            in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was convinced that a continuing United
                            States presence was absolutely essential. While great difficulties
                            remained to be resolved, the situation in Vietnam seemed to have slowly
                            become calmer. He expressed admiration and respect for the President’s
                            courageous policy.</p>

                        <p>The landslide victory of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan’s December
                            27 general election went well beyond the most optimistic forecasts.
                            Together with a strong decline in socialist strength, it will undercut
                            the opposition’s “1970” campaign against the US-Japan Security Treaty
                            and will help Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                            >Sato</persName>’s efforts to develop a clear popular consensus favoring
                            the alliance with the US as the best current answer to Japan’s security
                            needs.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s position in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> has been greatly strengthened: He can
                            now be reasonably certain of a fourth two-year term as <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> president next fall, thus promising
                            continued leadership that is both stable and basically sympathetic to
                            the US. He will be freer to take initiatives on sensitive issues (e.g.,
                            signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> and controlling student
                            violence) than would have been the case if the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1"
                                >LDP</gloss> increases had been less spectacular (the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>, expecting to do little more than hold
                            its own, actually picked up 28 seats while the Socialists lost 44.)</p>
                        <p>In foreign policy, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is likely
                            to fulfill a campaign pledge by trying to open Warsaw-style talks with
                            Peking, not so much in serious expectation of any early Chinese response
                            as to deprive the opposition parties and his rivals in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> of the China issue. He may also step
                            up pressure on the Soviets for the return of the four Japanese-claimed
                                <pb n="117" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_117"/>islands in the southern
                            Kuriles, thus contrasting Soviet intransigence with US reasonableness on
                            Okinawa and helping line up Japanese national feeling behind the
                            alliance with the US.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Role of Nationalism.</hi> Perhaps the most significant
                            aspect of the election was the nationalist feeling demonstrated by the
                            electorate and its rejection of ideological bickering and fuzzy
                            idealism. The victorious parties—the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1"
                                >LDP</gloss>, Komeito and Japan Communist Party—clearly appealed to
                            nationalism. On the other hand, the Socialist Party—saddled with its
                            traditional platform of unarmed neutrality as well as a public image of
                            gratuitous involvement in Sino-Soviet ideological disputes and an almost
                            total lack of internal discipline—suffered a stunning defeat. The poor
                            showing of the Democratic Socialist Party (a gain of one seat and loss
                            to the Komeito of its psychological vantage point as the second largest
                            opposition party) was largely caused by its failure to project a clear
                            and emotionally appealing image to the electorate. The Communist Party’s
                            success in recent years in shedding the image of a foreign agent and in
                            assuming a nationalist garb was an important factor in its gains (it
                            added 10 seats for a total of 14). Its influence on national policy
                            however, will remain minimal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Impact of the Elections.</hi> Even though the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> majority has increased and the other
                            opposition parties have gained at the expense of the Socialists, the
                            impact on politics, especially in the Diet, will be mostly
                            psychological. <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> morale will be
                            boosted by its spectacular gains, which reverse a long but gradual
                            decline. Its popular vote dropped slightly but far less than the 2.8%
                            average loss in the last six general elections. The new cabinet which
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will form in early
                            January will probably be as broadly representative of <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> factions as the present cabinet. Even
                            though the Socialists remain the largest opposition party in the Diet,
                            their quixotic hope to lead the opposition against the Security Treaty
                            and to end the long rule of the Conservatives has been shattered. How
                            they iron out their problems will not be known until the party
                            convention in March but it is likely that the present leadership will be
                            replaced. The greatly strengthened Komeito (to 47 seats from 25) is
                            likely to concentrate on popular issues and will probably extend its
                            campaign to reduce the US military presence in Japan to include US
                            forces in Okinawa.</p>

                                countries of Southeast Asia. It also suggests a “regional economic
                                meeting” intended to create “a sense of regional identity and
                                cooperation” in Southeast Asia. There is no indication that this
                                letter was ever sent.</note> which embodies some of these
                            approaches. The letter is given some immediacy by a recent telegram from
                            Tokyo (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">Telegram 48 from Tokyo,

                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was “visibly shaken” by
                            Senator Javits’ enthusiasm for disengagement from Asia. A letter from
                            the President may be important to still any doubts that we are planning
                            to leave Japan holding the bag for Asian security.</p>
                        <p>One problem which we face is that, when we sign the agreements on
                            Okinawa, we shall have solved the last “easy” problems with Japan.
                            Okinawa was inherited from World War II, and its eventual return was
                            envisaged long ago. However, complex trade and economic issues are very
                            much with us and involve real and powerful US interests. In addition, we
                            are trying to move Japan into assuming a more responsible regional role
                            supplementary to our own involving political, military, and economic
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>Another problem arises at this point: the fact that Japan is by no means
                            welcome in all Asian quarters. Not only is there still a legacy of
                            suspicion regarding Japan left over from World War II, there is a much
                            more contemporary resentment of Japan due to the hard bargains which the
                            Japanese drive in conducting their economic relations. As our own
                            relations with Japan grow closer, we will need to do what we can to
                            avoid identifying ourselves too much with Japan so as to preclude
                            anti-Japanese sentiment being directed toward us as well. We will also
                            need to do what we can to nudge the Japanese into practices which will
                            ease Asian suspicions and resentments.</p>
                        <p>I assume that the best way to develop specific proposals is to examine
                            those areas in which our relationship is cooperative or at least not
                            directly competitive:</p>

                        <p><pb n="120" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_120"/>The most obvious gesture would
                            be a Presidential visit to Japan exploiting the last-named common
                            interest. The impact could be maximized by relating it to Okinawan
                            reversion formalities in 1972. If present trends continue, the students
                            should not pose an insuperable problem, and this itself would provide a
                            useful contrast to the Eisenhower debacle in 1960.</p>
                        <p>Participation in a regional economic meeting provides another and more
                            immediate possibility. This relates to the suggestion which the
                            President made in November that Japan take the initiative in organizing
                            a meeting to consider post-Vietnam economic reconstruction in Southeast
                            Asia. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was interested, but
                            deferred consideration.</p>
                        <p>Various targets of opportunity may develop for us to line up with Japan
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and other international
                            negotiations, on issues important to Japan. Coordination of China policy
                            is one possible example. Another is the Russian occupation of Japanese
                            territory since World War II. The Japanese may eventually get angry
                            enough about her northern territories to raise the issue in
                            international forums. With Okinawa behind us, we can be very pure on
                            this one, and derive the satisfaction of knowing that the Soviets
                            probably cannot accommodate the Japanese since it would create a
                            parallel regarding Chinese claims. Raising the issue thus helps to
                            exacerbate Sino/Soviet difficulties. (Any action in this category has of
                            course to be weighed against the disadvantages incurred in US/Soviet and
                            US/China relations.)</p>
                        <p>You instructed that no reference be made in this draft to the current
                            US/Japanese textile negotiations. Since you passed that instruction,
                            however, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCF_1">Bergsten</persName> has sent
                            you a memorandum underlining the urgency of getting some forward
                            movement on the textile issue. He suggests that a letter without even an
                            oblique reference to textiles might suggest to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that the President does not really
                            attach much importance to the matter. <persName corresp="#p_BCF_1"
                                >Bergsten</persName> therefore suggests, and I agree, that you
                            consider expanding paragraph two of the draft along the lines of the
                            underlined sentence below:</p>
                        <quote><p>“Now that 1970 is with us, I believe that the indications all

                                to a deepening of our close relations. <hi rend="italic">This will
                                    surely be the case if we can quickly implement the agreements

                                therefore. . .”</p></quote>
                        <p>Finally, I should note in passing that a reference to Japanese signature
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> may be in order, if the
                            Japanese either have signed it or are on the verge of doing so at the

                        <p>Harry Dent asked me to be sure that you were informed of the President’s
                            meeting on textiles with Senator Thurmond on February 19.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d40fn2">No other account of Thurmond’s meeting with the
                                President has been found. On February 16, Ken Belieu, Deputy
                                Assistant to the President for Senate Relations, sent a memorandum
                                to <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Peter Flanigan</persName> that
                                stated, inter alia: “The major part of the textile industry is
                                located in states that supported the President in 1968. Failure to
                                achieve a solution of the textile import problem in the relatively
                                near future could make it very tough going for our Republicans this
                                year especially in South Carolina and Georgia. A solution of the
                                problem could also be very important in Alabama, where Wallace is
                                strong and critical of the Administration.” (Ibid., [2 of
                            3])</note></p>
                        <p>The Senator informed the President that we have less than a month to
                            negotiate voluntary restraint agreements. The American Textile
                            Association starts its annual convention on March 17 and will decide at
                            that time to press for quota legislation—in alliance with the shoe and
                            perhaps other interests—if we have not obtained a solution ourselves.
                            Dent feels that the textile people would not back off after making such
                            a decision, and that the Administration would then have to support quota
                            legislation to uphold the President’s campaign commitment.</p>
                        <p><pb n="123" facs="0154" xml:id="pg_123"/>The President reaffirmed his
                            commitment to Senator Thurmond and wondered aloud whether Secretary

                            to Tokyo. I gather that the Secretary feels that he must have a
                            Presidential letter for <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to
                            make the trip worthwhile.</p>

                            he had agreed with the President last November to attempt to solve the
                            textile question as soon as possible in order to avoid damage to
                            U.S./Japanese relations. He added that there was no agreement on the
                            specific way of solving the problem, which he hoped could be handled
                            through friendly talks, but he would respect Diet resolutions opposing
                            the U.S. government proposal. This is the first public indication the
                            Prime Minister has given of his textile commitment to the President.</p>

                        <p>After three weeks in Japan, attending two conferences, traveling widely,
                            and talking to a lot of people from senior officials to newsmen and
                            ordinary citizens, I came away with the impression that U.S. relations
                            with Japan are in very good shape. The Okinawa settlement of last
                            November is recognized by everyone, even the left wing, as a remarkably
                            astute and effective piece of diplomacy. Just about every Japanese I
                            talked to felt this agreement had put our Security Treaty with Japan on
                            a solid footing and had greatly reduced the chance that our bases might
                            become a political issue. Japan today is stable and <pb n="124"
                                facs="0155" xml:id="pg_124"/>prosperous, considers that in the
                            decade of the 60’s it settled its basic political and economic problems,
                            and looks forward to the 70’s with confidence and assurance.</p>
                        <p>Textiles is the one real issue in our relations and is beginning to hurt.
                            All Japanese make much of the arguments that their exports of synthetics
                            constitute merely one per cent of U.S. consumption and that we have not
                            made a case that Japanese exports are doing injury to the U.S. industry.
                            Our position gets very little credence, even though Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH_1">Meyer</persName> has worked very hard in
                            presenting our case.</p>
                        <p>I was struck by several other points. Most Japanese including
                            conservatives want to explore every avenue for bettering relations with
                            Peking, though they will nearly all agree Japan should retain good
                            relations with Taiwan. There is considerable concern that the U.S. may
                            through the Warsaw talks somehow get ahead of Japan in improvement of
                            relations with Peking (despite Japan’s $600 million trade with the
                            mainland last year and high level mission it now has in Peking). I spent
                            an evening with Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName>, who may well be Prime Minister within ten
                            years, and his views support the general impression that Japan has no
                            desire to acquire nuclear weapons or to greatly expand its defense
                            forces. He is incidentally very eager to come to Washington soon to talk
                            over defense planning and the situation in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>A word about EXPO. It is a great show, livelier and better coordinated
                            than the other two world fairs I have seen. The U.S. pavilion is the top
                            attraction; even though it is quite unprepossessing from the outside,
                            our exhibits are in good taste and low key, topped off by the Apollo 11
                            spacecraft and a moonstone, with Babe Ruth’s uniform for good measure.
                            By contrast the Soviet exhibit is enormous, must have cost three times
                            the money, and as one Japanese said is like a department store with
                            everything in it. The hotel and traffic situation at EXPO is in good
                            shape but the waiting lines for everything are long, averaging several
                            hours for the U.S. pavilion.</p>

                            Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and Secretary

                            selective, as opposed to comprehensive, restrictions that the Japanese
                            government was offering in the textile negotiations. Dent declared that
                            the textile leaders “have just run out of patience with and faith in the
                            Japanese,” and would begin lobbying to restrict textile imports unless
                            they received evidence that the President would act to protect their
                            interests. (National Archives, Nixon Presidential Materials, <gloss

                            institute quotas on cotton, wool, and synthetic textiles. <persName

                            17 memorandum. (Ibid., White House Central Files, Box 43, [EX] CO 75,
                            1/1/70, 1 of 3) On May 2 Mills and Representative John Byrnes met with
                            Secretary of Commerce <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>.
                            According to <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>’ memorandum of
                            conversation, Mills said that he “felt committed to the textile industry
                            to secure restrictions on imports of wool and manmade fiber textiles and
                            apparel.” He planned “to introduce textile import legislation which
                            might encourage exporting countries to cooperate with our efforts to
                            secure a multilateral agreement,” and hoped to do so before May 9, when
                            Mills left on a trade mission to the Far East. (Ibid., White House

                            to you his deep regrets at not having been able to resolve the textile
                            issue during the time span he had pledged, and he reiterated his

                            involved in efforts to seek an arrangement, and he proposes very limited
                            top secret contacts to pursue the matter. Agreement should first be
                            found between our governments. He would then see to it that his textile
                            industry would accept it and expects that you [<persName

                        <p>On May 11, in anticipation of administration witnesses testifying in a

                                >Nixon</persName> established the administration position in regard

                            on imports of woolen and synthetic textiles. <persName

                            listed three options: first, that the administration explicitly oppose
                            the mandatory textile quotas in the Mills bill at this time; second,
                            that the administration defer taking a stance in regards to the bill’s
                            mandatory textile quotas; third, that the administration indicate that
                            while it prefers a negotiated solution, such a solution can not be
                            assured, and that it therefore does not oppose Mills’ textile quota
                            legislation. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> initialed his
                            approval of the second option on May 11. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s memorandum also describes which

                        <p>On July 9, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> met with Mills
                            and others about pending trade legislation. During this meeting, Mills
                            said that only some segments of the U.S. textile industry had been hurt
                            by imports. “In an aside, [Mills] remarked to the President that they
                            had both been fooled by the textile industry, which had no case for
                            overall protection.” (Memorandum of conversation; ibid., Nixon

                                >Rogers</persName> that analyzed the Japanese reaction to the Mills
                            bill, describing it as a mixture of pride over Japan’s refusal to back
                            down in the textile dispute, and disquiet at the long-term effect on
                            U.S.-Japanese relations. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                            Representatives passed the Mills bill in September 1970, but it died
                            there because the Senate did not pass it before adjourning on December

                            simultaneously: (1) how to move some munitions as rapidly as possible;
                            and (2) whether these particular stocks are essential to our chemical
                            capability and overall military posture as directed by National Security
                            Decision Memorandum 27.</p>
                        <p>Attached at Tab A is a proposed memorandum to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> for your approval.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d43fn7">Attached but not printed.</note> It first states
                            that we should move some munitions as soon as possible and should not
                            wait until selected sites can hold the entire stocks.</p>
                        <p>It then asks for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                            >Laird</persName>’s appraisal of the Magnuson amendment in the Senate
                            (Tab E) and his appraisal of the importance of these munitions in
                            relation to our chemical capability and <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                                >NSDM</gloss> 27. It concludes: If these stocks are not essential,
                            would it be to our advantage to announce plans to detoxify them on Guam
                            or elsewhere? It requests his assessment of these matters by June 8.</p>
                        <p>Since there is no requirement for forward deployment of these munitions
                            on Guam, and since there appears little reasonable justification for
                            choosing Alaska as the site, the option to announce plans to detoxify
                            the munitions should be considered. For such consideration, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName>’s assessment of the
                            situation is required.</p>

                        <p>In the attached memorandum and paper, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> presents his views on our present
                            economic relationship with Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">Attached,
                                but not printed, is a May 18 memorandum from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. An unattributed paper
                                entitled “Japan’s Economic Growth: The Basic Anatomy,” from April is
                                also attached but not printed. This paper provides the basis for
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>’ May 18 memorandum.
                                It raises the prospect that Japan will achieve “world economic
                                supremacy” through a combination of hard work, a skilled labor
                                force, intelligent policies, neglect of the public sector, and a
                                disregard of international obligations.</note> He expresses his
                            concern that economic and financial considerations have been
                            subordinated to geopolitical and military factors in the development of
                            our policies regarding that country. Neglect of these considerations in
                            our overall policy-making may account for unsatisfactory results in
                            recent trade negotiations with Japanese officials. He believes that
                            continued rapid economic growth in Japan will increase the importance of
                            these economic considerations and the weight they should be given in the
                            development of our long-term policies and relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>As background for a major re-examination of policy which he feels is
                            necessary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> has
                            initiated studies on Japanese government–industry–banking relationships
                            and the Japanese import control regime to determine their impact on U.S.
                            trading and investment interests. He will report when these studies are
                            completed and on further actions he feels should be taken. Treasury has
                            similar studies underway on the impact of current Japanese economic and
                            financial policy on the international monetary system and the U.S.
                            balance of payments.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> said that he was making a
                            one-month trip around the world, and during this trip had started
                            thinking that it was time for Japan to identify a new world role for
                            itself. In East Asia and Southeast Asia he had two things in mind:
                            Japanese relations with Communist China, and Japan’s role in the
                            stability and welfare of Southeast Asia. Regarding China, Japan was not
                            in the position to offer its good offices in improving Sino-U.S.
                            relations, but it could influence the Chinese with respect to the
                            outside world and bring it into the international community. The way for
                            Japan to do this was to engage in expanded trade and exchanges with
                            China. Turning to Southeast Asia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                                >Miki</persName> felt that Japan should expand its trade, but also
                            should be aware of human elements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                                >Miki</persName> favored Japan’s establishing a full-scale peace
                            fund, which would provide technical training and assistance in public
                            health.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to what extent Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> thought the U.S. would
                            advance its relations with Communist China? What the Japanese did
                            depended on this. What kind of a relationship with China did Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> see by the end of
                            the 70s? Concerning Southeast Asia, did Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> think that other nations might be invited to
                            participate in Japan’s peace fund? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                                >Miki</persName> indicated that he had done a great deal of thinking
                            about bringing in nations of the Pacific Basin together in this,
                            particularly the U.S., Canada, and Japan.</p>
                        <p><pb n="131" facs="0162" xml:id="pg_131"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> wanted to say, first, that he was delighted to
                            see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s good friend, Hubert
                            Humphrey, had recommended Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                                >Miki</persName> highly and had recommended a meeting. On relations
                            with China, we had not undertaken initiatives to normalize these
                            relations, and had only made a small beginning. Recent events had caused
                            a temporary interruption in our contacts, but Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> believed that these would
                            resume. There would be no spectacular events, and he didn’t know if any
                            government had strong enough nerves to negotiate with China and North
                            Vietnam simultaneously. Nevertheless, by the end of the 70s our
                            relations certainly would have improved.</p>
                        <p>As far as Japan was concerned, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> declared that we would have no objection to
                            the Japanese seeking to improve their trade relations with China and to
                            help China get out of its isolation so long as this was within a general
                            framework of friendly relations with the U.S. In Southeast Asia,
                            Japanese aid in economic reconstruction was very important.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that an
                            immediate problem was Cambodia, where we would like the Japanese to do
                            more. Japanese security there was more threatened than that of the
                            United States. It was the general philosophy of this Administration that
                            mutual aid among Asian nations was desirable, and Japanese help for
                            Cambodia would be consistent with the Nixon Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> stated that in the field
                            of the economic cooperation, one of the most important factors was the
                            technological capability of the local people, who are often not trained
                            to operate factories. Did Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> believe it would be possible to expand
                            cooperative measures among the Pacific nations through such measures as
                            providing training and programs for students? Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he was familiar
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>’s idea about the
                            Pacific Basin, and we would be willing to cooperate in such as those Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> had described. The
                            President was extremely interested in student exchanges, and would look
                            on these favorably in principle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> if he wouldn’t elaborate
                            more on the prospects of the Sino-U.S. relationships in the 70s. In
                            response, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked
                            that a great deal depended on the Chinese, with whom no one had managed
                            to establish good relations except Albania. In principle, we were
                            willing to go into the concurrent issues of how to improve relations,
                            which was better than dwelling on ideological issues. A reasonable
                            Chinese leadership should recognize that we had relatively few issues
                            with the Chinese. There was, of course, Taiwan, but this could be healed
                            in time. Except for Taiwan, we didn’t have clashing interests. Others
                            more close than we, especially the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, had more clashes. Whenever a more rational leadership
                            evolved, which <pb n="132" facs="0163" xml:id="pg_132"/>would be after
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao</persName>, it would be possible to
                            go faster. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> wondered how
                            we might deal with Taiwan. What solutions could we foresee? Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted in this
                            respect what Palmerston had said about the Schleswig-Holstein question;
                            only three people understood it, one of whom was mad, one was dead, and
                            he was the third but he had forgotten the answer. However, a formula
                            could be found to deal with the issue. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> emphasized, though, while we would support any
                            settlement which the Chinese parties made with one another, we would not
                            betray an ally.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> said he had been in
                            Saigon, and had exchanged views with Saigon leaders and with other Asian
                            leaders, all of whom had expressed a certain degree of concern over the
                            future if the U.S. continued to withdraw from Vietnam as scheduled.
                            There might be an effect on the Vietnamese presidential elections if the
                            U.S. troops in Vietnam were much less than now. Thieu’s own concerns
                            represented a common feeling—what kind of a formula for a settlement
                            could be found if the U.S. withdrew? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> wondered how it was that the Japanese had
                            gained a reputation for indirection; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                                >Miki</persName> had gotten right to the heart. On this issue, we
                            thought that after some period of time the South Vietnamese should be
                            strong enough to defend themselves, and this would give the North
                            Vietnamese two choices: either to settle now or wait until the high
                            point of South Vietnamese strength had been reached. If this were to
                            happen, the North Vietnamese might not be able to win even if they
                            fought for seven years more. On the other hand, if they were willing to
                            reach a political settlement, we had said we were prepared to have one
                            which reflected the existing balance of forces. If the North Vietnamese
                            were ready to be realistic, we could reach a conclusion. However, they
                            wanted us to withdraw and overthrow the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1"
                                >GVN</gloss> on the way out—this was too much to ask.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> said that the war had
                            been going on for over 20 years, and that Japan was seeking to find
                            things to do to get a settlement, even though its means were limited. As
                            to the war, Japan was anxious to shift energies from the war to peace
                            and reconstruction. Since Japan had only limited influence while the war
                            was going on, it felt that something had to be done. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked, what was Japan
                            thinking of doing? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>
                            replied that they had in mind something towards a peaceful settlement.
                            The Japanese public was pressing the government, but the government was
                            not too sure what it could do.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that Japan
                            couldn’t do much towards a peaceful settlement in Vietnam. However, in
                            situations like Cambodia, which was a neutral, independent country, help
                            would be greatly welcomed. This would be in the interests of everybody
                            in Southeast Asia. We ourselves have no bases there and were not
                            interested in staying. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>
                            noted that Japan had made some contributions to Cambodia previously,
                            such as in constructing dams.</p>
                        <p><pb n="133" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_133"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                                >Miki</persName> asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> for his views on the future of the U.S.-Japan
                            security treaty, especially in the light of the Nixon Doctrine. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> described Japan as
                            being the greatest country in Asia and potentially the most powerful.
                            Therefore, Japan could and should carry a greater burden of its own
                            defense. It was not a healthy situation for the U.S. to carry the whole
                            burden, especially when other countries could contribute. Because Japan
                            was so important, we could not be indifferent to Japan’s role, and we
                            took the Treaty very seriously. This Treaty, though, had to be at least
                            as important to Japan as it was to us, since we could defend ourselves
                            alone and Japan couldn’t. We were delighted to have the Treaty and
                            certainly would not abrogate it; on the contrary we would strengthen it.
                            It was up to Japan to decide what Japan did, and we felt that Japan
                            would come to realize that the Treaty would allow it to keep a lower
                            defense budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> remarked that the U.S.
                            had strongly urged Japan to join the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss>, and Japan was determined not to develop nuclear power,
                            therefore, it was important to have U.S. nuclear weapons behind it. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, saying
                            that Japan was so important that we couldn’t permit it to be destroyed
                            in a nuclear war. This was not an act of charity; we did it for
                            ourselves. If half a billion Chinese were added to the Soviets, there
                            would be a tremendous shift in the balance of power in Asia. We did not
                            believe in a sentimental foreign policy, but were acting in what we
                            considered to be Japan’s and our own interests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> asked if Japanese land
                            forces would have any deterrent effect in Asia. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that as a historian he
                            believed that history indicated that Japan land forces would grow. Was
                            he wrong on this? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> agreed
                            that there would be a growth in the Japan defense forces, but he was not
                            thinking of Japan as a major military power. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we would
                            nevertheless like to see Japan play a more important role in Asia. This
                            need not be primarily in the military field—the level of Japan’s defense
                            was something that the Japanese should decide for themselves. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> remarked that there were
                            certain parties in Japan which wanted Japan to become militarily strong,
                            but the opinion of the majority was that the country should not move to
                            become a major military force. When asked by Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> why this was, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> explained that Japan had become
                            what it is today by not obliging itself to become a big military power.
                            Japan had the experience of militarism in the last war, and public
                            opinion had not forgotten this. Otherwise it would be extremely
                            difficult for Japan to secure national unity. Needless to say, though,
                            the Japanese people were aware of the need to help in the defense of
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that with
                            respect to the level of military forces, certain tasks had to be
                            performed in the Pacific. If the Japanese were to put more emphasis on
                            economic aspects, and see more on the <pb n="134" facs="0165"
                                xml:id="pg_134"/>military side, this would be satisfactory division
                            of labor. We might want to discuss changes in emphasis from time to
                            time, but for now this was an acceptable picture.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that he
                            had been in Japan only twice; in 1951 just to pass through and in 1960
                            to spend two days.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> corrected this sentence.
                                He crossed out “just to pass through.” In place of “to spend two
                                days,” he wrote, “for three weeks each time. He had also passed
                                through Japan in ʽ65 &amp; ʽ66 on the way from Vietnam.”</note> This
                            had been going to and from Vietnam. Therefore, he had had no real
                            opportunity to see Japan. However, he had many Japanese students, such
                            as <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName>, Yoshino, and Fujita,
                            and had many friends. He had played with the idea of going to see EXPO
                            70 this September, but probably couldn’t make it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> wanted to raise one last
                            question: after the reversion of Okinawa to Japan, and our relationships
                            were entering into a new stage, what should we do to solidify and
                            strengthen these relationships. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied that our relationships were very good
                            now and had a solid basis. We should maintain our present relations, and
                            not try to duplicate each other’s policies but to reinforce them. He was
                            impressed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>’s ideas
                            about the Pacific Basin, which he recognized would bring peace in the
                            Pacific. He reiterated that we didn’t need to do the same things but
                            should have the same goals. He personally believed that Japan should
                            play a greater role in Southeast Asia. Again, it was not right for some
                            nations to do all the work. Others should stand by their side. Japan
                            could play a real part in the post-war economic reconstruction and
                            development of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>
                            recalling that he had seen the President twice as Foreign Minister and
                            hoped that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> would
                            convey his very best wishes to the President.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Note</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has said that
                            in the 1970s Japan must face the “problem of national power”—a concept
                            which he has defined as the “aggregate of a country’s political
                            stability, economic strength, military might, its sway over
                            international opinion, its cultural heritage, and so forth.” In this
                            Estimate we look at how these several aspects of Japanese national life
                            are likely to evolve and interact during the decade, and at some of the
                            implications for the US.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Japan enters the 1970s with the world’s most dynamic economy, a
                            population proud of its accomplishments, and a moderate government
                            firmly in the political saddle. Its problems during the coming decade
                            will be how to use its riches and growing self-confidence to improve
                            standards of living at home and to find a suitable role for Japan
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>B. The chief arena of political competition will continue to be within
                            the Liberal Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>), and
                            it is here that the most significant new pressures will make themselves
                            felt. In the long run, the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> can
                            probably maintain its commanding position only if it meets mounting
                            pressure for attention to Japan’s social infrastructure needs,
                            especially in the booming cities. In the process, support for the party
                            itself is likely to change markedly from conservative rural
                            constituencies to the urban middle classes.</p>
                        <p>C. Japan is in a strong position to continue rapid economic growth,
                            although sooner or later a decline from the past average real growth
                            rate of 10 percent a year is likely. But while Japan’s strength and <pb
                                n="136" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_136"/>influence within the
                            international economic complex will continue to increase, so will the
                            dependence of Japan’s prosperity on continued access to foreign markets.
                            A prolonged international recession or the imposition of severe foreign
                            trade barriers by Japan’s main trading partners would have grave
                            economic repercussions in Japan, all the more so because its economic
                            system is geared to rapid growth.</p>
                        <p>D. Japan’s search for a “world role” will focus initially on gaining
                            international status and recognition through, for instance, an enhanced
                            role in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and on continued efforts
                            to promote Japanese economic interests abroad. By the end of the decade,
                            Japan will be more nearly an equal in its economic relations with the
                            US; is likely to be the dominant external factor in the economic life of
                            non-Communist Asia and the largest external economic influence in China,
                            Australia, and New Zealand; and in all likelihood will be the greatest
                            single economic rival of the US even in such traditional American
                            preserves as Latin America.</p>
                        <p>E. Politically, economically, and emotionally, Japan is attracted to the
                            developed nations, particularly those of the Pacific Basin—the US,
                            Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Its economic role in East Asia gives
                            it a major stake in the stability of that region. Its foreign aid to
                            East Asia will increase substantially, accompanied by growing economic
                            and eventually political influence. In Southeast Asia, however, Japan
                            will try to keep its political activity in a multilateral context. Even
                            in Northeast Asia, where Japan will engage in increasing bilateral
                            exchanges on intelligence and internal security with South Korea and
                            Taiwan, it will want to avoid political or security involvement which
                            might provoke North Korea and especially China.</p>
                        <p>F. All Japan’s Asian policies will be fundamentally affected not only by
                            its relations with the US but also by its reading of the balance among
                            the US, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and China. The Japanese
                            think they have an independent “bridge-building” role to play between
                            the Communist and non-Communist powers in Asia. And to some extent they
                            count on mutual antagonism among the three great powers to help Japanese
                            influence with each one. They will be persistent in friendly overtures
                            to China, and reluctant to engage in any activity which could be
                            construed as “anti-Communist.”</p>
                        <p>G. The Japanese defense related industries will grow substantially over
                            the decade, though the Self-Defense Forces probably will increase only
                            gradually with primary emphasis on air and naval forces. The navy and
                            air force will extend their area of operations, and eventually will come
                            to accept a greater share of responsibility for defense of <pb n="137"
                                facs="0168" xml:id="pg_137"/>Japan’s vital lines of communications.
                            But Japan will not want to station troops abroad or to accept foreign
                            military commitments, certainly not bilateral ones.</p>
                        <p>H. We are less certain about Japan’s nuclear future. The issue will be
                            the subject of growing national debate, and the decision will be
                            affected not only by Japanese sentiment <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>
                            but also by US and Chinese policies. On balance, we think that unless
                            the Japanese come to feel some imminent threat to themselves for which
                            US protection is deemed unreliable, they probably will not decide to
                            produce nuclear weapons at least for some years to come.</p>
                        <p>I. Japan will want the US military presence on its lands reduced and want
                            a greater Japanese voice in the use of the forces which remain. But so
                            long as it is ultimately dependent on American military protection, it
                            will on balance probably want some US military presence on its territory
                            to give force to the American commitment. Economic issues are likely to
                            be a greater source of friction than US military bases. Most important
                            of all, as the decade goes on, Japanese governments will be increasingly
                            eager to demonstrate—to other Asians and to their own electorate—that
                            their policies are independent of Washington’s.</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>“Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Maurice Stans</persName>,
                            Secretary of Commerce of the United States, visited Japan last year, the
                            problem of restraints on exports to the United States of wool and
                            man-made fiber textile articles has been continuously and earnestly
                            discussed between our two Governments. The problem is most difficult and
                            complex, but it has been my strong conviction that no problem between
                            our two countries is too difficult to solve, if approached in the spirit
                            of mutual trust and friendship, as has been demonstrated in the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>“I have given serious thought to the course of discussions that have
                            taken place for more than a year, and to various difficulties in your
                            country, as well as to the positions taken by the Diet and by the
                            industries concerned of my country. Considering that further delay in
                            solving this problem is not desirable for both countries, I have now
                            come to a conclusive thought for the solution of this problem.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> noted that the

                        <p>“First, the textile problem is to be considered a special and exceptional

                            the emphatic endorsement of all of our Ambassadors. It is now our
                            problem to put this into effect in a period when we have continuing
                            commitments and responsibilities, but with a shrinking budget and ever
                            growing Congressional limitations with which to carry them out.</p>
                        <p>You will see in this summary report that a number of worries and
                            concerns, repeatedly expressed, revolved around the problems of
                            diminishing U.S. resources, and the need to be very careful that our
                            reduced budget does not give our Asian friends the impression that our
                            assistance to them, and our deterrent capabilities, are going to be
                            eroded to the point where they cannot rely on us for essential help.</p>
                        <p>The Chiefs of Mission repeatedly emphasized in this connection that to
                            ease the transition in Asia as much as possible it was essential that we
                            formulate coherent strategic plans for the area. Such plans would make
                            anticipated base and force reductions in the Pacific more understandable
                            for all concerned, would provide a more rational basis for future budget
                            preparations and redeployments, and would be useful in our efforts to
                            obtain greater understanding and support for our plans in Congress. The
                            group agreed that the recommended planning was a sufficiently important
                            and difficult task to warrant your personal attention.</p>
                        <p><pb n="142" facs="0173" xml:id="pg_142"/>The Chiefs of Mission recognized
                            that our aim should be to draw back somewhat. But we should not draw
                            back too far or too fast lest we undermine Asian self-confidence which
                            has made possible the remarkable progress all the way from Korea down to
                            Indonesia. On the other hand, a drawing back and lessening of American
                            official presence will help spark the initiative of Asians, will spur
                            their do-it-yourself spirit, and will comport with their growing
                                nationalism.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2"><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                            of Asia, but we can and must support the good Asian problem solvers. As
                            you have pointed out, it is not a question of getting out of Asia but of
                            finding the right way and right degree of staying in Asia.<note n="3"

                                    contribution will increase more gradually and in less helpful
                                    forms than we would like . . . . We must give primacy to

                                Balance</p>
                            <p>The Sino-Soviet estrangement and the growing power of Japan have
                                produced a multipolar situation in East Asia replacing the
                                bipolarity of the Fifties and Sixties.</p>
                            <pb n="143" facs="0174" xml:id="pg_143"/>

                            <p>Of the four powers, Japan is the one whose international role will
                                expand the most in the next five years. While its political
                                influence has not kept pace with its economic growth, there are
                                signs that this is beginning to change as a result of the changing
                                national mood. Japan’s Djakarta Conference role is illustrative.</p>
                            <p>Heavily dependent on trade, Japan has a greater stake in regional
                                stability than the other three powers. The extent to which it will
                                use its enormous economic strength to promote regional economic
                                developments and stability is not yet clear. There are powerful
                                domestic demands on resources in Japan and continuing inhibitions
                                abroad and in Japan against a mounting Japanese presence.</p>
                            <p>Northeast Asia is in a relatively stable condition, but Indochina
                                creates many uncertainties for mainland Southeast Asia and for the
                                Japanese. The Japanese sympathize with our problems in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss> but are providing inadequate help.
                                We must work out a division of labor with Japan for our mutual goal
                                of a stable and developing East Asia. We cannot twist Japan’s arm as
                                much as before. Projects must commend themselves to the Japanese,
                                and preferably be of Japanese inspiration.</p>
                            <p>Eventually Japan should and will make an overseas security
                                contribution, but nothing substantial is considered likely in the
                                next five years. Its best contribution for an indeterminate period
                                will be economic. There is a good prospect that this will increase,
                                but more gradually and in less helpful forms than we would like.</p>

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">VI.</hi> Recommendations</p>
                            <p>The Conference endorsed the policies of 1969–70 dealing with the
                                Soviet Union, Communist China and Japan and with the major problems
                                of the area. These policies should be continued. However, great
                                concern was repeatedly expressed by the Ambassadors that the
                                material resources allocated in support of the Nixon Doctrine might
                                not be sufficient.</p>
                            <p>The Conference recommended the following actions:</p>
                            <p>A. <hi rend="italic">General</hi></p>
                            <p>1. The Nixon Doctrine is welcome in the area and sound, but the U.S.
                                must provide essential economic and military assistance so that the
                                free East Asian nations which are able and ready to practice
                                self-help can have the wherewithal and confidence to do so.</p>
                            <p><pb n="144" facs="0175" xml:id="pg_144"/>2. An overall strategic plan
                                for the area should be developed, matching U.S. military and
                                economic resources with U.S. goals.<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5"

                            <p>3. Programs to enhance American public and Congressional support for
                                such essential U.S. assistance in the period ahead should be
                                promoted as a matter of top priority.</p>
                            <p>4. Greater efforts should be made to show Asians that President

                            <p>5. While recognizing that the Congress clearly has the right to
                                investigate U.S.G. activities abroad and that it is desirable to
                                keep the U.S. public informed, we must take into account the fact
                                that several Asian states have reacted, and will continue to react
                                strongly to the publication of certain information considered to be
                                classified by those nations.</p>
                            <p>6. As we depend more on Asian initiatives and self-help, advance
                                consultation with our friends in the region on all key decisions
                                affecting their interests, including policy on Mainland China, will
                                be increasingly important. With Japan, this consultation will be
                                particularly crucial in influencing its regional role.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Japan</hi></p>
                            <p>1. The U.S. must recognize the primacy of close relations with Japan,
                                irrespective of the irritations and frictions that inevitably arise
                                in this relationship.</p>
                            <p>2. The U.S. should discreetly encourage an expanding Japanese
                                economic and political, ultimately also security, contribution in
                                the region. A substantially increased Japanese economic contribution

                                possibility that increasing impatience on this score may jeopardize
                                U.S.-Japan relations. Due care should at the same time be paid to
                                other countries’ sensitivities over an excessive Japanese

                        <p>It is clear that the <hi rend="italic">principal problem was the length
                                of the agreement, and that compromises on the other points had
                                either been reached or seemed attainable.</hi></p>
                        <p>On <hi rend="italic">timing,</hi> the Japanese were willing to agree to
                            restraints for twelve to eighteen months, provided the United States
                            would agree not to expand the time limit of the agreement or expand the
                            concept of voluntary restraints to other industries. The U.S. insisted
                            on an agreement lasting at least until 1973. The Japanese argued that
                            they could not accept the longer period without a justification beyond
                            the timing of U.S. elections.</p>

                                restrained, and one (largely fictitious) overall category for

                            <p>—The Japanese agreed that the United States could call for
                                consultations on non-sensitive (and thus <hi rend="italic"
                                    >non-restricted</hi>) <hi rend="italic">items</hi> whenever we
                                found imports disturbing. If no satisfactory solution resulted from
                                the consultations, the United States could unilaterally restrict
                                imports within 30 days and the Japanese would not press their
                                compensation rights in <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>—The Japanese wanted a <hi rend="italic">base year</hi> of calendar
                                1969 for synthetics and calendar 1968 for wool, the best year from
                                their standpoint for both. The U.S. wanted fiscal 1969 for both,
                                which would have been more restrictive on both. Compromise appeared
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>—On the <hi rend="italic">rate of growth,</hi> Japan wanted imports

                                whereas the U.S. preferred a more restrictive year-to-year

                        <p>On the purely diplomatic side, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"

                            November by you and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>
                            said he had questioned <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> on
                            this, and that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> said there
                            had been no explicit understanding on specifics—that he had simply
                            promised “to do his utmost” to reach satisfactory agreement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> claimed that his sole reason
                            for coming was to fulfill that promise—not to forestall the Mills bill,
                            nor to meet the demands of the U.S. textile industry. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> said that his coming should be
                            construed as representing the Prime Minister’s promise “to do his
                            utmost.”</p>

                        <p>When we approach the Japanese again on textile negotiations, the
                            situation will be very much influenced by the status of the Mills bill
                            and your position on it. However, part of the situation brought out in
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> conversation will remain the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to help re-start the negotiations, and help head off
                            restrictive U.S. legislation, <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            Director-General Long has personally offered an informal proposal which
                            meets our position on most counts—including duration. Our people are
                            assessing it in detail, as are the Japanese. If it looks acceptable to
                            us, we will see whether the Japanese are sufficiently interested to make
                            new talks worthwhile.</p>
                        <p>An agreement by mid-October with Japan, if one were possible, would put
                            you in the best possible position to veto the trade legislation which is
                            likely to reach your desk about that time—since your textile commitment
                            would have been taken care of by other means. We could also begin
                            negotiations shortly with Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan, to demonstrate
                            action and perhaps to make it easier for the Japanese to negotiate.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> spoke with you
                            last month about developments in Cambodia. It is a topic which deeply
                            and personally concerns me.</p>
                        <p>I believe that you share my conviction that the stability and prosperity
                            of Southeast Asia are of great importance to American and Japanese
                            interests, and to those of all the peoples of Asia. It was heartening to
                            learn that following an initial contribution by your Government of
                            emergency relief supplies to Cambodia, your country is intending to
                            improve transportation in Cambodia through the provision of $2,000,000
                            for trucks and other commodities. This improvement is very much needed.
                            Japan’s efforts to meet Cambodia’s urgent requirements are a most
                            significant beginning. Further steps will be essential.</p>
                        <p>It is my earnest hope that you will continue to be able to address
                            yourself personally to this problem. In my view, its importance
                            transcends the boundaries of one small and beleaguered Southeast Asian
                            nation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Defense is preparing to make an initial “token” shipment of chemical
                            weapons from Okinawa to Johnston Island in the Pacific around September
                            23. The remainder of the stocks would be shipped sometime in January of
                            1971, after necessary storage facilities have been constructed. The
                            September shipment would comprise a little over 1% of the 13,000 tons of
                            chemical weapons stored on Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>On June 8, 1970, recognizing our commitment to the Japanese and
                            Okinawans, I suggested to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                                >Laird</persName> that some shipments of chemical weapons from
                            Okinawa should begin as soon as feasible after the Surgeon General’s
                            recommendations are implemented and Congress notified as required by
                                law.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                        <p>On August 28, General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                            suggested to Defense that the situation had changed and it would be
                            preferable to delay shipment of chemical weapons from Okinawa until such
                            a move could be accomplished in a single operation early next year.<note

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName>, however, intends
                            to go ahead with the initial shipment and to notify Congress on
                            September 9 of this plan.</p>
                        <p>The principal arguments favoring a “token” shipment in September are:</p>
                        <p>—A shipment now would be a gesture of good faith regarding our intention
                            to move these weapons as we promised the Japanese and Okinawans.</p>
                        <p><pb n="149" facs="0180" xml:id="pg_149"/>—A “token” shipment would signal
                            to Congress our intention (a) to relocate these weapons to Johnston
                            Island but not to any of the 50 States and (b) to retain chemical
                            weapons in our stockpile.</p>
                        <p>—The shipment would demonstrate our ability to move these weapons safely
                            (overland on Okinawa and then by sea to Johnston Island).</p>
                        <p>—If this “token” shipment is uncontested by Congress, it could facilitate
                            authorization and funding for construction of storage facilities and for
                            the major shipments in January.</p>
                        <p>The main arguments against a September shipment are:</p>
                        <p>—Shipment in two parts (September and January) could stir up debate over
                            the necessity for these weapons and their storage on both occasions. A
                            “token” shipment now could highlight the issue once again in Japan,
                            Okinawa and the US before we are prepared to move the entire stock.</p>
                        <p>—The Gravel Amendment to the Foreign Military Sales Act is still in
                            conference after having passed the Senate (51 to 40). This Amendment
                            would (1) prohibit the shipment of these weapons from Okinawa to the US
                            and (2) authorize funds for the destruction of the weapons outside the
                            US. Senator Gravel has defined the term “US” in his Amendment to include
                            the 50 States and US possessions and territories, including Johnston
                            Island. The intent of the Amendment as it now stands is clearly to have
                            the weapons detoxified on site.</p>
                        <quote><p>We are now attempting to have the conference reinterpret the
                                Amendment to eliminate the restriction against shipment to
                                possessions and territories. A “token” shipment while this bill is
                                in conference could be considered discourteous to the Senate,
                                particularly by the 51 Senators who voted for the Amendment and who
                                would have ample time to build their case against the shipments
                                planned for January, thus diminishing our chances of having the
                                restriction reinterpreted.</p></quote>
                        <p>—An environmental impact statement has not been submitted to the Council
                            on Environmental Quality. Though technically not required for such
                            shipments, we should have the Council’s approval in hand before moving
                            ahead to reassure the public when the shipment is announced.</p>
                        <p>—The issue is relatively quiet in Japan and Okinawa. A “token” shipment
                            now could bring the issue to the fore and prompt questions as to when
                            the bulk of the weapons will be removed.</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be preferable to move all the weapons in a single
                            operation in January, rather than begin with a “token” shipment now. I
                            see no benefit in stirring up debate twice and highlighting the issue
                            once again in Japan, Okinawa and the US before we are prepared to move
                            the entire stock.</p>
                        <p><pb n="150" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_150"/>Movement in one operation will
                            avoid the problems associated with an “on again, off again” operation.
                            Moreover, this will give us time to get the Environmental Quality
                            Council’s approval. There is no significant difference in costs whether
                            there is a “token” shipment now or whether all the stocks are moved
                            later.</p>
                        <p>The proposed memorandum at Tab A directs that this “token” shipment not
                            be made but that the shipments take place when we are prepared to move
                            all the stockpile and the storage facilities are available.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. Both of them believed that there
                            was a national consensus in Japan on this issue, and that to go nuclear
                            would be to defy this national consensus and run counter to the Japanese
                            national interest. With respect to the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName>
                            believed that Japanese ratification would proceed smoothly if the
                            question of inspection could be settled on terms which were equal to the
                            other terms in the Treaty. He then stepped back somewhat, saying that
                            the ratification process might not go too smoothly, but would proceed.
                            There would be debate in the Diet, but ratification would finally
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>The second point touched on by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> was the U.S.-Japanese Security Treaty. He
                            expressed himself as firmly believing in maintaining the Treaty, which
                            had kept peace in the Pacific Ocean area, and also had kept world peace.
                            If there was a storm in the Pacific area, Asia would be in chaos, and
                            therefore it was vital for the peace of the world that the U.S. and
                            Japan maintain their ties through the Security Treaty. He went on to say
                            that a system of relationships based on the Security Treaty should be
                            maintained on a “semi-permanent basis.” The Security Treaty itself might
                            need to be reviewed periodically, but the fundamental relations between
                            the two countries would be maintained on a harmonious basis. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> said he felt,
                            though, that there was now a need to change the principles which had
                            been in effect for conducting the U.S.-Japanese Security Consultative
                            Committee. The U.S. has been represented on this Committee by its
                            Ambassador in Tokyo and by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC_1">CINCPAC</gloss>,
                            while Japan has been represented by its Defense Minister and Foreign
                            Minister. There has been a certain series of historical factors behind
                            this arrangement in Japan, and he had so far avoided putting the
                            spotlight on the membership question. He now thought, though, that
                            looking at things from the Japanese side the time had come for the
                            representatives on both sides to be Cabinet Ministers. If this could be
                            arranged, and if the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> could meet
                            periodically, it would serve as a psychological deterrent to the other
                            side.</p>

                            quite a bit, and that if he had come to the U.S. as Defense Minister two
                            years ago, there would have been demonstrations on his departure. (Dr.

                            observed that demonstrations might occur on his return, though.) As to
                            the change in the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> which he had
                            proposed, a year or two ago this would have been described by the press

                            this time when he had mentioned it to journalists, there had been no
                            reaction. Since the situation in Japan had become normalized, it was
                            high time that security matters be addressed at the Cabinet Minister
                            level.</p>

                                the origins of which are generally traced to a July 25, 1969,

                                responsibility for their own security. See <ref

                                    Policy, 1969–1972, Document 29</ref>.</note> and its
                            relationship to the U.S. bases in Japan. This Doctrine, he believed, was
                            reasonable for the U.S., but he had noticed a certain adverse reaction
                            to it in Korea and Taiwan. Accordingly, to reassure the Koreans and
                            Chinese, he had taken the initiative of sending some of his generals to
                            these countries to reassure them about the Nixon Doctrine. From the
                            Japanese point of view, it would be better to see the U.S. bases reduced
                            and amalgamated, or even for the Japanese self-defense forces to take
                            over control or management. What was needed for the security of the area
                            was reliance on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and the presence of the U.S.
                            7th Fleet. His government reserved the right to ask the U.S. to reenter
                            if needed, especially with respect to the U.S. Air Force. If these three
                            things were done—reduction of the U.S. military presence, maintenance of
                            the U.S. nuclear deterrent and the 7th Fleet, and Japanese preservation
                            of the reentry rights—the Japanese then could take over the defense of
                            their own islands. The U.S. possessed 122 bases, which was too much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            efforts in bringing about an agreement on the reversion of Okinawa to
                            Japan. When Okinawa reverts in 1972, Japan would face a “big job”: the
                            business of getting the bases back from the U.S., returning the land to
                            the original legal owners, getting contracts for this land in the hands
                            of the Japanese government, then leasing the bases back to the U.S. <pb
                                n="153" facs="0184" xml:id="pg_153"/>government. Opposition might be
                            expected from the original owners, who might refuse to sign contracts,
                            and in order to avoid this it might be better for the U.S. to give up
                            certain bases located among civilian areas.</p>
                        <p>The last point which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName>
                            wanted to bring up was the problem of nuclear enrichment technology.
                            Since Japan had renounced nuclear weapons and had held to a policy of
                            peaceful use of nuclear energy, enrichment technology was very important
                            for Japan and the U.S. should release some of this technology. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> had discussed this
                            in his conversations with others in Washington. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> replied that he had talked
                            over the matter with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that in principle he was sympathetic
                            with almost everything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> had said. There was no problem in our
                            consolidating bases, and we were doing something along such lines
                            anyway. As for regular meetings of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1"
                                >SCC</gloss>, he would explore this with his colleagues; Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName>’s proposals sounded
                            reasonable. With respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName>’s remarks on the U.S. nuclear enrichment
                            technology policy, we were in process of considering a new policy and
                            would make our decision within the next two weeks or so. In spirit,
                            everything which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> had
                            said was acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> alluded to the
                            possibility of Australia, Canada, U.S. and Japan working together in the
                            nuclear enrichment field in some sort of a consortium. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we were trying
                            to decide what part of our enrichment technology we would share in what
                            way. He wondered whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> was interested in gaseous centrifuge or gaseous
                            diffusion techniques. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> said that the Japanese had been working on
                            centrifuge technology and had been making fairly good progress; however,
                            this cost a great deal of money and caused suspicion among Asian
                            nations. Therefore, Japan would prefer access to gaseous diffusion
                            technology. (At this point the meeting broke up to permit photographs
                            and to allow Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> to proceed to
                            lunch.)</p>

                                Affairs Whitaker, considered the pros and cons of initial shipments
                                of chemical weapons in September. Behr and Whitaker’s argument
                                against such shipments was that 1) shipment in two parts might
                                arouse more controversy; 2) the Environmental Quality Council had
                                not yet submitted an environmental impact statement; 3) Congress was
                                considering a bill on the chemical weapon shipments, and taking
                                action while they were in conference “could be considered
                                discourteous;” 4) the issue was currently quiet in Japan and
                                Okinawa, and “an initial shipment could prompt questions of when the
                                remaining bulk of the weapons would be removed.” (Ibid.)</note></p>
                        <p>It would be preferable that the movement of the Okinawan stocks be
                            accomplished in a single operation when the necessary storage facilities
                            are available.</p>
                        <p>To allay any public concern, it would also be appropriate that an
                            environmental impact statement on the movement be reviewed by the
                            Council on Environmental Quality before the shipments begin.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, you should plan for these shipments sometime early in 1971.
                            I would appreciate your informing me of when the shipments will take
                            place.</p>

                        <p>After a lengthy discussion of textiles, initiated by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>, he expressed willingness to
                            see “what can be worked out.” This statement was not a commitment but
                            more of a side comment, but clear enough.</p>
                        <p>Earlier in the discussion there was considerable comment about the manner
                            of conducting negotiations. This has apparently been highly
                            unsatisfactory on both sides partly because there have been many
                            different negotiators. On this point <persName corresp="#p_MK_1"
                                >Miyazawa</persName> asked who he should communicate with if
                            something were worked out and the response by the Ambassador was to the
                            American Ambassador in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>It was clear that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>
                            is by this time in poor standing with the Japanese and probably cannot
                            take any further effective role in these negotiations. At the same time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> did not seem overly
                            impressed with the Ambassador’s evident desire to highly channeled
                            negotiating procedures. He referred to <persName corresp="#p_KDM_1">Don
                                Kendall</persName> and Rex Reed as old friends,<note n="2"

                                    Kendall</persName>, was the President and CEO of Pepsi-Cola, a
                                friend of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName>, and
                                the Chairman of the Emergency Committee for American Trade. No
                                participant in the textile issue by the name of Rex Reed has been
                                identified. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> may be
                                referring to Ralph Reid, who had served in the American occupation
                                of Japan, knew <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>, and
                                served as an intermediary between <persName corresp="#p_MK_1"
                                    >Miyazawa</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"

                            honesty and stated directly his resentment of the Ambassador’s
                            unfriendly comment about <persName corresp="#p_MK_1"
                            >Miyazawa</persName>’s discussion with these gentlemen. Perhaps more
                            than anything else, <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> is
                            concerned about the elusive piece of paper presumably representing an
                            agreement by the Prime Minister with the President.<note n="3"

                                summit, see <ref target="#d31">Documents 31</ref> and <ref
                                    target="#d35">35</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion about the rise of protectionism in the
                            United States and the way in which the textile negotiations played a
                            part in the development of the Mills bill. While concerned about
                            protectionism, <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> seemed
                            resigned to it and did not seem to think any action on textiles now
                            would have much impact. He referred to this as a swing of the pendulum
                            and could not see how this swing would be altered by any Japanese
                            actions. His stated motivation in trying to work out some agreement on
                            textiles was therefore <pb n="156" facs="0187" xml:id="pg_156"/>based
                            almost exclusively on the grounds of clearing up any ambiguity in the
                            point of honor of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p>If something is to be worked out in textiles, it may come through the
                            negotiations being promoted by Oliver Long.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4"

                                1979), pp. 189–191, for additional information.</note> The
                            Ambassador is pushing this approach. I would say this would not
                            necessarily be the case and is certainly not particularly <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>’s view.</p>
                        <p>Other points discussed during this long evening were the following:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> is organizing a
                            program (the machinery is about prepared) for controlling exports when
                            they rise above a 20% annual rate of growth. This proportion was
                            challenged as being on the high side, but whether it is or not depends
                            on the narrowness of the product category definitions.</p>
                        <p>2. He agrees that liberalization of trade and investment opportunities in
                            Japan is desirable but is absolutely opposed to alteration of the 50%
                            ceiling on foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>3. The question was raised about the uses of the rapidly building foreign
                            exchange surplus. Foreign aid is one obvious use but <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> emphasized industry arguments
                            in favor of use of these resources to acquire control of raw materials
                            abroad. This point was strongly confirmed during our discussion the next
                            evening with business leaders. Their explanation of rising productivity
                            in Japan rested in significant proportion on access to raw materials of
                            high quality. The importance of large ships was stressed.</p>
                        <p>4. Much of <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>’s conversation
                            carried an overtone of concern about Japan. Complimentary comments about
                            the work pace and drive we observed were met with the observation that
                            this drive causes deep resentment abroad perhaps to the point of hatred.
                            At the same time he notices a shift in attitude among youth away from
                            the nation-oriented “idealism” that characterized his younger days
                            toward a more inquisitive and materialistic set of attitudes.</p>
                        <p>5. He raised questions about the flexibility of rates of exchange among
                            currencies as a substitute for the more direct management of trade.
                            Apparently he has only limited access to discussions of this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>The impression we have is that the Japanese government has not
                            effectively organized the subjects of trade, monetary development and
                            aid so that they can be managed in a cohesive way.</p>

                                other record of that meeting has been found.</note> on the occasion
                            of the funeral of Former President Eisenhower, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> thanked the President for the
                            highly satisfactory decisions which had been reached on the reversion of
                            Okinawa, briefly commented that arrangements for reversion are
                            progressing smoothly, and expressed the hope that despite the existence
                            of a few remaining problems, the reversion negotiations would soon be
                            successfully concluded.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> then commented that
                            automatic extension of the Security Treaty had been accomplished
                            smoothly and with very little opposition on the part of the Japanese
                            people compared to 10 years ago, when the Red Chinese had stirred up the
                            sentiments of the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> then cited the textile
                            issue and the breakdown in negotiations as the foremost and the most
                            pressing problem in US/Japan relations. He acknowledged the existence of
                            other economic issues as well, but said he believed the relationship
                            between the two countries is basically friendly; it must be strengthened
                            still further, however, for the benefit of both nations. He continued
                            that to this end, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s Government and the Liberal Democratic Party are
                            making efforts to liberalize Japan’s trade restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Southeast Asian situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> commented that United States efforts to stabilize
                            the Vietnam area are meeting with success and that Japan is cooperating
                            in extending aid to that part of the world. He said Japan will also
                            cooperate in the implementation of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine but, expressing concern lest the US
                            withdraw its military power too rapidly from the area, stressed that in
                            the pursuit of this policy it is essential to time such withdrawals
                            properly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> said that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will be attending the
                            United Nations celebration on October 19 and in his speech will probably
                            mention the Japanese desire for the return of the Northern
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> said he was
                            pleased at being able to meet again with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName>. He expressed his respect for both Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, whom he considered world
                            statesmen, and his pleasure at being able to maintain close personal
                            relationships with them both. He said it is essential for the leaders of
                            the two major Pacific powers to continue this relationship. Touching
                            briefly on Okinawa, the President acknowledged that the final details of
                            the Okinawa reversion and other problems must be settled in a reasonable
                            manner.</p>
                        <p><pb n="159" facs="0190" xml:id="pg_159"/>In the economic area, the
                            President expressed his concern over the dangers of a trade war and said
                            he recognizes the difficulties in the textile situation. During the
                            Okinawa reversion negotiation last year, Congress had pressed him to
                            settle the Okinawa and textile matters in one package. He had assured
                            Congress, however, that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> would work out a solution to the textile problem.
                            The President stated that he is in a rather embarrassing position now
                            since the textile negotiations have broken down. He emphasized, however,
                            the importance of solving the Okinawa and textile problems
                            independently. He stressed the desirable effects which settlement of the
                            textile problem on a voluntary basis will have in stopping the spread of
                            protectionist sentiment in Congress. After citing electronics as another
                            possible target, the President emphasized again that a voluntary
                            settlement of the textile problem will certainly help his position. He
                            said he would not wish to bring up the matter of textile negotiations
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> at their
                            forthcoming meeting unless there was a good possibility of negotiations
                            leading to a settlement of mutual benefit for both nations.</p>
                        <p>The President then addressed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s concern that the implementation of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine might result in an
                            overly rapid withdrawal of the US presence from the Asian area. He
                            assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> that there will
                            be no complete withdrawal of US forces from either Europe or Asia
                            without their replacement by elements of strength capable of deterring
                            aggression. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> recalled
                            that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> had both
                            opposed aggression in Asia from the time when he was Vice President and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> was a minister not yet
                            in power. He strongly reiterated that free nations of the world must
                            maintain sufficient strength to deter aggression. Many Americans are now
                            demanding immediate withdrawal, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> said that as long as he is in office he will
                            maintain enough strength to insure the free nations against
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>The President then emphasized to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> that it is essential that Japan and the United
                            States continue their close relationship, working together for their
                            mutual benefit.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> for his appraisal of
                            present developments in Communist China and what policies the US and
                            Japan should maintain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            emphatically stated that the present US policy need not change as long
                            as Communist China does not change its attitude on coexistence. He said
                            that Japan has also had difficulties with Communist China’s policy. The
                            former Japanese Prime Minister added that Taiwan must be considered
                            before the two nations change their policies towards Communist China;
                            Nationalist China has been a member of the United Nations ever since its
                            beginning and it would be a mistake to alter the present policy at this
                            time. He also pointed out Taiwan’s strategic position as regards defense
                            and security of Asia.</p>
                        <p><pb n="160" facs="0191" xml:id="pg_160"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>, after commenting that we must not turn against
                            our friends now, asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> thought the Soviet Union and Communist China will
                            get together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> answered
                            that although there is no immediate possibility of this, the two
                            countries will eventually join hands. He stated that this possibility
                            cannot be ruled out.</p>

                            would take <pb n="163" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_163"/>care to ensure that
                            none became serious. He asked for the President’s comments on the
                            Okinawa reversion negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had told our people to cooperate in working
                            out little problems in the same way that he and the Prime Minister had
                            cooperated in solving the big problem.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> (in response to the
                            President) said that the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> relay
                            station and civil aviation seemed to present the only major problems at
                            the moment. We were pressing to resolve all detailed aspects of
                            reversion by next summer, in order to present an agreement to the
                            Congress and the Diet for the necessary legislative approval well enough
                            in advance to ensure meeting the target date for reversion.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, the Prime
                            Minister noted certain technical problems which required time for
                            resolution. Meanwhile, Japan would not move quickly to halt the function
                            of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. However, there were
                            anti-war and communistic elements in Okinawa. Naturally time was needed
                            to deal with this matter, as well as the question of gradual American
                            troop withdrawals. How to deal with these matters and at the same time
                            take into account the views of the local people was the major
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained to the
                            President that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and civil aviation
                            had not been raised to his level because it was hoped that a solution
                            would be worked out at lower levels.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Korea</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister raised an unrelated matter, the recent transfer of an
                            American F–4 unit to the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> Ambassador in Tokyo had told
                            him that the Koreans welcomed this unit with warm gratitude, since they
                            were not as deeply concerned about the American military presence as the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the F–4 transfer was a good move. He added that
                            improved Japan-<gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> relations on a more
                            friendly basis were most helpful.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister welcomed both the Middle East Truce and the FRG–<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Treaty because they reduced world
                            tensions. However, he added, Japan could not accept the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> position which advocated the
                            “freezing” of post World War II boundaries. The Soviet press has
                            strongly criticised Japan’s position on the Northern Territories (<hi
                                rend="italic">Note:</hi> the islands of Habomai and Shikotan, and
                            the two southernmost Kurile islands, Kunashiri and Etorofu). While Japan
                            welcomed these developments as reductions of tensions, and hence the
                            possibility of war, nevertheless, he stressed that it could not agree to
                            a territorial “freeze” along the lines of the status quo.</p>
                        <p><pb n="164" facs="0195" xml:id="pg_164"/>The President noted that the
                            Soviets considered that everything on their side was “frozen,” but not
                            on our side.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled his response on this point to the lady
                            Minister of Culture of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in
                            Tokyo shortly after the FRG–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            Treaty was announced. He told her that he welcomed the Treaty since it
                            reduced the possibility of war, but also pointed out that it failed to
                            confirm national boundaries adequately. He also recalled telling Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> that something
                            must be done about this, particularly with respect to the status of
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President, to clarify our position, said that we had never urged the
                            FRG to make this Treaty with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                            That action was taken entirely at the initiative of the FRG. Up to now
                            all the advantage has been on the Soviet side, with none for the
                            government of the FRG. It was vital, he stressed, to secure new
                            arrangements which would assure the viability of Berlin, and the
                            viability continuation of its economic and political ties with West
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> explained that the United States has never
                            taken the position that the Northern Territories were Soviet
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Soviets follow a double-standard. They
                            demanded that the United States return Okinawa to Japan, but refused to
                            discuss the Northern Territories.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> occupied the Northern Territories one month after the
                            end of the war. There had been no combat there at all. To correct any
                            possible misunderstanding, he said that these islands had always been an
                            integral part of Japanese territory for ages past; they had never
                            belonged to any other nation including the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Even the oldest maps of Imperial Tsarist Russia
                            showed Etorofu and Kunashiri as Japanese islands. Had the Russians
                            succeeded in their desire to occupy Hokkaido after the surrender, he did
                            not doubt that they would still be there, and that Japan would be a
                            divided state, like Korea. General Eisenhower and Ambassador Harriman,
                            fortunately, had effectively prevented the Soviets from doing so at that
                            time, and Generalissimo <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> then took the strong position that only the
                            United States and China had any right to occupy Japan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">4.</hi> China</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that Canadian recognition and possible Italian
                            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> complicated the
                            China question. However, the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> felt a
                            deep sense of obligation to <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> in view of his past good will for Japan. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> intended firmly to maintain its
                            present position with respect to the government on Taiwan, and in the
                            forthcoming vote on Chinese representation at the <gloss

                        <p>The President was pleased to hear this, because we also intended to
                            maintain our same position. In the long run it would be desirable <pb
                                n="165" facs="0196" xml:id="pg_165"/>to normalize relations with
                            Mainland China, as he had indicated to the Prime Minister last November,
                            but now was [<hi rend="italic">not</hi>] the time to do so. What was
                            needed now was firmness.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister reviewed his discussion with Prime Minister <persName

                            However, as expected, Hanoi had not responded favorably. Even so, it was
                            good to continue to appeal in this way to the American people as well as
                            to the people of the world.</p>
                        <p>Although Japan could not assist militarily, the Prime Minister said that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> intended to increase its
                            economic assistance to Indo-China, thereby to further the stabilization
                            which was also the goal of the United States Vietnamization program. To
                            explore possible avenues for increased assistance, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> had recently dispatched a study team
                            to the area. He cautioned that not much could be expected of Japan in
                            terms of amounts of money, but added that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> wished to do all it possibly could.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed appreciation for the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> statement on his recent peace initiative. He too was
                            not surprised by the North Vietnamese rejection, but said that he would
                            continue to press for real negotiations. If the North Vietnamese
                            refused, the United States was prepared to continue the Vietnamization
                            program, and would remain vigilant against any North Vietnamese attempt
                            to take unfair advantage of our troop withdrawals. North Viet-Nam could
                            decide to negotiate now, or would have to accept the eventual need to
                            negotiate, not with the United States, but with a stronger South
                            Viet-Nam which had developed sufficiently to defend itself against being
                            overcome.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that Japan would play a more active economic role in
                            South Viet-Nam, and in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, because the
                            survival of non-communist governments there was in the best economic
                            interests of all the nations in the Pacific. We could trade <pb n="166"
                                facs="0197" xml:id="pg_166"/>with such governments, but there was
                            little trade with communist nations anywhere.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the United States carried two major burdens,
                            Viet-Nam and the Middle East. He expressed full appreciation for the
                            great efforts by the United States to bring about the present truce in
                            the Middle East. With its continuation, and the President’s October 7
                            initiative on Viet-Nam, he hoped that the sense of burden felt by the
                            American people would be lightened. These two developments, he trusted,
                            would serve to reassure the American people, and give them grounds for
                            hope.</p>
                        <p>In his meeting with Mrs. Meir in New York, the Prime Minister said that
                            he had urged her to persevere in the present situation without resorting
                            to war, even though the Arabs were violating the Truce.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the situation in the Middle East was very
                            difficult because no one trusted anyone else. We would continue to work
                            for peace and expected the Truce to continue, but an agreement would
                            take time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he also told Mrs. Meir that the continued
                            closure of the Suez Canal represented a great economic loss to the
                            world, because it cut off a route between the Far East and Western
                            Europe. In addition to urging her not to reopen hostilities, he also
                            tried to persuade her of the need to reopen the Suez Canal. When she
                            argued that the UAR did not allow Israeli ships to transit the Canal, he
                            responded that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> would support
                            any international move to reopen the Canal under a form of international
                            supervision which would permit the passage of Israeli shipping.</p>

                            of the great world-wide impact of Japan’s economic relations with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that Japan has enjoyed a very favorable balance
                            of trade with the United States over the past few years but imports from
                            the United States have increased this year, including agricultural
                            imports, thereby reducing the recent imbalance in our trade. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> now supported accelerated trade and
                            capital liberalization, as befitted the third nation in the world in
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>. The criticism of Japan’s
                            inadequate and slow liberalization was general, and there were strong
                            international pressures on Japan to accelerate its program. Recently
                            when the working level sent up an accelerated liberalization <pb n="167"
                                facs="0198" xml:id="pg_167"/>program which he thought was too slow,
                            the Prime Minister sent it back with instructions to really provide for
                            accelerated liberalization. Perhaps it was still too early to feel the
                            impact of recent <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> decisions, but he
                            assured the President that he was now implementing a broad and
                            accelerated trade and capital liberalization program.</p>

                            been reached, he reaffirmed his own determination to bring to a fruitful
                            conclusion the negotiations which have been resumed. Last year he had
                            promised the President to do something to resolve the textile issue, and
                            felt that he must apologize for embarrassing him by not doing what was
                            expected. On returning to Japan from their meeting last year, he had
                            been attacked frequently in the Diet for having made a “secret deal”
                            with the President. In response to each such attack, he explained that
                            he had told the President that it was not in the interest of either
                            country to leave the issue unresolved to grow as a basis for distrust
                            and that it must therefore be resolved, although he did not understand
                            the substance involved in an agreement. Therefore, he concluded his
                            responses to these attacks by saying there was no need for him to have
                            made a “secret deal” with the President.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expected to reach a solution in June when he sent the
                            Foreign Minister and the Minister of International Trade and Industry to
                            Washington to negotiate and was disappointed when agreement was not
                            reached. He did not know the reason for this failure.<note n="6"

                        <p>The President said that the Prime Minister knew the difficult problem
                            this was for him, because of his political commitment during the
                            campaign. It was also a difficult problem in the Congress, where
                            pressures were mounting in support of import quota legislation. However,
                            there was little he could add now to what he told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> recently.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d58fn7">See <ref target="#d56">Document 56</ref>.</note> As
                            of now, the problem has been given to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to work on. He could only say again, as
                            before, that failure to reach agreement could only open the floodgates
                            for many <pb n="168" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_168"/>other things. He
                            wished to leave textiles to the negotiators, and saw no use of further
                            discussions of them in this meeting.</p>
                        <p>The President also noted that while the Prime Minister had been
                            criticised in his Diet for having made a “secret agreement,” he had been
                            criticised in our Congress for not having made one, for having made a
                            promise on Okinawa without any progress on textiles. However, it was
                            best to let the matter rest there, in the hands of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. He did stress that this was
                            still a vital problem.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the pressures of time required an early
                            agreement. He recalled saying at the time of their Okinawa discussions
                            that he would do all that he could “within the limits of his assessments
                            of the future.” At that time he had no assessment of how things would
                            develop, but now time was pressing, and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>, who understood both the
                            situation and the time limit well, was actively engaged in discussions
                            with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>. The Prime Minister
                            promised to bring about an agreement once certain specific details were
                            resolved through mutual concessions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> informed the
                            President that November 10 was the goal in the talks with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>. The President noted
                            that this was after the election.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister (who understood this brief exchange in English) said
                            that the specific details would be settled by Election Day; he must
                            settle them on his return to Japan. The most important point was
                            categories, and on return to Tokyo the Prime Minister said that he would
                            have <gloss target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> explain them. No doubt,
                                <gloss target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName> would also put forth his
                            own point of view, but in the end the Prime Minister recognized that he
                            had to make the decision. He requested that the President permit him to
                            take whatever intervening steps he thought would be necessary to reach a
                            final decision in time. Further, he hoped that none of this would leak
                            to the press, at least to the extent that we could control it.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that we would
                            keep to the present channel and would keep this from the press.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the experts would have to be consulted when
                            the specifics were taken up, and warned against possible leaks then.
                            Even if there were none, the press was sharp and would write speculative
                            articles, some of which would be wrong, but some which might coincide
                            with fact. Should that happen he hoped that the American side would not
                            assume that there had been a leak. He hoped also that neither industry
                            be allowed to get overly upset about the speculative reporting which was
                            bound to come. If this could be done, a fine agreement could be
                            reached.</p>
                        <p><pb n="169" facs="0200" xml:id="pg_169"/>The President said that we would
                            do our best.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was pleased to hear this. For his own
                            part, he recognized that the time had come for him to make the decision.
                            He trusted that the President understood his position. He added that
                            once Japan and the United States reached agreement, international
                            confirmation of it by the other textile exporting nations would be
                            necessary. The United States would have to move fast to convince them to
                            accept it within the time limit. He said that Japan and the United
                            States would have to reach agreement by November 3, and in the two weeks
                            remaining after the mid-term elections and before the new Congress would
                            meet and resume hearings on the Mills Bill, the United States would have
                            to gain acceptance of the agreement by the other textile exporters. He
                            again expressed his concern about a leak, and said that he would
                            hand-carry what he had back to Tokyo rather than risk a leak through a
                            telegram. He said that he fully intended to persuade <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Miyazawa</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we would say nothing on this side.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that the greatest problem has been the
                            opposition of the textile industry in Japan to an agreement. Japan’s
                            major concession at this new stage resulted from getting it to drop its
                            demands for proof of injury before agreeing to voluntary
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName> would continue their talks. While the question
                            of separate categories was very difficult for him to understand, woolens
                            seemed to be no problem, and agreement there could be reached easily.
                            However, manmades would be a problem, and Japan would have to have some
                            concession from the United States with respect to the percentage of the
                            reductions.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he couldn’t go into this.<note n="8"

                        <p>The Prime Minister, referring to the recent visit of Mr. Train (Chairman
                            of the President’s Council for Environmental Quality), said that <pb
                                n="170" facs="0201" xml:id="pg_170"/>it had been agreed in Tokyo
                            that regular meetings be held at the Cabinet level to consider
                            environmental matters. He requested that the President consider how best
                            to provide for such an opportunity, and noted <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> willingness to send a Minister to the United States to
                            discuss environmental matters in response to an invitation. Mr. Train
                            could doubtless report fully to the President the serious public
                            concerns about environmental pollution in Japan, which has prompted the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> to revise its former slogan—No
                            welfare without economic growth—to “No economic growth without
                            welfare.”</p>

                            on Trade and Economic Affairs</p>
                        <p>In view of the economic problems between both countries, the Prime
                            Minister felt that it would be advisable to hold a regular meeting of
                            the Japan-United States Joint Cabinet Committee on Trade and Economic
                            Affairs in the United States next year, since it would be the United
                            States’ turn to serve as host. There would be no obstacle to prevent the
                            attendance of the Japanese Cabinet Ministers responsible for economic
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>The President said this was an excellent idea.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that this
                            meeting was set for next year.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that it was essential for the United States and
                            Japan to continue cooperating closely, particularly in view of the
                            economic problems between us which could affect the relationship.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">11.</hi> Hot-Line</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that the installation of the hot-line, which
                            had been discussed in November, was now under study within the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>. An unfortunate misunderstanding that
                            some sort of new crisis was impending could result if it were installed
                            without proper public affairs handling in advance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">12.</hi> Parting Exchange</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was glad to have had this good talk. He wished
                            to keep in close contact because, with Japan’s preeminent economic
                            position, both nations were bound to have many common interests, and
                            understandably some competition, which should be kept constructive. He
                            promised to keep the Prime Minister informed of any significant
                            international moves he would take concerning not only United
                            States-Japan relations but also the world at large. One thing gave him
                            hope. During his 1953 visit to Japan the sole subject of discussion had
                            been United States-Japan relations, but today, in this talk as before,
                            he and the Prime Minister had discussed the Middle East, Viet-Nam and
                            Europe as well as Japan, all of which told us that Japan is not only a
                            great power in the Pacific, but also a major world power with great
                            influence. We recognize this, and therefore, consider that <pb n="171"
                                facs="0202" xml:id="pg_171"/>close relations between us are
                            essential, not only for future peace and progress in the Pacific but
                            also throughout the world. He assured the Prime Minister that Japan
                            would always have a good friend in office as long as he was
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed appreciation for this. He noted that he and
                            John D. Rockefeller, III, had agreed in New York last week that the
                            bonds of familial love continue to hold parents and child together,
                            despite their differences. This applied also to nations. He did not want
                            the people of Japan to forget their deep obligation to the United States
                            for helping them recover from the destruction of the defeat in World War
                            II. Honoring one’s obligations was a traditional Japanese virtue which
                            the Japanese should not forget. Even the current economic problems
                            between both countries should be viewed in this context just as a child
                            should be grateful to his parents for helping to raise him.</p>

                        <p>Our semi-annual planning talks with the Japanese were held November 2–3.
                            The Japanese delegation was headed by Takashi Suzuki, Director General
                            of the Research and Analysis Department of the Japanese Foreign
                            Ministry. <persName corresp="#p_CWI_1">William I. Cargo</persName>,
                            Director of State Policy Planning and Coordination Staff headed the U.S.
                            delegation; Herbert Levin of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                            Staff attended most sessions. Following are highlights of the talks:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Nixon Doctrine:</hi> The Japanese expressed concern
                            that if the Nixon Doctrine results in too rapid withdrawal of U.S.
                            forces from Asia, the resolution of weaker non-Communist countries to
                            cope with Communist power and influence will be insufficient. The
                            Americans stressed that the Nixon Doctrine emphasized strengthening
                            indigenous <pb n="172" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_172"/>forces and that U.S.
                            withdrawals were taking place cautiously as local strength
                            developed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Japanese Role in Asia:</hi> The Japanese took great
                            pains to make clear that the U.S. should not anticipate Japan playing a
                            military role in Asia, for which Japan was unprepared. The Japanese
                            reflected extreme sensitivity to public comments predicting a resurgence
                            of Japanese militarism. The Japanese stated that we could anticipate
                            substantially larger Japanese economic assistance extended to Asia over
                            the next five years.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">China:</hi> The Japanese concern toward China as a
                            diplomatic problem, not as a military threat, was evident throughout the
                            talks. The Japanese attached special urgency to the need for early
                            U.S.-Japan agreement on a U.N. strategy in order to safeguard the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss>’s right to remain in the world
                            organization as a majority of its members move closer to favoring
                            Peking’s entry. The Japanese also wish to reach agreement with us as to
                            how to handle the bi-lateral relations aspect of the China problem as
                            the 1972 reversion of Okinawa nears and provides them with a common sea
                            border with Taiwan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Indochina:</hi> The Japanese showed little interest in
                            discussing the current situation in Indochina. They noted improvements
                            in both Vietnam and Cambodia, as evidenced by their increased
                            willingness to provide economic assistance to these countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Korean Troop Withdrawal:</hi> The Japanese expressed
                            interest in U.S. troop withdrawals from Korea, but did not manifest the
                            same concern on this topic as was apparent early last summer.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Environment:</hi> The Japanese want international
                            cooperation in this area. However, they wish to avoid attempts to impose
                            international standards and solutions on what their rather isolated
                            island situation suggests are national problems, particularly if they
                            affect trade.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Indian Ocean:</hi> The Japanese remain concerned over
                            any suggestion that the Soviets could achieve a position of naval
                            dominance in the Indian Ocean. The security of the Indian Ocean will be
                            a topic on the agenda for the next Planning Talks, in six months.</p>

                                would be mixed: the firings of Japanese employees in rural areas
                                would have negative effects, whereas the reduced number of bases
                                would lessen the frictions produced by U.S. military involvement in
                                Japan. (Ibid.)</note></head>

                        <p>On November 19, 1970, we authorized Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAH_1">Meyer</persName> to begin discussions with the
                            Government of Japan regarding the substantial reductions in U.S.
                            military operations in Japan scheduled to take place by June 30,
                            1971.</p>
                        <p>The package includes a reduction of approximately 9,000 Japanese
                            employees and some 10,000 U.S. service personnel. The major U.S. naval

                            aircraft repair facility. Itazuke Air Base will be returned to Japan,
                            except for a small area necessary to provide logistic support for other
                            U.S. operations at nearby bases.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has been instructed to seek reentry rights to some of the
                            relinquished facilities and joint use rights at others, the final
                            details of which have yet to be worked out. He is establishing a
                            committee in Tokyo consisting of Embassy, U.S. Forces, Japan, Foreign
                            Ministry and Defense Agency representatives, to work out the details of
                            the program.</p>
                        <p>The reductions will work hardship on many of the Japanese employees,
                            especially those in out-lying areas, and the Japanese enemies of our
                            security relationship will attempt to exploit them as evidence of a
                            weakening of our ability and intention to live up to our commitment.
                            However, our tactical Air Force and Seventh Fleet units will continue to
                            be present in Northeast Asia, concentrated in the East <pb n="174"

                            provide clear and continuing assurance to our allies while allowing us

                            presented an outline of the foregoing to the Foreign Minister. The

                            to study the package carefully. We intend to work closely with the
                            Japanese Government on all aspects of base reductions to assure both
                            that the reductions will be carried out in a coordinated fashion and
                            that the public understand that this is the case.</p>

                        <p>It now appears highly unlikely that we will get a Trade Bill in this
                            session of Congress. Time is simply too short, given the widespread
                            opposition to the measure and the complicated parliamentary situation.
                            This was the near-unanimous sentiment at the Republican leadership
                            meeting on Tuesday morning, and Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM_1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> and others echoed it to David Rockefeller
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>As you well know, I regard this as a positive result <hi rend="italic">in
                                the short run.</hi> However, it means that our leverage on the
                            Japanese to reach a textile agreement will be sharply reduced—perhaps to
                            the vanishing point—and thus set off longer-term developments which may
                            well be even worse than passage of the Mills bill this year.</p>
                        <p>I regard this as true despite <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                            >Sato</persName>’s commitment to the President. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has now stated publicly that he
                            will not invoke legislation to implement export controls. He therefore
                            must rely on the acquiescence <pb n="175" facs="0206" xml:id="pg_175"
                            />of his textile industry to implement any agreement he would negotiate
                            with us. We might reasonably expect his industry to agree to voluntary
                            restraints, however reluctantly, if its alternative was to face U.S.
                            quotas under the Mills bill. It could hardly be expected to acquiesce at
                            all if the alternative were no controls at all, at least for many more
                            months.</p>
                        <p>It thus seems that our leverage is running out, at least for the moment.
                            It erodes further every day, as Congressional adjournment without action
                            nears.</p>
                        <p>But the problem thus raised goes far beyond textiles. If we fail to reach
                            a negotiated agreement now, and the general consensus that there will be
                            no legislation proves correct, there will be three extremely bad
                            results.</p>
                        <p>First, the President’s commitment will remain unmet. Second, the textile
                            issue will continue to overhang overall U.S. trade policy—preventing any
                            positive steps, encouraging protectionism in the rest of the world, and
                            perhaps triggering even worse legislation than the Mills bill in 1971 or
                            1972 with even more serious effects on our foreign policy. Third, our
                            relations with Japan will continue to be eroded by off-and-on efforts to
                            negotiate on textiles and other products—not to mention the
                            recriminations over their bad faith in not carrying out their
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>I therefore regard it as urgent that we use the remaining leverage of the
                            pending legislation to reach a negotiated textile agreement—<hi
                                rend="italic">even if that agreement is far short of what we
                                want.</hi> I have every bit as negative a reaction to the Japanese
                            performance on this issue as you do—perhaps even more, since I have been
                            burdened with sitting through the thirteen <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            meetings and the interminable preparations for them.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I feel that we must now try to make the best of a very bad
                            situation—and it must of course always be remembered that it is we who
                            are asking for a monumental favor from the other fellow. I therefore
                            recommend that you urge <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>
                            to move quickly to reach an agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2"

                                a deal.”</note></p>
                        <p>In fact, the Japanese have now come far enough that an agreement based
                            almost entirely on their present offer could be readily defended to our
                            industry. It would certainly suffice to definitively turn off the Mills
                            bill, and to deter any new legislative efforts to vote textile quotas in
                            the future. It would therefore remove the major problem in our policy
                            toward Japan, which will otherwise become increasingly worse, and remove
                            the key factor which has turned U.S. trade policy into a potential
                            source of major rift with Western Europe.</p>

                        <p>I have had a report<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Not found.</note> on your
                            conversation yesterday with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>. I understand a question was raised about the
                            possibility of a “private understanding” on an intra-group trigger
                            mechanism.</p>
                        <p>I feel very strongly that it would be inappropriate to have any of the
                            following types of understandings with the Japanese:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. oral agreements;</p>
                            <p>2. any unilateral statement by us, not agreed to by the Japanese;
                                or</p>
                            <p>3. any side agreements not released to the public.</p></quote>
                        <p>Although unpublished understandings are used from time to time in
                            international relations, I do not believe such understandings should be
                            used in the type of business negotiations in which we are involved with
                            the Japanese. My concerns are along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. Any statement in the published agreement that Japan reserves its
                            rights under <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>, coupled with a
                            private understanding whereby the Japanese say to us that they do not
                            intend to use these rights, cannot be counted on as a binding commitment
                            on the Japanese Government even during the tenure of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> in Washington or Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p><pb n="177" facs="0208" xml:id="pg_177"/>2. If the Japanese are silent
                            with regard to their <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> rights, both
                            in the published agreement and in the private understanding, unless a
                            written document says that the Japanese agree to our intra-group trigger
                            mechanism, their <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> rights will be
                            fully reserved even without any reference to these rights in the
                            documents. We would have no protection in the agreement against Japanese
                            invocation of the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. A private understanding, either oral or written, must be made
                            available to <gloss target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss> because that is the
                            Ministry which will administer Japan’s controls on exports to us. Once
                            it is made available to <gloss target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss>
                            officials, it is a certainty that it will be made available to the
                            Japanese textile industry. If it is not made available to <gloss
                                target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss>, the people who will administer the
                            agreement will not know the parameters under which they will have to
                            operate, and exports of individual categories can be expected to exceed
                            the trigger levels.</p>
                        <p>4. If the agreement on the intra-group trigger mechanism is not made
                            public, we will have difficulties in negotiating effective controls with
                            other governments which inevitably will want to follow the same pattern
                            as the Japanese agreement. We would then need to establish the fact of
                            the intra-group trigger and of the understandings about <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> rights.</p>
                        <p>Thus I reach the inescapable conclusion that there is no effective
                            agreement involving our right to control imports of any category
                            exceeding the 3 percent limit unless it is written and in the form of
                            acceptance by the Japanese of such rights. Whether or not this agreement
                            is included in the basic agreement with the Japanese is immaterial. What
                            is essential is that it be released to the public, both in the United
                            States and in Japan.</p>

                                weapons following the construction of chemical weapon storage

                        <p>I am increasingly concerned that the protracted negotiations with Japan
                            over textiles are weakening the U.S.-Japan relationship, giving impetus
                            to unwholesome aspects of Japanese nationalism, and affecting the
                            stability of the Sato Government. While I share your exasperation with
                            the poor political handling of this problem in Japan, it would clearly
                            be inimical to our interest if this dispute were to weaken the influence
                            of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to the
                            point where he would be unable to determine his successor. I thus
                            believe there are important foreign policy considerations for achieving
                            a compromise solution as soon as possible.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>In a pair of telegrams perpetrated during the holiday season, we have
                            tried to assess how we did vis-à-vis the US-Japan relationship in 1970
                            and what we propose to do in 1971 (Tokyo 10460 and 94).<note n="2"

                            peruse at least the summaries.</p>
                        <p>One loose end is the textile problem. Well remembering that session in
                            your office following <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s chat
                            with our mutual boss, I am no less chagrined than others that the
                            promised solution has not been achieved. And I am among those who feel
                            that leadership here was not adequately exercised. Nonetheless, the fact
                            remains that this one unworthy issue could conceivably condemn <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to the same fate which befell his
                            brother ten years ago, i.e. a rather ignominious ouster precipitated by
                            a basic and rather childlike affection for the United States. Thus it
                            remains my hope that Pete and <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> may still be able to come up with some sort of
                            compromise. In all honesty, and as a great friend and admirer of Don
                            McCullough, Roger Milliken and other fine Carolinian textilists, I do
                            believe a little more give on our part is warranted. For their part, the
                            Japanese have come a considerable distance since they greeted Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName> in May 1969 with a
                            unanimous Diet resolution foreclosing any restraint program
                            whatsoever.</p>
                        <p><pb n="181" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_181"/>The other loose end is a
                            top-level visit to which we referred in a rather elliptic fashion in the
                            second telegram. It remains my dream to have a successful Presidential
                            visit to Japan. It could dispel much of the cantankerousness which
                            afflicts some of the dialogue between our two countries. But this is a
                            card which must be played most judiciously.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, we must first finish with all the threshing around over
                            textiles. Assuming that that happy day will yet arrive, it would seem to
                            me that if <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s party wins in
                            the Upper House elections in June (which is likely but let’s keep our
                            fingers crossed), and if <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Dick
                                Sneider</persName> and I can hard bargain solutions to the
                            prerequisite Okinawa reversion problems, i.e. a continuation which will
                            be defensible on Capitol Hill for our business, civil aviation and
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> interests in Okinawa, a
                            Presidential visit to Tokyo might be possible this fall. In so saying, I
                            realize I go out on a limb, but let us set that as a goal.</p>
                        <p>It was fascinating that Japan and our problems here were not even touched
                            upon in that fine hour-long Presidential chat on TV.<note n="3"

                            line of Kathleen Winsor’s that there is no indignity so infuriating for
                            a woman than not wanting to be slept with.<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4"

                                made into a 1947 movie of the same name.</note> “Forever Amber”
                            notwithstanding (or reclining), I am confident that the President and
                            his Chief National Security Advisor have in their thinking not
                            diminished by an iota their appreciation for our getting along with the
                            East Asian colossus to which I am assigned.</p>
                        <p>Let me assure you we are more convinced than ever of the President’s
                            wisdom re the paramountcy of our relationship with Japan. No challenge
                            could be greater, and all of us here are actively dedicated to coping
                            with it.</p>
                        <p>By the way, we have been delighted with your adroit and professorial
                            treatment of the “militarism” specter in Japan. You will not have any
                            difficulty in getting a visa should you decide to journey this way.</p>

                        <p>Negotiations designed to persuade the Japanese to impose restrictions on
                            their exports to the United States of man-made and woolen textiles have
                            dragged on for almost two years. They were broken off last summer but
                            resumed again following Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s conversation with the President in late October.
                            At that time the President designated <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Peter
                                Flanigan</persName> to negotiate for us and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> was designated to represent the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In mid-December <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> were close to an
                            agreement on restraints which would have covered about one-half of the
                            items involved in this trade, including all of the most sensitive ones.
                            When Congress adjourned, however, without completing action on the Mills
                            Bill, negotiations were again recessed. In January, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> gave <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> a new proposal which was
                            generally satisfactory except for a new provision which <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> described as essential. This
                            provision called for the automatic imposition of restraints on any
                            category in which imports from Japan increased by 10 percent or more,
                            regardless of any showing of injury and regardless of whether or not the
                            American industry was in fact a major producer of the item involved.
                            This re-introduced the element of comprehensiveness on which the
                            negotiators have never previously been able to agree.</p>

                            trigger arrangement that it did not dare, for fear of leaks and a public
                            outcry, to show the proposal to the Japanese Minister of International

                            now received instructions to inform <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName> that this proposal is not acceptable. It
                            appears therefore that these negotiations have again reached a point of
                            impasse. While both sides have held knowledge of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>’s latest proposal very closely
                            to date, the fact that a proposal was made and that the Japanese have
                            turned it down must eventually become public knowledge. When this
                            occurs, the minimum result will be another outburst of recriminations on
                            both sides. <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> has told
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Phil Trezise</persName> that he now
                            believes that the Administration should introduce and try to get enacted
                            quickly the textile section of the Mills Bill.</p>
                        <p>We continue to believe that a settlement through negotiations is the best
                            course. However, it appears to us that <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName> has carried the cause of the American industry
                            about as far as he can and that a negotiated settlement will require
                            that we modify our position on the comprehensiveness question.</p>
                        <p>If we legislate quotas, we are in for more difficulties in our relations
                            with Japan. These are outlined in the attached proposed memorandum from
                            you to the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">The draft memorandum to
                                the President asserts that impasse over textiles would contribute to
                                a deterioration of U.S.-Japanese relations. Acknowledging that many
                                of <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s difficulties on the
                                textile issue were of his own making, the memorandum states that
                                U.S. interests will be served if <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                    >Sato</persName> is strong enough to select his own successor.
                                The memorandum concludes with the suggestion, “We should now
                                identify those areas in which we could afford to make some
                                concession without sacrificing what is really essential, in the
                                interests of closing out this dangerous issue. The disappointment
                                our textile people might feel over failure to obtain all they seek
                                should be weighed against the corrosive effect this issue is having
                                on our long-term interests with this most important Pacific ally.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName> sent another
                                memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> on
                                February 10, buttressing the case and noting that telegram 1159 from
                                Tokyo, February 9, described the weakness of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s position. (Both

                        <p>These difficulties with Japan would be serious enough by themselves, but
                            mandatory quotas on textiles, even if the legislation could be so
                            limited, would have far-reaching effects on the entire structure of our
                            international relations. It would put this Administration in the
                            position of having closed the door of the American market to one of the
                            very few industries which in the years ahead will provide some
                            opportunity for the less developed countries of the world to sell to us.
                            It would establish a precedent—and even an obligation—for the indefinite
                            protection by legislation of the industry, and would distort our own
                            economic prospects by preserving in our midst, virtually <pb n="184"
                                facs="0215" xml:id="pg_184"/>forever, a low-wage industry. This adds
                            up to poor economics and bad public policy.</p>

                        <p>We believe that now is the appropriate time to bring to the attention of

                            that you send the attached memorandum to the President, and that you be
                            prepared to urge him to persuade the domestic industry that the national
                            interest requires that we settle for something less than the wholesale

                            policy toward Japan would be highly desirable at this time.</p>

                            forth a practical formula for our Japan policy, relying mainly on the
                            smooth execution of existing policies. That formula and the
                            psychological benefits from the Okinawa reversion decision defused the
                            widely anticipated “1969 crisis” in U.S.-Japan <pb n="185" facs="0216"
                                xml:id="pg_185"/>relations. In recent months, however, there have
                            been indications of increasing strains in the relationship as the
                            Japanese move toward greater independence and note with concern
                            directions and measures being urged in the U.S. which do not converge
                            with their own interests. As a result, established U.S. policies could
                            drift out of alignment with the realities of Japan’s changing
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>In the economic and political areas I believe there are several
                            indications of these problems. In the psychological area of our
                            relationship, I note that public opinion surveys and other assessments
                            of Japanese attitudes have tended to confirm the seriousness of these
                            strains. These developments appear to be particularly significant:</p>
                        <quote><p>—Economic frictions have aroused intense feelings which could
                                unsettle broad areas of our relationship.</p>
                            <p>—Some influential figures in Japan are disturbed by their perception
                                of applications of the Nixon Doctrine, and their feelings are
                                reflected in press and other media comment.</p>
                            <p>—Debates are sharpening in Japan over the congruity of American and
                                Japanese policies toward China.</p>
                            <p>—The Japanese official position in the Okinawa reversion
                                negotiations, in which our Voice of America transmitter figures
                                prominently, seems to reflect a certain sensitivity toward American
                                Congressional and public attitudes.</p></quote>
                        <p>Among the questions which a new <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                            review could examine might be these:</p>
                        <p>1. Might increasing nationalism make Japanese feel that close relations
                            with the U.S. are inhibiting their independence in Asia?</p>
                        <p>2. What will be the psychological effect of U.S. force reductions in East
                            Asia? Will the Japanese feel insecure? Will domestic Japanese pressures
                            build up for a large Japanese military establishment with offensive
                            and/or nuclear capabilities? Will our force reductions weaken
                            credibility and interest in American power and defense commitments?</p>
                        <p>3. Is there a psychological threshold for economic frictions beyond which
                            it will be difficult to sustain a productive basic relationship?</p>
                        <p>4. In the face of mixed Japanese inhibitions and ambitions and of
                            remaining anti-Japanese sentiment in East Asia, what type and degree of
                            Japanese involvement would most benefit U.S. strategic interests in the
                            area?</p>
                        <p>I believe that a review of the problems and opportunities confronting the
                            U.S.-Japanese relationship—which the President has termed the
                            “linch-pin” for peace in the Pacific—should be accorded a high
                            priority.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>I recommend that the Administration seek the advice and consent of the
                            Senate to the Okinawa reversion agreement. I base this on considerations
                            both of law and of our relations with the Congress. A decision should be
                            made now because of two factors: the status of reversion negotiations
                            with the Japanese and the need to begin consultations with the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>As you know reversion negotiations have proceeded quite slowly. The
                            Japanese have been resistant on some issues we consider essential to
                            reversion. A decision to seek the Senate’s advice and consent should
                            help to stimulate a more responsive Japanese attitude.</p>
                        <p>Senate action in 1971 is essential if we are to accomplish a smooth
                            reversion by mid-1972, which is the goal of both governments. Assuming
                            that the negotiations can be completed by that date, we should submit
                            the reversion agreement to the Senate by May 1, 1971, to ensure that the
                            Senate will complete its procedures before it adjourns this year. As a
                            first step in this process, consultations with the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee should begin soon. You earlier agreed that the
                            Administration would consult with the Senate both on the form of its
                            participation in the agreement and on the substance of the
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>During the early part of 1971, U.S.-Japanese textile negotiations
                            commenced with no prospect of settlement on the immediate horizon. While
                            government-to-government negotiations made only halting progress, there
                            were rumors about parallel negotiations between Congressman Wilbur Mills
                            (D–Arkansas) and representatives of the Japanese textile industry. On
                            February 26, 1971, <persName corresp="#p_BCF_1">C. Fred
                                Bergsten</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                            staff wrote a memorandum for President’s Assistant for National Security
                            Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> reporting that
                            the head of the Japanese industry had agreed to Mills’ suggestion that
                            Japan unilaterally restrain textile exports to the United States.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCF_1">Bergsten</persName> depicted this news
                            as an “apparent breakthrough.” (National Archives, Nixon Presidential
                            Materials, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Files, Box 400, Subject
                            Files, Textiles, Vol. IV, 1971) That same day, Mills, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, and a few other
                            attendees met for an 8:30 a.m. breakfast. A record of this meeting
                            indicates that “Mills went on at some length to develop for the
                            President Mills’ ideas about voluntary action by the Japanese to limit
                            their textile exports to the United States.” The President expressed
                            little interest in this topic and changed the subject back to hearings
                            and bills before the House Ways and Means Committee. (Ibid., White House
                            Special Files, President’s Office Files, Box 84, Memoranda for the
                            President, beginning February 21, 1971)</p>
                        <p>On March 8, the Nixon administration learned of an agreement negotiated
                            between Mills and the Japan Textile Federation that marked a new
                            development in the textile dispute between the United States and Japan.
                            The Japanese Textile Federation announced that it would adopt voluntary
                            export restrictions lasting 36 months. These restrictions would allow
                            Japanese textile exports to the United States to increase 5 percent for
                            the first year, 6 percent for the second year, and 6 percent for the
                            third year. The proposal was contingent upon other major textile
                            exporting countries (especially Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong)
                            adopting similar restraints. (Ibid., Nixon Presidential Materials,
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Files, Box 400, Subject Files,
                            Textiles, Vol. IV, 1971)</p>
                        <p>Following the Textile Federation’s declaration, Shigeru Hori, the Chief
                            Cabinet Secretary in Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s government, officially announced, “The Government
                            of Japan . . . considers that in view of this new development, it is no
                            longer necessary to continue the negotiations between this Government
                            and the Government of the United States which have been conducted by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>.” (Ibid.) On March 8 Mills
                            also issued a statement praising the proposal. (Ibid.) Meanwhile, on the
                            same day, Japanese Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> orally conveyed a message from <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> intended for <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. Of the voluntary export
                            restraints, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> noted, “I
                            realize that these <pb n="188" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_188"/>restraints
                            may fall short of the expectations of your Government, but strongly hope
                            that, taking into account the long-term considerations of friendship
                            between Japan and the United States, the understanding and the support
                            of your Government will be forthcoming so that it will be possible to
                            bring this difficult matter to a close.” (Ibid.) <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCF_1">Bergsten</persName> responded to the Japanese
                            textile industry offer by writing to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> that “the Mills initiative is a godsend” from
                            a “foreign policy and trade policy standpoint.” Yet, he noted, “The
                            Mills initiative also completely undercuts the Administration’s effort
                            to negotiate an arrangement consistent with the President’s commitment
                            to the textile industry.” (Ibid.) The next day, March 9, Senator Strom
                            Thurmond (R–South Carolina) who possessed close ties to the textile
                            industry, sent <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> a letter in
                            which he denounced the Mills agreement and asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> to repudiate it. (Ibid., White

                                >Shultz</persName>, and Presidential assistants <persName

                                >Peterson</persName>). <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName> prepared a memorandum sketching out options for
                            the President in anticipation of this meeting. (Ibid., Nixon
                            Presidential Materials, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Files, Box
                            400, Subject Files, Textiles, Vol. IV, 1971) According to a transcript
                            specifically prepared by the editors for this volume, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> said that Mills’ deal was “an
                            inadequate, a totally inadequate thing.” Later in the conversation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> commented: “The
                            Japanese have given us a bad deal. Mills is now holding us on a hook and
                            we’ve got to find a way to get off of it.” (Ibid., White House Tapes,
                            Oval Office, Conversation No. 464–9, 11:39 am–12:03 pm) A March 9
                            memorandum for the President’s file summarizes the meeting: “The
                            President was impatient with the suggestion that either the foreign
                            relations aspects of the problem should be considered, or that
                            consideration should be given to Mills’ sensitivity on the trade matter.
                            The President pointed out that Mills was a pragmatic politician who
                            would do with regard to each item of legislation what was in his best
                            interest. Mills would not, in the President’s opinion, let action on the
                            textile issue influence his position on welfare reform or revenue
                            sharing. The President concluded that it was necessary to send textile
                            quota legislation to the Hill. He instructed that a message be drawn to
                            indicate why the Japanese offer was inadequate, to indicate his
                            impatience with the Japanese government for unilaterally breaking off
                            negotiations, and stating that he would send legislation and would
                            monitor monthly Japanese imports.” (Ibid., White House Special Files,
                            President’s Office Files, Box 84, Memoranda for the President, beginning

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I cannot conceal my disappointment and concern at the course the textile
                            matter has taken.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d69"
                                    >Document 69</ref>.</note> I thought that last October we had
                            reached a good understanding which would lead to a mutually satisfactory
                            resolution of this problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d58">Document 58</ref>.</note> Already then the issue
                            had plagued relations between our two countries far too long, and
                            previous understandings had not been realized. At the time I received
                            your message of March 8,<note n="4" xml:id="d70fn4"><ref target="#d69"
                                    >Document 69</ref> describes <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                    >Sato</persName>’s message to <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>. The Embassy in Tokyo reported in telegram
                                2178, March 11, on a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1"
                                    >Meyer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                    >Sato</persName>. The Japanese Prime Minister said that his
                                country’s textile industry had acted without his approval and cut
                                the ground from under the Japanese government’s negotiating
                                position. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                                expressed regret that he had “failed” to meet <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s expectations, and warned
                                that if the U.S. Government publicly criticized the Japanese
                                proposal, this would facilitate Communist China’s efforts to drive a
                                wedge between the United States and Japan. (National Archives, Nixon

                                Box 536, Country Files, Japan, Vol. IV, 1/1–6/30/1971)</note> as
                            well as the statement of the Japan Textile Federation, <pb n="190"
                                facs="0221" xml:id="pg_190"/>accompanied by the statement of your
                            Chief Cabinet Secretary, it had been my impression that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> were finally making some real
                            progress in their talks. These statements thus came as a complete
                            surprise. As you know, those statements were very promptly followed by
                            the statement of the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who
                            is a member of the Democratic party.</p>
                        <p>All of this would be of little importance if the unilateral steps taken
                            by your industry would have come reasonably close to meeting our needs
                            here, with which you are familiar. In any event, if unilateral action of
                            this kind was to be taken I would have hoped that it could have at least
                            been consistent with the area of agreement at which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> had arrived.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I am sure that you will have noted that the approach taken
                            by the Japanese industry has been violently and unanimously attacked by
                            all members of the American industry and its supporters, including those
                            in the Congress. Thus, rather than resolving this problem, I fear that
                            it has led to increased controversy.</p>
                        <p>However, what has been done is done and, while I would much prefer that
                            we continue our efforts to find a mutually satisfactory negotiated
                            solution, I understand from your message and from your talk with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1">Meyer</persName> that you do not
                            feel that this is possible. I thus see no way of resolving the matter
                            unless over a period of time the Japanese Federation, with the
                            cooperation of the Japanese Government, were to so administer the
                            controls as to be consistent with our needs here, as Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> has previously outlined them
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As you will see from the statement that I am issuing today,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d70fn5">See <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Nixon,
                                    1971</hi>, pp. 423–424.</note> I have felt it necessary to
                            instruct my officials to observe closely the actual development of
                            textile imports from Japan, in order to determine the manner in which
                            the Federation carries out its pledge to prevent undue distortions in
                            the pattern of the trade. I hope that our officials can keep in close
                            touch on this matter. In the meanwhile, I am sure that you understand
                            why I felt it necessary today to reiterate to the Congress my support
                            for legislation to protect the American textile industry.</p>
                        <p>I deeply regret, Mr. Prime Minister, the necessity of writing you in this
                            vein. However, I felt it best that you have a clear and frank
                            understanding of the situation and problems that I face here, for I
                            continue to believe it is only by such frank understanding between us
                            that we can handle this matter in a manner that will assure that this
                                <pb n="191" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_191"/>issue not impair those
                            relations of friendship and cooperation between our two peoples which
                            are of such overriding importance.</p>

                            of the right political answer on textiles, for a tough, <hi
                                rend="italic">unilateral</hi> action on your part which is more
                            under your control than that taken by a potentially unfriendly Congress.
                            As long as Congress has the ball, there is obviously a very real
                            possibility that it will either do nothing on textile quotas or give you
                            a bill including so many added products that you will be presented with
                            a major dilemma, (especially if the bill is attached to another major
                            piece of legislation).</p>
                        <p>This paper discusses one such unilateral possibility.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Background:</hi> In the past, it was contemplated that
                            once we had an agreement with Japan, we would move to enforce
                            restrictions on other major Asian textile producers, namely, Taiwan,
                            Hong Kong and Korea, under Section 204 of the Agricultural Act. (None of
                            these nations has shown any desire to follow Japan’s lead in exercising
                            unilateral restraint.)</p>

                            showing no inclination to renew negotiations, we should now consider the
                            desirability of opening negotiations with the other Asian textile
                                producers.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2"><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                        <p>If successful, you could then unilaterally limit imports from Japan and
                            from other countries, if necessary. It is the kind of option that will
                            require extremely careful planning, delicate and yet purposeful
                            negotiation, and clearly, some luck since the odds probably don’t favor
                                it.<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3"><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                            good way of evaluating its chances or its costs until we think through a
                            set of specific negotiating packages so that we can assess it in a more

                            along with the cotton agreement) is a “significant” part of world trade
                            in textiles and apply quotas to Japan unilaterally. If this approach is
                            to be realistically evaluated, we need to think through the costs and
                                <pb n="193" facs="0224" xml:id="pg_193"/>concessions that might be

                            provide a means within a few months to permit your establishing an
                            adequately comprehensive textile quota system unilaterally, and at the
                            same time, minimize the chances of your getting an unacceptably broad
                            protectionist trade bill.</p>
                        <p>2. It could provide an additional lever to apply against the Japanese in

                        <p>3. We probably need to negotiate soon with these other countries on

                            “significant” part of world trade and involves some legal risks. (It is
                            the preliminary opinion of John Dean and lawyers from STR and Commerce
                            that the President should reasonably have substantial flexibility to
                            interpret the phrase “significant part of world trade.”)</p>
                        <p>2. Would involve putting major pressure on these other important Asian
                            allies. (We would, of course, not know the magnitude of these pressures
                            and their costs until we lay out a specific negotiating plan.)</p>
                        <p>I should also say this possibility does not preclude other legislative
                            approaches to the problem, or a new multilateral textile negotiation

                        <p>After the initial greetings, Mr. Yamanaka remarked that he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> comprised a “tight
                            team” working together for the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party. Mr.
                            Yamanaka had intended to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> to write a letter of introduction for him to
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>; however, before
                            his departure for the U.S., Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> had asked him to meet with the President, so there
                            hadn’t been time for him to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> to write an introductory letter to Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, recalling that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> had been a former
                            student of his, said that any friend of <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName>’s was always welcome, with or without a
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka noted that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> had been two of four staff members working for
                            Mr. Kono Ichinomo of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>. This
                            group had later divided up two and two, with Yamanaka and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> forming “an attack team.” Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked what an
                            attack team did, and who it was attacking? Mr. Yamanaka replied that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> was very undecided
                            as to the object of the attack—he sometimes cooperated with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, and sometimes
                            attacked him. Mr. Yamanaka asserted that he always supported Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, and that was the
                            difference between them. Occasionally there was dissention between
                            Yamanaka and <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName>, but they
                            saw the advantage of working together. Their efforts were complementary,
                            each having points which the other lacked.</p>
                        <p><pb n="197" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_197"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> commented that he hadn’t been in Japan for a
                            long time, so he had no knowledge of what was going on in the political
                            situation. Mr. Yamanaka said that if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> was interested in the Japanese political
                            situation, especially what might take place immediately after the
                            retirement of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                            >Sato</persName>, he would be happy to go into this for Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he wanted first
                            to give Mr. Yamanaka the opportunity to talk about anything which
                            concerned him. Mr. Yamanaka remarked here that he hadn’t any particular
                            concern in mind, he simply wanted to brief Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated that as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> knew, one
                            problem with which he, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, was very much concerned with was Okinawa, and
                            this he didn’t regret; another problem, however, was textiles, which he
                            did very much regret. Mr. Yamanaka interjected that he felt some way
                            would surely be found to deal with the textiles issue. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> went on to observe that he
                            would say just one thing and then drop the subject—it would be a serious
                            mistake to underestimate in Japan the bitterness and sense of outrage
                            with which the textile issue was greeted in the U.S. This was all out of
                            proportion to the matter. By way of explanation, he had that same day
                            overruled a proposal from a very high source that we should hold up
                            signing the Okinawa agreement until we had some guaranteed agreement on
                                textiles.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">Before the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>–Yamanaka meeting,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> rejected a
                                proposal from <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">David Kennedy</persName>,
                                suggesting that the United States condition its signing of the
                                Okinawan reversion agreement upon a resolution of the textile
                                problem. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1"
                                    >Holdridge</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>, June 1; ibid.)</note> He had overruled
                            this proposal because he didn’t want to put the textile issue on that
                            high a plane, and would not even submit it to the President. <hi
                                rend="italic">But</hi>, the fact that such a proposal could be made
                            at all by people who had the right to go directly to the President

                        <p>Continuing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated
                            that there was also a possibility we would have trouble getting the
                            reversion of Okinawa ratified by the Senate. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> commented at this point that
                            he was personally sick of textile negotiations and didn’t want to get
                            involved in any more of them. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> asked what the Japanese might do. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that he wouldn’t
                            make suggestions on this. The tragedy was that Japanese-U.S. friendship
                            was the keystone of peace in the entire Pacific area. If we were divided
                            over big issues, that at least would be understandable, but it was
                            absurd for the future of the Pacific area to depend on an essentially
                            commercial issue. Mr. Yamanaka remarked that he had come here in part in
                            order to have an interview with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> about textiles. Speaking frankly, the feeling in
                            Tokyo about the textile issue was quite different from <pb n="198"
                                facs="0229" xml:id="pg_198"/>what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had conveyed about the impression here. After
                            he returned to Japan, he would convey the “true situation” personally to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and would
                            offer his advice.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> told Mr. Yamanaka
                            he could be sure that Japan couldn’t have two people in the White House
                            more dedicated to the future of Japan than the President and himself.
                            The President considered Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK_1"
                                >Aichi</persName> as personal friends in addition to being officials
                            of a great country. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> reiterated that he had no specific problem on
                            textiles to convey, and simply out of friendship wanted to convey an
                            impression of the sentiment here. As Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> knew, he had not injected
                            himself in any of the detailed textile discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> was afraid his personal relationship with the
                            President, which he regarded as being a man-to-man one reflecting mutual
                            confidence, was being undermined. That was why Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> had asked Mr. Yamanaka to convey
                            his “loyalty” to the President. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> remarked that he didn’t know what could be
                            done to resolve the textile issue, but we would be having Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> there and anything
                            which could be worked out with him would certainly ease matters greatly.
                            We would certainly have to see what the future brought. There would be,
                            though, no underrating of the importance to us of Japan and of
                            U.S.-Japanese friendship. Mr. Yamanaka expressed the belief that he
                            could certainly influence Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> by talking to him personally upon his, Yamanaka’s,
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked for
                            confirmation that the textile issue remained a key factor in the
                            President’s mind. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            explained that it had the unfortunate effect of raising a lot of
                            irritation—our people felt that on two separate occasions things were
                            supposed to have happened which didn’t. For the President, the biggest
                            problems with Japan were our commercial relations. Our long-term
                            political relations were not bad; in fact, they were very good, and we
                            wanted to strengthen them. But this was an example of the sort of
                            irritation which any critic of the Administration could build upon if he
                            wanted to do so. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            remarked that this was not his particular field; indeed, he tried to
                            remain out of it all and up until a year ago didn’t even know what a
                            category was.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            whether, when he was speaking about irritations, this meant that the
                            President was personally irritated with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied that this would be putting it too
                            strongly. Nevertheless, the President had a political problem with
                            respect to textiles which he had explained twice to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. On one occasion, he had
                            not even wanted to raise the textile issue, but had done so at Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s request. Thus, the
                            President <pb n="199" facs="0230" xml:id="pg_199"/>didn’t have any
                            personal irritation, other than the fact that the textile question made
                            it easier for critics to raise issues which two years ago hadn’t even
                            existed as problems. That was the source of his irritation. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> probably knew that at
                            the time of the Okinawa negotiations the President had broken every
                            deadlock in favor of Japan, not out of sentimental reasons, but out of
                            profound conviction that the U.S.-Japanese relationship would determine
                            the future of the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka noted with respect to the Okinawa agreement that the time
                            for signature was approaching. On the U.S. side, there was opposition to
                            the agreement on the part of the military, while on the Japanese side
                            there was the opposition of the Okinawan people. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> wanted to overcome all
                            this opposition. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            assured him that we would get the agreement concluded this month. Mr.
                            Yamanaka explained that he was the Minister in charge of the Okinawa
                            negotiations, and wanted to express his personal thanks for what Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had just said. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated that we
                            were not acting out of sentimental reasons but in the belief that our
                            political relationship with Japan was more important than military bases
                            on Okinawa. Mr. Yamanaka asked, did Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> mean that because in the Okinawa negotiations
                            the President had overcome all deadlocks, it was now the Prime
                            Minister’s turn? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            answered that this wasn’t the case, he was just describing the
                            President’s attitude. He personally didn’t think that we should link
                            Okinawa to the textile issue. This was a commercial problem, while
                            Okinawa was an historical problem. The Japanese could anticipate
                            difficulty in the Senate, though. Speaking as a friend, and in all
                            honesty, he had heard more complaints about Japan in connection with
                            commercial policy than on any other issue. For himself, he was
                            determinedly anti-economic, and didn’t care one way or another.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka said that since he and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had discussed textiles to such an extent,
                            could he ask if there should be a government agreement in settling the
                            textile issue? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            expressed the opinion that it would be profitable to have a government
                            agreement, but this seemed to be beyond the ability of the Japanese
                            textile industry to accept. Every negotiator we had put on this matter
                            had become infuriated, first Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"
                                >Stans</persName>, then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FP_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName>, and now we had Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> complaining and asking for
                            drastic methods. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            observed that he was doing half of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName>’s job by trying to keep
                            everything under control here. He didn’t know what the reasons for these
                            harsh attitudes were. He had once known the details of the question, but
                            was now trying hard to forget them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka stated that while he was not in charge of textile affairs
                            and not commissioned to discuss them, as a Cabinet Member <pb n="200"
                                facs="0231" xml:id="pg_200"/>and a Minister in the Prime Minister’s
                            Office, he had some influence and would talk about the problem when he
                            got home.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> mentioned that
                            the Japanese textile industry would be implementing its voluntary
                            restraints on textiles beginning in July. To this Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that his people said
                            that what the Japanese textile industry was doing wasn’t enough, and
                            didn’t mean anything. He had decided that contrary to what diplomats
                            believe, ignorance made the best negotiator, and that was what made him
                            so good. He was completely ignorant, and hence was immune to what the
                            Japanese said.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">When <persName

                                sentence.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka, somewhat taken aback, asked if Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was being sarcastic. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> denied being
                            sarcastic and said that he was being serious. Mr. Yamanaka asked
                            whether, if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was
                            really being serious, he was still a friend. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> assured him that he could
                            count on his still being a friend. He just wanted to give the mood here,
                            and this had nothing to do with his personal feelings toward Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> or his personal
                            friends in Japan. He had the good fortune—too long ago—to pay two visits
                            to Japan, and had a great affection for that country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka wondered whether it might be possible for him to meet with
                            the President, despite the shortness of time, to express Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s concern over his,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s relations with the
                            President. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said he
                            would see what could be done, but it might be difficult. The President
                            was preparing for a press conference that night which had already taken
                            him two days. He and Mr. Yamanaka belonged to the “Union of Special
                            Assistants to Prime Ministers and Presidents,” so he understood Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s and Mr. Yamanaka’s
                            kind of concern. Mr. Yamanaka agreed that he and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> belonged to the same union.
                            Had this not been the case, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> would not have entrusted him with this special
                            mission and he himself would simply have gone on to the Environmental
                            Congress. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> promised
                            to do what he could, but hoped that Mr. Yamanaka would understand that
                            with a three-day weekend followed by a press conference the President’s
                            schedule had been incredibly disrupted. Mr. Yamanaka could be certain,
                            though, that he would report to the President immediately. Mr. Yamanaka
                            said that he did understand, and that even for the Japanese there would
                            be so much business on the desk after a three-day weekend that they
                            would be very busy during succeeding days. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that when the
                            President had a <pb n="201" facs="0232" xml:id="pg_201"/>press
                            conference he withdrew for two days and nobody saw him, not even Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. His calendar then
                            got impossibly jammed up. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> remarked whimsically that he was angry with
                            the President for picking this time—there was a dinner party which Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had wanted to
                            give, but he now had to watch the press conference on television.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka thought that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s advice had surely preceded the President’s
                            speech. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> indicated
                            that he did this in writing, and gave a book of suggested questions and
                            answers to the President, who would then call him on the telephone. He
                            had, in fact, actually seen the President the previous night. Were there
                            press conferences of this sort in Japan? Mr. Yamanaka said that there
                            were, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> recalled
                            that when we had been assembling a task force to deal with the Korean
                            crisis of 1969 (the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–121 incident) the
                            Japanese press had flown over our task force and had been fortunate not
                            to have been shot down. They had come with blimps and everything else.
                            This had been in the Straits of Tsushima, where in 1905 the biggest
                            naval battle in history had been fought between the Russians and the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka recalled that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> had given a press conference on the day of his,
                            Yamanaka’s, departure, and he had appeared together with the Prime
                            Minister. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed
                            that he wasn’t allowed to appear with the President here. As Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> knew, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was very retiring and some
                            days didn’t appear in the newspapers at all. To this, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> mentioned that there
                            were 5 or 6 pictures of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> which had been taken in the Japanese Embassy
                            during visits by well-known Japanese. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that he had the Japanese Embassy
                            infiltrated.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that he
                            had run a seminar program in Harvard, in which there had been many
                            Japanese students. One of these was Fujita, who was now a well-known
                            television commentator. Mr. Yamanaka expressed some surprise at this
                            since Mr. Fujita was older than Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> pointed out that this was a special program,
                            and quite a few students had been older than he. He went on to express
                            his pleasure at seeing Mr. Yamanaka, and asked him to convey his warm
                            regards to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>.
                            He should stress that despite all criticisms, friendship with Japan was
                            our basic policy. Mr. Yamanaka said that he would certainly convey
                            everything Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had
                            said to the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yamanaka wanted to know if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had examined the Okinawa treaty, and if he
                            could give a judgment of its conditions. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that he had indeed
                            examined the treaty. Mr. Yamanaka felt on the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                                >VOA</gloss> issue the Japanese could take legislative action which
                            would provide for U.S. access to the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                                >VOA</gloss> facilities for five years, with <pb n="202" facs="0233"
                                xml:id="pg_202"/>consultations on the question after two years. On
                            another matter, since there was no civil airport on Okinawa, the
                            Japanese wanted Naha airport to be returned so it could be transferred
                            to the Ministry of Transportation. To this end, the U.S. P3 squadron
                            would need to be transferred. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted that we were in a position of talking to
                            a few generals about this. They were on bread and water right now and
                            would give up very soon. (He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1"
                                >Holdridge</persName> if this remained a problem, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName> said that it did not.) Mr.
                            Yamanaka went on to say that on the Japanese side, they were prepared to
                            bear the expenses for the return of the airport. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said he believed that
                            everything would be worked out, and asked if Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> agreed. (Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> did.) It was not official yet,
                            but he believed we were moving in a positive direction. Mr. Yamanaka
                            mentioned that this would bring a very good change in the mood of the
                            people of Okinawa and of the main Japanese islands. At this point Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stressed that what
                            he had said should be regarded as unofficial.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded with Mr. Yamanaka and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> hoping that Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> would be able to iron out the
                            last details of the Okinawa reversion agreement at the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> meeting so that the signature of the
                            agreement could still take place about mid-June. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was confident that this
                            would be done.</p>

                        <p>Under Article 3 of the Peace Treaty, the US acquired administrative

                            the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands).”</p>
                        <p>The term “Nansei Shoto” was understood by the US and Japan on the basis
                            of a 1939 Japanese map to include the Senkakus Islands which were being
                            administered as a part of Okinawa prefecture. (The <gloss

                        <p>The US has been administering the Senkakus as part of the Ryukyus since
                            the conclusion of the peace treaty.</p>

                            December 25, 1953) defined the territorial jurisdiction of the US Civil

                            Islands as “all those islands, islets, atolls and rocks and territorial
                            waters” within specific geographic coordinates that included the Senkaku
                            Islands. (In an oral presentation on September 15, 1970 and in its note
                            of March 15, 1971 the <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss> took the
                            position that it did not challenge the inclusion of the Senkakus in the

                            in the Ryukyus as important to the maintenance of regional
                            security.)</p>

                        <p>The ECAFE survey, made by a group of scientists from the United States,
                            Japan, the Republic of China, and South Korea, found that the

                            richest oil reserves in the world. The Senkaku Islands lie in an area
                            that gives promise of oil resources. Japanese interest in affirming
                            sovereignty over the Senkakus probably was inspired by the possibility
                            that it could thereby strengthen its claim to a portion of the
                            continental shelf.</p>

                            concern at deterioration of U.S.-Japanese relations, primarily because
                            of current economic problems are reflection of growing feeling in Japan
                            that some sort of anti-Japanese campaign is developing in the U.S. Worst
                            of all, feeling has begun to develop that this wave of criticism may
                            have at least tacit support of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Problems between U.S. and Japan are real and some are quite serious, but
                            at root are underlying psychological problems stemming from mutual
                            misunderstandings and cultural differences. Japanese media further
                            complicate matters by disproportionate coverage they <pb n="209"
                                facs="0240" xml:id="pg_209"/>give to all U.S. stories remotely
                            concerning Japan and by crisis mongering manner in which they are
                            frequently played.</p>
                        <p>Although Japan has virtually achieved super-power status in terms of
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, it has not yet developed any
                            coherent plan concerning its role in Asia and rest of the world.
                            Insecurity and uncertainty characterize many of their responses to
                            outside world. Combined with vestigial feelings of inferiority toward
                            West in apposition to their own national pride, Japan is faced with
                            overcoming formidable psychological difficulties in coming to terms with
                            newly-achieved power status. Buffeted by these factors, Japan is often
                            irrationally affected by outside criticism.</p>
                        <p>While foregoing cannot justify Japanese actions or failure to act on
                            certain problems, it does represent fact of life in dealing with Japan.
                            This is particularly true in criticism of Japan from U.S. sources owing
                            to heretofore “special relationship” which has existed and which has
                            tended to buffer the shock waves of specific problems in the past.</p>
                        <p>Japanese leadership elites now gradually becoming aware of intensity of
                            American dissatisfaction over certain aspects of relationship, and it is
                            much in our interest to accelerate progress in adjusting to new power
                            relationship, but the way we go about it is extremely important at this
                            juncture. In order to eliminate much of impending sense of crisis in
                            Japan about relationship with U.S., Embassy strongly recommends that
                            U.S. <hi rend="italic">official</hi> statements and actions be designed
                            to defuse inherent emotional content of complicated issues by putting
                            them into perspective rather than by stimulating anxieties through
                            rhetoric. We also believe that more intimate forums outside of the glare
                            of publicity should be developed to promote frank exchanges between
                            leaders of two countries.</p>
                        <p>Because of intimacy and interdependence of Japan-American relationship,
                            we have no lack of tools to influence quietly and pressure Japanese
                            policy in favorable direction. Most of all, despite current
                            difficulties, there exists in Japan a broad reservoir of good will
                            towards U.S. which, because it is such a rare thing in today’s world, is
                            something not only to be exploited but to be prized and preserved. <hi

                            new Cabinet lineup, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has
                            sought to accomplish two things before his anticipated retirement in the
                            Fall of 1972:</p>
                        <p>—First, by switching <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Takeo Fukuda</persName>
                            from Finance to Foreign Minister, he has sought to broaden <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>’s experience and contact with
                            foreign affairs, and by adding to his already extensive economic
                            experience, further qualify him to take over the reins from <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p>—Secondly, the Fukuda appointment together with that of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Kakuei Tanaka</persName> to the powerful Ministry
                            of International Trade and Industry, has brought two of the most
                            influential Japanese politicians to positions of key importance to the
                            U.S.-Japan relationship. If <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> cooperates with the Sato policy of easing
                            economic tensions with the U.S. as expected, <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> will be able to claim some status as a
                            diplomat/statesman, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> will
                            have manuevered himself into a good position to succeed <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> will be able to exit under conditions in which the
                            relationship is not under so much pressure as at present.</p>
                        <p>In terms of U.S. interests, the new Cabinet lineup promises to offer some
                            hope for greater cooperation from Japan in the economic sphere,
                            including, perhaps, textiles. According to the Japanese press, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            see the first principal tasks facing the Cabinet as the alleviation of
                            strains in the US-Japan relationship created by economic issues. Should
                            this <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> strategy fail, the
                            succession could be in question <pb n="211" facs="0242" xml:id="pg_211"
                            />and we may be faced with mounting, rather than decreasing, economic
                            frictions with our best customer and the strongest nation in Asia.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> the U.S. would maintain

                            intended to improve the quality of its forces, that it was not
                            economically practical for Japan to have an independent defense
                            industry, and that he hoped the U.S. would lend assistance with advanced

                            aimed at improving U.S.-Japanese relations, and that he had specifically

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I have just completed a very fruitful round of discussions with
                            Ambassador-at-Large <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">David M.
                                Kennedy</persName> regarding the current textile negotiations in the
                            Far East which he is conducting as my personal envoy. As a result, I
                            would like to personally reaffirm to you the very great importance which
                            I attach to settling the textile issue. I must, as well, reluctantly
                            express my regret upon learning that progress toward reaching accord
                            with Japan has been delayed.</p>
                        <p><pb n="213" facs="0244" xml:id="pg_213"/>While I recognize that the
                            decision which you must make involves far-reaching political
                            considerations, I would like, nonetheless, to emphasize the fundamental
                            importance to the future course of U.S.-Japanese relations which
                            resolution of the textile issue between the United States and Japan now
                            entails. This is a matter which I know you appreciate as fully as I do,
                            and I am happy to see this appreciation reflected in your recent cabinet
                            realignment and the public statements which members of your cabinet have
                            made emphasizing the importance of materially improving U.S.-Japanese
                            economic relations. I am confident, therefore, that your decision on the
                            textile issue will afford us the opportunity to make great strides in
                            this direction.</p>

                        <p>The Department of Defense has been endeavoring, since <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 13 was published in May 1969, to

                            altering our base structure. During my recent visit I tried to advance
                            your policies even further. Special attention was given (a) to
                            confirming our Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security; (b) to
                            encouraging increased effectiveness, through qualitative improvements,
                            in the Japanese Self Defense Forces; and (c) to soliciting a larger
                            Japanese role in Asia, especially through economic and supporting
                            assistance. As I shall explain later, I believe there are reason and
                            opportunity to ask Japan to play a more effective—if not a
                            larger—national security role.</p>

                            enjoying the conversation as much as I. He was forthright on a number of
                            what I considered to be key points. He said, for example, that the
                            essential pillars of your foreign policy—strength, partnership, and a
                            willingness to negotiate—were fully understood at the top levels in
                            Japan. They were not fully understood at lower functioning levels,
                            however. He observed, without coaxing, that Japan needed to do more in
                            the security and foreign policy arena. At one point, he stated
                            explicitly that the Self Defense Forces should be modernizing at a more
                            accelerated and meaningful pace. At another point, he said Japan was
                            considering an economic stabilization fund to help stem the inflationary
                            tide in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Japanese/US relationships, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> said he had specifically instructed his newly
                            appointed Foreign Minister, Minister of International Trade and Finance
                                [<hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>], and Finance Minister on the need
                            for mutual cooperation and trust. He indicated his cabinet should, and
                            must, grasp the significance of the US/Japan relationship. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> said he and his cabinet would work
                            closely with us on a “coherent” trade policy. I pressed hard on the need
                            for more Japanese purchases from the US, particularly in the Defense
                            area. The current annual level of $95 million is not representative of
                            Japan’s needs, its ability to buy, or bilateral trade situation. A
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> comment that I
                            considered especially intriguing (though the US Embassy representatives
                            did not) was, in essence, that “in case of emergency, the Japanese
                            industrial might will be at the disposal of the US.” I did not press
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> on the precise meaning
                            or implications of the remark. Potentially, however, the implications
                            are substantial and important for the US.</p>
                        <p>On Defense relations, I told <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            that the US Congress consistently pressed the Administration on whether
                            there was true partnership in our security relations with other Free
                            World nations. Specifically, I said, there was Congressional reference
                            to the 7 percent, or more, of Gross National Product (<gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>) the US devoted to national security
                            as opposed to the 1 percent or less provided by Japan. I tried to
                            impress on <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that despite the
                            $16.6 billion to be dedicated to defense in <pb n="216" facs="0247"
                                xml:id="pg_216"/>Japan’s current (i.e., the 4th) five-year plan,
                            such expenditures were still inadequate. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that I had had the privilege of
                            visiting selected Ground Self Defense Force and Air Self Defense Force
                            units. I had been struck by the facts that (a) much of their equipment
                            was old and no match for that of other Asian powers, and (b) attempts to
                            retain adequate numbers of trained personnel and attract new ones to the
                            Japanese all-volunteer forces were not universally successful. The clear
                            need, if Japan was to fulfill even a modest foreign policy role—and with
                                <hi rend="italic">no</hi> increases in the size of the forces—was
                            for increased defense spending. More specifically, I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> that in my judgment, Japan needed
                            to:</p>
                        <quote><p>—Replace obsolete equipment in all of its branches with more
                                modern weapons.</p>
                            <p>—Flesh out its forces and retain its trained people through more
                                adequate incentives and compensation.</p>
                            <p>—Improve the effectiveness of its forces through regional joint
                                training exercises, particularly in air defense and anti-submarine
                                warfare.</p>
                            <p>—Adapt to Asian security needs, especially through providing economic
                                and supporting assistance to those Free World Asian nations in dire
                                need of such support.</p></quote>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> said he did not [?] intend to
                            improve the quality of the Self Defense Forces. He did not believe, as
                            some Japanese did, that it was feasible to have a fully-independent
                            Japanese defense industry. He hoped the US would lend some assistance,
                            particularly with regard to advanced technology.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister repeated a theme consistent among Japanese officials,
                            viz., the importance of the US nuclear shield and the hope the US would
                            maintain a sufficient nuclear deterrent. Japan worries about how long it
                            can defense [defend] itself against aggression without the nuclear
                            shield. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> expressed doubt
                            regarding the ability to deter war with conventional weapons, but he
                            agreed Japan should not be too dependent on us in the conventional field
                            and needed to improve its conventional strength. I emphasized (a) the US
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had achieved strategic
                            nuclear parity; (b) conventional forces will take on added importance in
                            the 1970’s; and (c) the Free World nations need an effective
                            conventional deterrent. Unlike the strategic nuclear area, all Free
                            World nations can and must join in partnership to muster the strength
                            needed for adequate conventional deterrence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was especially interested in
                            the People’s Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>)
                            and, more specifically, any key intelligence we might be able to share
                            with him. I outlined in broad terms the recent <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> developments in aircraft, conventional ground force
                            equipment, and the strategic field. I also indicated we would share
                            additional information with him on a close-hold, confidential basis. I
                            shall, at your convenience, discuss that with you privately.</p>
                        <p><pb n="217" facs="0248" xml:id="pg_217"/><persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> commended our Vietnamization policies and commented
                            on the much lower recent levels of US casualties. I observed that if
                            there were a weak element in the Vietnamization program, it was in the
                            economic area. That is where Japan can help now and over the near-term
                            future. It was at this point <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            told me he was studying the possibility of an economic stabilization
                            fund for Southeast Asia (<gloss target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss>). Such a
                            fund, if correctly conceived and prudently administered, could help in
                            the universal fight against <gloss target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss>
                            inflation and balance of payments disequilibriums.</p>
                        <p>Again, the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was
                            congenial, yet forthright. He impressed me as a man who, though faced
                            with many troublesome and delicate issues is definitely in charge.</p>

                        <p>The meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> was
                            unusual in a sense. He literally had only hours—if not minutes—left in
                            office when I talked with him on 5 July. He will remain influential in
                            the Liberal Democratic Party, however. It is conventional wisdom to
                            suggest we shall see and hear more of <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> over the coming years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> covered a number of the
                            same topics outlined in the Sato discussion. I did have to spend more
                            time with <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> than with the
                            Prime Minister explaining your foreign policy and the Administration’s
                            national security strategy for the 1970’s. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> was particularly interested in the concept of
                            Total Force Planning. I had the feeling, based on subsequent
                            discussions, it was good for some of our own people to hear the US
                            policies and programs enunciated. (Our Ambassador and his
                            politico-military counsellor accompanied me to each of the

                        <p>Turning to the list of items we had discussed in September 1970, when
                                <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> was my guest in the

                            General expressed gratification for a number of actions. Significant
                            among the actions had been realignments of the US basing structure in
                            Japan and, of course, the perpetuation of our Mutual Security
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> expressed the conviction
                            that future US/Japanese problems could be handled effectively. He
                            referred especially, as did other top Japanese officials, to economic
                            and trade issues. On defense matters, <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> felt the treaty could be managed to maintain
                            the vital ties between the US and Japan. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> also described the 4th Defense <pb n="218"

                            underway. While the $16.6 billion five-year program is better than
                            previous plans (more than twice the most recent plan), <persName
                                corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> did not make a convincing case
                            (a) that the current plan was enough, (b) that the plan represented
                            coherent outlays in conjunction with a realistic security strategy, or
                            (c) that Japan could not afford to do much more.</p>
                        <p>As with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> was vitally interested in US
                            policy toward the People’s Republic of China. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> we were proceeding cautiously
                            and that, from a military standpoint, I could see no imminent
                            fundamental changes on either side. Again, <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> expressed intense interest in any military
                            intelligence the US could share with Japan on the <gloss

                            somewhat cynical about recent <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            foreign policy activities—actions which <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName> characterized as “a policy with a smile.”</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] The real reason for
                            such a plan was to provide <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s
                            party with political ammunition. The four points <persName

                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> I would look at
                            his proposition. But, I referred him to your communiqué with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and the express
                            call for mutual trust.<note n="6" xml:id="d80fn6">See <ref target="#d28"
                                    >Document 28</ref>.</note> I suggested the effectiveness of the
                            nuclear umbrella, as a deterrent, was based on mutual awareness and
                            mutual trust. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] Moreover,
                            I commented that those who enjoy the fruits of our nuclear deterrent
                            should be willing to help us to help them. (I was referring, of course,
                            not only to the Okinawa issue but also to the recurring problems caused
                            for our forces by the Japanese sensitivity to the real or imagined
                            presence of nuclear weapons in their immediate proximity.) [<hi
                                rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] I was impressed by the
                            fact a senior Japanese official would make such a statement, though our
                            Embassy people commented later it was not particularly new or
                            noteworthy. I believe, whatever the vintage of the idea, it has
                            considerable potential significance.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Masuhara.</p>
                        <p>Though newly appointed as Director General when I met with him, Masuhara
                            is no newcomer to the defense field. As you know, he held the post now
                            called Director General when the function was created in the early
                            1950’s. My initial assessment is that he will bring depth, maturity, and
                            considerable practical savvy to the position.</p>
                        <p>As with the Prime Minister, I met with Masuhara after I had had the
                            opportunity to visit Self Defense units and installations and to talk
                            with senior US and Japanese military officials. That experience helped
                            me. I could express with more conviction the fact that Japan could do
                            more to further its own security interests, particularly in the area of
                            making more effective the forces in its current and projected plans.</p>
                        <p>I explored with Masuhara the prospects for modernizing and increasing the
                            effectiveness of all its Service elements—ground, sea, and air. I also
                            raised the prospect for making more effective—as opposed to
                            enlarging—its regional security role. Participation in joint training
                            exercises—particularly air, sea, and command post maneuvers—with US and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> forces is a logical area to
                            explore. Officer exchange programs and periodic top-level discussions
                            among key civilian and military officials are other areas which, if
                            managed correctly, could add immeasurably to more effective regional
                            security.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise, in the discussions with Masuhara, the points covered were
                            duplicative of the conversations with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                            >Nakasone</persName>. The Masuhara meeting was considerably more narrow
                            in scope than either of the other two talks. The one point raised with
                            Masuhara that did not come up otherwise was my request for consideration
                            of pre-positioning the families for 6 US destroyers and one US aircraft
                            carrier in Japan. Actually, the 6 destroyers can and will be considered
                            separately from the carrier. The DDs constitute a relatively benign
                            issue. The carrier involves political sensitivities for the Japanese. I
                            did not make a formal request at the time of our meeting but did ask for
                            Japanese thinking on the subject. Masuhara said he understood the
                            proposal, and would communicate, after study, Japan’s official views
                            through our Embassy.</p>
                        <p>As with the other senior Japanese officials, the talk with Masuhara was
                            warm and friendly. Harmony and commonality of Free World interests were
                            at all times evident.</p>

                            <p>—Japan is intent on preserving and strengthening its security
                                relationships with the US. I was particularly impressed by <persName

                            <p>—Japanese officials at the top understand—at least since my trip—the
                                basic tenets of your foreign and national security policies.</p>
                            <p>—Japan is reaping substantial benefits from the security provided by
                                other major and developed Free World nations. Japan is not sharing
                                proportionately in assuming the cost and burden of that
                                security.</p>
                            <p>—Japan wants the US to maintain an effective strategic nuclear
                                deterrent and to provide Japan the opportunity to maintain a
                                position under that so-called “nuclear umbrella.”</p>
                            <p>—In the conventional area, Japan’s forces are markedly obsolescent.
                                It is not clear what threat, other than internal disturbances, the
                                current Self Defense Forces could handle.</p>
                            <p>—Japanese officials understand and at least give lip-service to the
                                need for modernizing and making more effective its Defense
                                establishment. The modernization would be limited solely to
                                conventional weapons.</p>
                            <p>—While there are many areas in which Japan could and should bolster
                                its conventional deterrent, there is no prospective role for
                                Japanese nuclear weapons. Such use of Japanese resources would, in
                                fact, be a gross political, economic, and military mistake.</p>
                            <p>—The Japanese are deeply interested in activities of the <gloss

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 13 can continue to serve as a
                            sufficient basic guideline for US policies toward Japan. More
                            specifically, however:</p>
                        <p>a. There may be ways to improve our basic relationships from the
                            viewpoint of US national interests and to provide for an increasingly
                            larger Japanese role in Asia. On the former point, regularized personal
                            consultations between top US and Japanese officials in the military,
                            economic, and diplomatic arena would be in my judgment productive. On
                            the latter point, cultivation of such ideas as the Japanese
                            stabilization fund for <gloss target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss> and vastly
                            expanded supporting assistance throughout the other free nations of Asia
                            would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>b. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security can be continued. It
                            should not be taken for granted, however.</p>
                        <p>c. Our base structure and base utilization in Japan have been effectively
                            realigned. We should not be hesitant, however, to ask for further
                            realignments in our behalf, particularly where such realignments
                            directly help to facilitate the US nuclear and conventional deterrents
                            which benefit Japan directly.</p>
                        <p>d. We should not only encourage but virtually insist on qualitative
                            improvements and increased effectiveness in Japan’s Self Defense Forces.
                            While we need not modify <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 13 to
                            suggest substantially large forces or a larger regional security role,
                            we should emphasize <pb n="221" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_221"/>the theme
                            of quantum jumps in effectiveness in both Japan’s forces and its
                            regional security posture.</p>
                        <p>2. Japan has no need for developing or otherwise obtaining any nuclear
                            weapons. In fact, given the many higher priority prospective uses for
                            Japanese resources, we should openly oppose any such contemplation by
                            Japan if it were to occur.</p>
                        <p>3. Japan, despite its acceptance of the principle of force modernization,
                            shows no immediate prospects of increasing its annual outlays for
                            security. We should take every feasible step to encourage Japan to do
                            so. Resources should be used within the policy guidelines of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 13, to (a) modernize their forces,
                            (b) acquire in full measure the planned SDF manpower levels, (c) insure
                            that current SDF units are effective and well trained, (d) participate
                            in joint exercises to accentuate further the force effectiveness, and
                            (e) help to provide the supporting assistance needed elsewhere
                            throughout Asia. Japan may be tempted to use arguments of convenience to
                            avoid assuming its equitable share of the Free World Security burden.
                            Avoidance of rising or resurgent Japanese militarism is one such
                            argument. The economic needs of the Japanese people (redistributing
                            income) who have not yet shared fully in the fruits of its miraculous
                            post-World War II growth is another such argument. We should, in my
                            judgment, not allow such arguments to gain undue currency. Japan can and
                            should—within your conceptually and practically sound policy
                            guidelines—do more.</p>

                            be entirely impossible for any Japanese Prime Minister, for it would

                            point, but that the Chirep issue was very complicated. I assured him
                            that our objective continued to be to do all possible to maintain the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss> seat in the U.N. We then had a
                            detailed discussion about the various U.N. alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Among the other points made by <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> during our conversation were the following:</p>
                        <p>1. A fundamental policy objective of Peking was to split Japan off from
                            the U.S. and “neutralize” it.</p>
                        <p>2. Peking will “not soften” on its refusal to do business with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and his wing of the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> in the hope and expectation that
                            increasing pressure from the Socialist and Komeito parties, as well as
                            from the left wing of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>, will
                            eventually force the formation of a more “neutral” government that will
                            be willing to loosen its ties with the U.S. to meet the popular demand
                            in Japan for improving relations with Peking.</p>
                        <p>3. During the Diet debate on the Okinawa Agreement, which will come the
                            middle of October, the opposition will include among its attacks the
                            following points:</p>
                        <quote><p>A. With the improvement of relations between the U.S. and Peking,
                                the U.S. bases on Okinawa are “outdated.” Thus there is no
                                justification for the U.S. retaining extensive military facilities
                                on Okinawa, and Japan should not exacerbate its problems with Peking
                                by permitting the U.S. to retain those facilities.</p>
                            <p>B. As the sudden move of the U.S. with respect to Peking shows that
                                Japan cannot give “credibility” to the U.S., no “credibility” can be
                                given to U.S. assurances that nuclear weapons are being removed from
                                Okinawa. (<persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said there
                                were of course answers to these charges, but they nevertheless would
                                have considerable appeal to many Japanese.)</p></quote>
                        <p>4. The political crisis to the position of <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> and his supporters would probably come during the
                            Diet session that opens in January. It would not come in the form of a
                            direct non-confidence vote in the Diet, but rather in the form of a move
                            within the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> to replace <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> with someone more acceptable to
                            Peking. Such a move would be more likely if <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> had had to use “strong arm” methods to get the
                            Okinawa Agreement through the Diet in October, and would be even more
                            likely if the U.S. had not ratified the Okinawa Agreement by the January
                            session of the Diet.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> that I very much
                            appreciated his frank analysis of the situation and agreed that it was
                            going to be necessary for both Governments to keep in very close touch
                            with each other to avoid the problems that he foresaw.</p>

                        <p>Begin text. The Japanese Government welcomes your recent decision to
                            visit China in the belief that the improvement in the Sino-American
                            relations will contribute to the reducing of tension existing in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Japan, however, cannot but feel deeply concerned over the future
                            development in the relationship between the United States and China, as
                            it is bound to have an extremely important influence upon the situation
                            in Asia.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3"><persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                    >Sato</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">David
                                    Kennedy</persName> on July 24, and “raised the question of the
                                President’s decision to make a trip to Peking. He started by saying
                                the President’s trip has thrown his entire nation and, for that
                                matter, the entire Far East into a period of speculation and
                                concern. The speculation is relevant to the question of what
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> intends to
                                accomplish and the concern particularly relates to whether or not
                                the U.S. was changing her stance with respect to former allies. Does
                                the U.S. intend now to drop her ʽlittle friendsʼ by the wayside in
                                order to take up a relationship with the ʽbig boysʼ. The Prime
                                Minister repeated these expressions several times. He said he had
                                always followed the ʽbossʼ in these policy matters but this time he
                                was left out and caught unprepared with both the Diet and the press.
                                He also touched on the fact that President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> was going to Peking and not
                                vice-versa, implying that the U.S. had already make a most
                                significant concession in the oriental way of thinking in the Far
                                East.” <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> sent this

                        <p>Turning away from the textiles problem, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that he had wanted to talk with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> about recent
                            events. He recognized the shock that these events (his visit to Peking
                            and the announcement of the President’s trip) had caused Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, and had read the
                            account of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>’s
                            conversation on this subject with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d81">Document 81</ref>.</note> He very much regretted
                            this <pb n="226" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_226"/>situation. Maintaining a
                            close friendship with Japan was an absolutely key element in US policy,
                            which our agreement on Okinawa had been intended to establish on a
                            concrete basis. The last thing we wanted to do was to change our
                            relationship with Japan.</p>
                        <p>In this instance, however, there had been a particular problem. Our
                            domestic pressures were such that if anything had come out in advance,
                            they would have become so great as to either kill the visits or raise
                            expectations unduly. We had a security problem in the Government, and
                            there were actually many senior officers in it who knew no more than
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. Also, to be
                            candid, our dealings with the Japanese were not entirely free of leaks
                            on the Japanese side. These were not on major issues, but they did
                            exist.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            continued, we did not know how to handle the problem of getting word to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. Originally
                            there had been some thought given to his, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s, going to Korea as a
                            pretext for visiting Peking, in which case he would have stopped in
                            Japan and seen Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                                >Laird</persName>’s trip to Korea had then been announced, though,
                            and this could not easily have been turned off. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wanted Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> to understand that what he was
                            saying was completely confidential.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out that
                            the past was now behind us, and we had to look to the future. We wanted
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> to know that,
                            first, we really considered our relationship with Japan as the center of
                            our policy in the Pacific; and, second, that we are not replacing Japan
                            with China. We want Japan as a friend, and while we also want
                            discussions with the Chinese, we are under no illusions that we will be
                            able to change their basic orientations. On our side, we have the
                            greatest interest in maintaining our old channels of communications, and
                            even of strengthening them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that on
                            communications one problem was that we did not have a private channel to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. We had once
                            believed there was one on textiles, but occasions had arisen in which
                            our bureaucracy was told by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s bureaucracy about private communications which
                            we had kept from our people. Speaking on behalf of the President, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> if he could make a
                            proposal to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            to “put these two gentlemen in touch with one another.” Perhaps he, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, could speak with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> on sensitive
                            matters, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            could give the message privately to Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>; the Japanese for their part might
                            do the same for us. Some mechanical arrangement for this might be set
                            up. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that
                            the Japanese might make a proposal on this; he personally did not know
                            how it might be done. Confidentially speaking, we had such an
                            arrangement with one or two other governments, for example the
                            British.</p>
                        <p><pb n="227" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_227"/>Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> would certainly make
                            some proposal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            emphasized that the major thing for the people in Tokyo to understand
                            was that we were most eager to strengthen our relations. As the man who
                            conducted the US talks with the Chinese, he could assure Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> that there were no
                            surprises in these talks, and no secret deals.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> declared that
                            from the long range standpoint the President’s future visit to Peking
                            was a good thing for the world and for Japan, but in the short term
                            would cause problems in Japan. Oka of the <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi> had written about the shock and resentment created among
                            staunch friends of America in Japan. This was not because of the
                            concerted pressure of events, which was understood in Japan, but because
                            the President’s going to China was such an extraordinary thing from the
                            Japanese point of view. There were “too many lawyers” in Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>’s country, and these
                            had come to the conclusion that there must have been some US commitment
                            to Peking in connection with the normalization of US/<gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relations, and since this was not
                            possible from the Chinese point of view without the US dropping its
                            relationship with Taiwan, the US must, therefore, be ready to drop
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that he
                            could assure Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            there were no such commitments. He remarked that he was the only
                            American who couldn’t possibly have lost his shirt in his conversation
                            with the Chinese because he didn’t have one in the first place. He had
                            forgotten to pack his own shirts and had been obliged to borrow two
                            shirts from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName>, who was present,
                            could verify this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, could Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> see the logic in
                            the Japanese suspicions? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied that he could see their logic, but it
                            simply wasn’t true, it had the disadvantage of being incorrect.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wanted to know
                            how the Chinese could tell Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> that he was welcome and not at the same time
                            ask the US to do this, i.e., break off with Taiwan. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asserted that he was not
                            saying that they didn’t raise the problem. However, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> would see that when the
                            President went to China we would still have an Ambassador in Formosa.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered if the
                            outcome of the visit would not be a break with Taiwan. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stressed that he did not
                            expect any such outcome. The President could not possibly do this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> remarked again
                            that the Japanese were surprised over the fact that the President would
                            be paying a visit to China. This was an extraordinary thing from the
                            Japanese point of view, and so everyone naturally jumped to a
                            conclusion. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed
                            that it was not too usual for a head of state to visit a country with
                                <pb n="228" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_228"/>which his own country had
                            no relations. Indeed, this may never have happened before.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> surmised from
                            what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had said that
                            the Chinese had not pursued too deeply the matter of US breaking
                            relations with Taiwan. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that he didn’t want to go into his
                            conversation in Peking too closely. The Chinese had certainly expressed
                            their point of view, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> should not expect a break in relations with
                            Taiwan as an outcome. It would be inconceivable that the President would
                            or could break off relations established over a generation as a result
                            of his visit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that in making
                            this observation he hoped what he was telling Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> would not appear in the Japanese
                            press. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said
                            that he would report only to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> and the Foreign Minister. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> hoped that they would be on
                            their guard, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> assured him that they would be very cautious. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, referring to past
                            leaks, observed that there was no evidence that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> personally was involved in them.
                            The only foreign ministry, though, which leaked more than the Japanese
                            was our own. Ours couldn’t keep any secret at all.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wanted to know
                            if Vietnam had been discussed in Peking. The Japanese were very
                            concerned about the outcome in Vietnam. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that if we had wanted to sell out
                            Vietnam, we didn’t have to go to Peking to do it, but could accomplish
                            this in Paris. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            commented that for a peaceful settlement, the support of China would be
                            needed to bring one about. To reach a definite conclusion in Vietnam,
                            the cooperation of the Chinese was needed. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that this might be
                            the case. He noticed that Hanoi was yelling every day about great power
                            pressures being placed against it. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> concurred, adding that to this
                            extent at least, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            Peking trip had been quite effective. He raised the question again of
                            whether, except for discussing peace in a broad framework, there had
                            been any commitments. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> declared that none had been made either on our
                            side or on the Chinese side. This was the first time any senior American
                            official had a chance to talk to senior Chinese officials, and the
                            conversations were, therefore, in the nature of an exploration.</p>
                        <p>“Ah so, an exploration,” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> remarked. If he could say so, the Chinese would
                            be quite happy to see an American President in Peking. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> could possibly imagine
                            that we had invited ourselves to Peking? A more logical way to have this
                            happen was for the side which wanted the other side to come to extend
                            the invitation. There were no preconditions, and we wouldn’t have
                            accepted any even though, as circumstances worked out, the issue never
                            arose.</p>
                        <p><pb n="229" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_229"/>Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> raised as his next question
                            (admittedly a far-fetched one) what possible advantage there would be
                            from the US point of view if the President had a talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> in Peking and returned home
                            without any visible result? Was this possible? Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> what he would consider an
                            advantage from the US point of view, to which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> suggested some kind of Chinese
                            commitment to a solution in Vietnam, and at least no acts of violence
                            regarding Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait—something like that. For example,
                            if Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> were to go
                            to Peking to have talks, this fact alone would limit action on Japan’s
                            part.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that if this
                            Administration had proved anything, it had shown that it was able to
                            ride out public opinion. We had done this for three years now, and would
                            continue to do what we believed was right. We didn’t expect any big
                            results in Peking. In any event, we would keep in close touch with the
                            Japanese on the President’s trip, although there might be some minor
                            things which we couldn’t discuss.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that it was
                            hard to know what public opinion would expect out of any announcement
                            following the President’s visit. What was startling about the last
                            announcement was not the content but what had actually happened. With
                            respect to the President’s visit, however, he, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, not only did not expect,
                            but was certain, there would not be any bombshell coming out of the
                            meeting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            observed that this was reassuring for them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> expressed the view
                            that from the standpoint of our immediate problem, the moves toward the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> were the right thing to do;
                            from the long range standpoint, though, our relationship with Japan was
                            extremely important. We had arranged the first visit without discussing
                            it with the Japanese, but it didn’t have any content. It would be
                            inconceivable that if it had had content, or would have been
                            inconsistent with the views of the Japanese, that we would not have
                            discussed it with them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered where

                                <pb n="230" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_230"/>trip. He didn’t believe
                            that Peking would necessarily be happy over the way things would work
                            out. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> thought
                            that Taiwan might possibly feel that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s trip and the announcement of the President’s
                            proposed trip might have diminished its chances in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> this fall. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> acknowledged that there
                            might be some tactical questions involved here, but we would
                            nevertheless proceed along the line which we had discussed with the
                            Japanese. As for the President’s trip, we were not operating under the
                            assumption that we were doing the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            any favor. If the Chinese didn’t want this trip, they would find an
                            excuse to cancel it; if they wanted it, it would take place. We simply
                            couldn’t throw over an ally of 25 years standing, and would actively
                            support it in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> remarked that it
                            was most important that the US actively support Taiwan. He wondered what
                            tactics the US proposed to follow. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted that the tactics issue was one which did
                            not concern the White House as much as it did State, where much better
                            information was available. The point he wanted to stress was that we
                            would make a significant effort to keep the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, which was
                            the major issue we were concerned with. Nothing had changed as a result
                            of his visit to Peking. The Japanese knew that we were going in that
                            direction—i.e., better relations with Peking—anyway.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> recalled that
                            Taiwan’s position was that if the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>
                            lost its Security Council seat, there was not much point in keeping the
                            General Assembly seat. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> commented that our decision was to fight for
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> anyway regardless of what it
                            did as a matter of principle.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, what was
                            the timing of the President’s visit? Would it be before the General
                            Assembly debate, that is, before the end of October? Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that this would be a
                            surprise to him and that he wouldn’t expect the trip to come that soon.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> pointed out
                            that “some people” were guessing the President might go in September
                            because this would be a convenient way to deal with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> issue. There were rumors to this effect
                            in Japan. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded that there have been no discussions at all on the timing,
                            although these might start very soon. It was his impression that the
                            trip could not take place before the end of the year at the very
                            earliest, and there was a good chance it would not be this year at all.
                            The earliest that it could be technically feasible at all was the end of
                            the year.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered if Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had noticed any
                            adverse reaction from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, for
                            example, in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks? Dr. <pb
                                n="231" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_231"/><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied that he hadn’t noticed any difference.
                            We did not intend to let the Soviet attitude figure in on the
                            President’s visit because this would be giving the Soviets a veto.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> again asked if
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> foresaw any great
                            impact on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks, and Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied
                            negatively. Of course, if the President went there (to Peking) at the
                            time the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks were going on and
                            behaved as if we were engaging in an alliance against the Soviets, this
                            might happen.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated what he
                            had said before about private communications. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> should feel free, particularly
                            if he had a message of sensitivity and importance, to get in touch with
                            him, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. The
                            President had asked him to make this point.</p>
                        <p>Another point which the President had wanted him to raise was to pass on
                            the information that when the Japanese Cabinet Council delegation came
                            in September, the President wanted to give a dinner in its honor.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> would be seeing
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> in the morning
                            and would be hearing this from him as well, and should work out the
                            arrangements in the State channel. Again, we wanted to do what we could
                            to continue our close relationship with Japan, and if the Prime Minister
                            or Foreign Minister had something which they wanted to get to the
                            President, they should do so through Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The enclosed response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 122 was
                            substantially completed before President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>’s announcement of his intention to visit Peking.
                            That announcement caused major shock waves in Japan. The Japanese will
                            be some time in sorting out the implications for their domestic
                            politics, their own position with respect to Peking and Taipei, and the
                            relationship with the United States. Initially, however, the fact that
                            Japan was not consulted about this move has been interpreted within
                            Japan as a heavy blow to the waning prestige of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, the more so because it came on
                            the heels of a series of other political setbacks for the conservative
                            leadership. It has also inspired speculation in Japan about the future
                            of the US/Japan relationship, demands for a more “independent” foreign
                            policy, and fears and recriminations about Japan’s own China policy.
                            Most importantly, it greatly complicated the domestic political
                            situation, raising doubts about the ability of the mainstream elements
                            of the ruling party, those who have promoted the close relationship with
                            the US and the <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss>, to survive the
                            ferment.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese, however, tend to overreact to surprises. It will therefore
                            not be possible to assess the lasting impact of this development on
                            Japan’s internal political alignments or its view of the US/Japan
                            relationship until more about its future direction is known and more of
                            the dust in Japan has settled. For the moment, the possible adverse
                            effects on the US/Japan relationship can be tempered by acting with an
                            awareness that this development has shaken the position of those who
                            favor a close relationship with the US and on whom we must rely to
                            achieve our goals with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, this suggests a resumption of the closest possible
                            consultation with the Japanese on the China problem, including tactics
                            at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. It suggests avoiding the
                            appearance of a soft US policy toward Peking and an excessively tough
                            policy toward Japan.</p>
                        <p><pb n="233" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_233"/>Things seemingly unrelated to
                            China also apply in this context, since everything we do for the
                            immediate future will be interpreted in Japan in terms of how important
                            we regard Japan in comparison with China. For example, the Japanese will
                            be looking with special anxiety now to see how we treat the Emperor’s
                            stopover in Anchorage in September, and at the degree of support given
                            by the Administration to the Okinawa Reversion Treaty. Finally, Japan’s
                            responsiveness to our economic pressures can also be influenced by the
                            extent to which the leadership sees Japan’s interests affected by China
                            policy developments.</p>

                                    >Kissinger</persName>, noting: “The Departmental paper as it now
                                stands is seriously deficient, particularly as regards its
                                parochialism and its lack of integration.” <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName> commented, “These
                                deficiencies reflect the enormous contention between State, which
                                fears the damage which several of the economic agencies (Commerce,
                                Treasury, Agriculture, and <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peter

                                have their way, and these economic agencies, which are inclined
                                toward heavy pressures on the Japanese as the only way of bringing
                                Japan around on trade and investment matters. The conservatism of
                                the ʽPeace Blossom Societyʼ in State (the old Japan hands) was also
                                such that State refused to consider any basic options other than to
                                maintain our present Japan policy even though events may move either
                                the U.S. or Japan away from the relationship which now exists.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName> continued that
                                the August 6 <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> meeting should be
                                used to integrate the economic and security aspects of U.S. policy
                                toward Japan, as had failed to occur in the original paper. The
                                interdepartmental group responsible for drafting both the original
                                and summary papers, acted, according to <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1"
                                    >Holdridge</persName>, “at our insistence to give some unity to
                                the paper and to lay out genuine options.” As to the summary paper,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName> felt that it
                                “fails to define the policy problem at the outset clearly in terms
                                of the inter-relationships between, on the one hand, reducing
                                tensions with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and
                                ameliorating our trade problems, and, on the other inducing Japan to

                        <p>Japan is the second largest and the most dynamic industrial power in the
                            free world, and the only non-Communist power in Asia. Japan’s economic
                            capacity is growing rapidly; if present trends hold, Japan’s <gloss

                            potential, if freed from present inhibitions, could be formidable.</p>
                        <p>A pivotal factor in determining the state of the entire Pacific area
                            during the 1970’s and beyond will be the evolution of the relationship
                            between the United States and Japan. Neither Communist China, the Soviet
                            Union nor the smaller nations of the Pacific can remain indiffer<pb

                            States, as a review of the past half century or a look at any projection
                            of Japanese growth will show, there is no relationship which offers so
                            great a potential for mutual benefit—or for misunderstanding and
                            misfortune. There is one basic question: What can be done to maintain a
                            friendly and constructive relationship between the US and Japan? The
                            other issues are subsidiary to this.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> US Interests:</p>
                        <p>At present, Japan is critically dependent on us, politically,
                            economically and militarily, but the US also has a major stake in
                            preserving the relationship, including broad interests we would not wish
                            to endanger to achieve other goals:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Political stability in Asia:</hi> Japan is a major
                            factor today; despite domestic inhibitions in Japan and apprehensions
                            about Japan in third countries, Japan’s dynamic economic performance
                            will ultimately translate itself into corresponding political influence,
                            which will be tempered by the alliance with the US. Japan has so far
                            chosen to pursue a non-military great power role and, barring a major
                            rupture with the US, would probably persist in this line.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Trade:</hi> Japan is our second largest, and by far
                            our most rapidly growing, export market; it is a matter of highest
                            concern that this market be aggressively exploited and that steps be
                            taken to assure maximum feasible access to American exporters and
                            investors.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Reduction of tension in Asia:</hi> This long-term
                            process will deeply involve Japan, notably in the evolution of the
                            relationship among Japan, China and the US. It will require the
                            avoidance of new tensions between China and Japan, which would surely
                            arise if Japan became dubious about US security commitments and if Japan
                            were to acquire a major military force.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Nuclear non-proliferation:</hi> The development of
                            nuclear weapons by Japan would be highly destabilizing by itself and
                            could prompt others to follow. Japan’s policy of rejecting nuclear
                            weapons rests in large part on Japan’s faith in the US deterrent.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Burden sharing:</hi> We want Japan to contribute more
                            to the stability and development of East Asia in partnership with us;
                            Japan is the only nation of Asia that has a significant stake in Asian
                            development as well as the resources with which to promote it.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Use of Japanese facilities to meet US security
                                commitments in East Asia:</hi> In order to carry out our defense
                            commitments to our allies in Asia, including Japan, we must have the
                            maximum feasible use of our bases in Japan and the closest cooperation
                            of the Japanese Government.</p>

                            highly successful. The agreement to permit the reversion of Okinawa,
                            which preserved the essentials of our military position, weakened the
                            psychological basis for public opposition to the Security Treaty and
                            helped preserve the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>’s political

                            the China debate. But to date the policies laid down in <gloss

                            overall political and security aspects of this key relationship.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Japanese Scene</hi>—Despite pressure from political
                            elements antagonistic to close ties with the US, the present ruling
                            elements in Japan and their heirs would probably prefer to continue the
                            close relationship with the US through this decade and to avoid the
                            acquisition of a major military establishment. In Japan, where the
                            political leadership must contend with intense intraparty factional
                            rivalries, a generally hostile media, and extra-parliamentary
                            harassment, while building a consensus for policy action, major
                            departures develop very slowly.</p>
                        <p>Today’s leaders are the political descendents of former Prime Minister
                            Shigeru Yoshida, who decreed over 20 years ago that the preservation of
                            a close relationship with the US was essential at any cost. Their own
                            political skill, their demonstrated success and the lack of an issue on
                            which the badly fragmented opposition could combine against them seems
                            to assure that they will remain in office. Furthermore, the accumulated
                            inertia of the past 20 years, good prospects for continued economic
                            expansion, and the vast benefits of our relationship seem to ensure that
                            they will continue to follow Yoshida’s dictum for as long as the basic
                            premises remain valid—the credibility of our security guarantee, an
                            opportunity for political and economic growth, and a reciprocal US
                            attitude about the importance of the relationship.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese are not psychologically prepared to abandon a policy that
                            has served them so well. Economically aggressive, growth and
                            export-minded, they still have not developed any consensus for a
                            Japanese political or security role beyond their borders. Japanese
                            policy to date has, outside of the relationship with the US and, to a
                            lesser extent, the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss>, carefully avoided direct entanglement
                            with foreign regimes and concentrated on multilateral endeavors where
                                <pb n="236" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_236"/>political exposure is
                            limited. Deep cultural and psychological barriers close Japanese society
                            to the rest of the world, except on Japanese terms and public opinion
                            remains opposed to foreign involvements and large scale re-armament.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Catching Up</hi>—Americans tend to assume from Japan’s

                            economic growth that Japan’s economic prosperity is secure and that the
                            Japanese have a living standard that is rapidly approaching our own. The
                            Japanese feel that Americans are overly impressed by Japan’s post war
                            “economic miracle” and have a distorted view of Japan and its position
                            in the world.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese view their economic achievements as the result of nearly a
                            century of patient and determined effort to build a modern economy,
                            organized in the image of the West but designed to avert Western
                            domination. On the basis of their own experience of the past forty years
                            the Japanese regard their economic position as extremely fragile,
                            considering that Japan is almost totally dependent on the outside world
                            for natural resources in contrast to the continental powers which are
                            for all practical purposes wholly self-contained.</p>
                        <p>Japanese are acutely aware that Americans and many Europeans are
                            individually vastly better off than they by any standard of measurement
                            in terms of living conditions and social overhead. They are, in effect,
                            still striving to catch up and feel they have a long way to go.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Factors for Change</hi>—There are factors that could
                            compel Japan to abandon its reliance on the US. There is the sheer
                            arithmetic of Japan’s growing economic involvement with all of Asia and
                            the rest of the world, which has already caused serious friction between
                            the US and Japan. There is also the American drawback from Asia which
                            has led to unease in some Japanese circles about the credibility of our
                            security commitments. China’s emergence on the world stage could also
                            alter Japan’s stance, and Japan’s latent emotionalism and racial
                            sensitivities could be roused by frustrations or slights arising from a
                            denial of the status which Japanese feel is warranted by their
                            accomplishments.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The China Problem</hi>—The China problem is especially
                            delicate because of its tremendous importance to Japanese domestic
                            politics. This goes well beyond the question of whether or not the US
                            consults with Japan on China policy developments, although that is
                            certainly part of the problem. The more important aspect is that,

                            virtually the entire spectrum of the opposition and from within its own
                            party ranks, the ruling mainstream of the Liberal Democratic Party has
                            clung to its strong and longstanding ties to the <gloss

                                >LDP</gloss> leadership is continually vilified by Peking, whose
                            propaganda proclaims that Japan’s present rulers are reviving Japanese
                            militarism. Japan and China are far more likely to be bitter rivals for
                            influence in Asia than not, and the Japanese <pb n="237" facs="0268"
                                xml:id="pg_237"/>leadership feels that Peking’s main objectives are
                            to bring down the Sato Government and split the US-Japan relationship.
                            For these reasons, moves by the US in the China field have an immediate
                            and potentially explosive impact on the domestic political fortunes of
                            the conservative leadership, and in turn on the US-Japan
                            relationship.</p>

                        <p>There are roughly four broad options for the future conduct of US
                            political and security relations with Japan. The complexity of our

                            would have a major impact also on our ability to attain our economic

                                with the United States at least through the mid-70’s and probably
                                well beyond.</hi> Under the Fourth Five Year Defense Plan, 1972–76,
                            Japan will significantly strengthen its ability to defend the home
                            islands, plus Okinawa, against conventional attack—a threat which the
                            Japanese do not consider large. Japan’s ability to project military
                            power beyond its surrounding waters and airspace will not have increased
                            appreciably. Japan’s defense expenditures will remain at something less
                            than 1% of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> under this plan;
                            nonetheless, in absolute terms, Japan’s expenditures for defense will
                            more than double under this plan, which calls for a total outlay of some
                            $16 billion.</p>
                        <p>It is doubtful that the United States, even if it were desirable, could
                            obtain a substantial revision of the Fourth Defense Plan short of a very
                            drastic pull-back of the United States from the Western Pacific and a

                            possibilities, however, for adjustments in Japan’s security role within

                            greater than ours, since Japan’s entire foreign policy is based upon it.

                            Japan’s next major policy goal. It will become crucial to Japan if the

                            likely, there is greater rivalry and tension between Tokyo and Peking,
                            Japan will find it increasingly intolerable to play Asian second fiddle

                            non-communist Asia and perhaps within Japan itself. However, Japan’s
                            self-esteem would suffer grievously if Japan were barred from
                            participation and its willingness to support the results—and to provide

                        <p>In spite of a vast and profitable trade between us, our economic problems

                            with one of the world’s major industrial powers.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">VIII.</hi> The Economic
                            Problems</p>
                        <p>Three inter-connected problems can be delineated in the US-Japan economic
                            relationship. The balance-of-payments position of both countries is in
                            serious disequilibrium. US imports from Japan are growing fast and are
                            leading to widespread apprehension and hostility by much of American
                            business and labor. Japan maintains restrictions on imports and on
                            investment from abroad out of keeping with its new economic <pb n="242"
                                facs="0273" xml:id="pg_242"/>strength, while other countries besides
                            the US maintain restrictions against Japan.</p>
                        <p>1) The US balance of payments is in excessive deficit and the Japanese
                            balance of payments is in excessive surplus. In both countries the
                            problem is acute and requires early attention. While the US payments
                            problem is of long standing, it has become much more serious in recent
                            months as our traditional trade surplus has given way to a trade
                            deficit. Meanwhile, Japan, whose balance-of-payments position was a
                            precarious one until a few years ago, has moved into solid surplus but
                            its mentality has not adjusted rapidly enough to this shift.</p>
                        <p>This is not to say, however, that the problem is purely a bilateral one.
                            Each country is in disequilibrium with the world as a whole, and the
                            measures that are adopted to deal with the balance-of-payments problem
                            by each country must take into account the impacts on trade and payments
                            with third countries.</p>
                        <p>The fact that Japan is in excessive surplus and the United States is in
                            excessive deficit does not necessarily mean that there is an adversary
                            relationship between the two countries in the balance-of-payments area.
                            Japan has much to gain from reducing its surplus. Instead of adding
                            further to its reserves (which have increased from $3 billion in 1968 to
                            more than $7 billion now), Japan could make better use of its resources
                            to meet pressing needs for social capital and to improve the living
                            standards of Japanese consumers. The United States has much to gain,
                            particularly in terms of world monetary stability and the ability to
                            fulfill political and economic objectives, from reducing its deficit.
                            Thus the issues in the balance of payments area concern <hi
                                rend="italic">how</hi> to achieve the obvious goal of better balance
                            in the payments positions of each of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>2) The rapid growth in US imports from Japan is the most visible and
                            dramatic aspect of a more general US problem: a sharp rise in total
                            imports relative to domestic spending and output. Whatever can be done
                            to deal with the general problem will also help solve the specific
                            problem of imports from Japan. Beyond this, difficulties will no doubt
                            remain with respect to specific industries that are injured by imports.
                            For these cases, remedies in the form of escape clauses and adjustment
                            assistance exist but need to be improved. A return of the economy to
                            full employment will also help. The open issue concerns the advisability
                            of specific import restrictions by the United States or export
                            restrictions by Japan. The debate on this issue turns on the trade-off
                            between reducing the pressure of imports on employment and profits in
                            specific industries and imposing costs on other sectors of the US
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>3) Japanese import restrictions take the form not only of tariffs or
                            quotas but also of various other non-tariff barriers, both formal and
                                <pb n="243" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_243"/>informal. It is clearly in
                            the US interest that these practices be abandoned.</p>
                        <p>The US Government also seeks a dismantling of Japan’s restrictions on
                            investment in Japan. There is disagreement about whether the gains from
                            US investment in Japan would be offset by short-run balance-of-payments
                            losses and the disaffection of US labor concerned with “exporting
                            jobs.”</p>

                        <p>Japan is beginning to recognize that its substantial economic progress
                            has reached the point where policies of economic nationalism are no
                            longer compatible with its own interests, with those of its major
                            partners, or with the requirements of the international economic
                            system.</p>
                        <p>Since 1968 Japan has been liberalizing its restrictions over foreign
                            trade and investment. This has been accelerated recently and in June
                            Japan announced an 8-point program designed to deal with our current
                            economic problems. As a result, during the rest of this year we will see
                            a further reduction in Japanese controls over trade and investment:</p>
                        <p>—By September, Japan will have substantially reduced the number of items
                            subject to import quotas which are inconsistent with <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—Since July 1, Japan has had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> formal limitations
                            on direct or portfolio investment abroad by their nationals.</p>
                        <p>—Though foreign investment in Japan is still heavily restricted, recent
                            policy statements and specific actions (for example, Chrysler’s joint
                            venture has been approved and General Motors’ negotiations are all but
                            formally completed) suggest that a thawing is under way.</p>
                        <p>—An extensive shakeup at the senior levels of the Ministry of
                            International Trade and Industry may signify a switch from <gloss
                                target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss>’s traditional restrictive approach
                            to foreign trade and investment to a new, more international approach.
                            Of the senior hierarchy, the vice minister, deputy vice minister and all
                            bureau directors save one have lost their jobs. The new Japanese
                            government has given better relations with the US top priority.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, Japan continues to maintain import and investment
                            restrictions that are more onerous than those maintained by any of our
                            major trading partners. Among the import restrictions are the import
                            licensing system, “administrative guidance”, and the standard method of
                            settlement. The investment restrictions effectively bar majority foreign
                            ownership in the bulk of Japan’s industries.</p>

                        <p>There is general agreement in the US Government on the broad US
                            objectives in our economic relations with Japan. We would like to
                            see:</p>
                        <p><pb n="244" facs="0275" xml:id="pg_244"/>—the removal of Japan’s

                            balance-of-payments surplus which could help to reduce the US
                            deficit.</p>
                        <p>But we do not agree on the priorities each of these objectives should be
                            given, on the exact interpretation of each objective, and, most
                            important of all, how these goals are to be achieved.</p>

                            Open to Us</p>
                        <p>There are three broad lines of approach open to the United States in
                            dealing with the economic problems in our relations with Japan. These
                            options range from (1) taking general, multilaterally-directed measures
                            to alleviate U.S. trade and payments problems, to (2) increasing
                            diplomatic pressures on Japan within the existing international
                            framework, to (3) developing a centrally-directed strategy which would
                            involve unprecedented bilateral commitments from Japan to help resolve
                            our trade and payments problems with Japan.</p>
                        <p>These options are constructed to provide graduated pressures or leverage
                            in US-Japan negotiations, with Option 1 representing relatively minor
                            pressure and Option 3 representing quite heavy pressure.</p>
                        <p>Option 1. <hi rend="italic">Take prompt, multilaterally-directed measures
                                to eliminate or alleviate US trade and balance-of-payments problems,
                                without directing actions at Japan in particular.</hi></p>
                        <p>A. Take steps to improve the US balance-of-payments position via measures
                            of general applicability. Such measures would include action to obtain a
                            better international alignment of exchange rates, to bring about a
                            better distribution of the free world’s defense and aid burdens, and
                            various short-term, stop-gap provisions not directed against our
                            economic relations with any one country in particular.</p>
                        <p>B. Protect injured US industries against the burden imposed by too-rapid
                            adjustment to increased imports by prompt and vigorous implementation of
                            available safeguards, including escape-clause actions, anti-dumping
                            provisions, adjustment assistance and full use of our <gloss

                        <p>C. Take the lead in a worldwide program of reducing all types of barriers
                            to international trade and investment. The recent US initiative towards
                            establishing a high-level trade group in <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"
                                >OECD</gloss> is an important step in this direction.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">PRO:</p>
                        <p>1. The problems of the US balance of payments and international
                            competition are problems we have with the rest of the world in general
                                <pb n="245" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_245"/>and not with Japan in
                            particular. If we have a balance-of-payments deficit, it matters little
                            to us who has the surplus (and may be better for it to be Japan than
                            some other countries). As far as our industries suffering from foreign
                            competition are concerned, it matters little whether the competition is
                            Japanese or Zambian. Approaching such problems multilaterally reduces
                            the danger that we solve the Japanese problem without solving the US
                            problem. That is, it reduces the danger of cutting the Japanese surplus
                            by means which might increase the European surplus, or cutting Japanese
                            competition by means which might increase European competition.</p>
                        <p>2. Insofar as Japanese restrictionism is extraordinary, even-handed
                            insistence on equal treatment all over would call for major
                            liberalization by Japan.</p>
                        <p>3. A non-discriminatory approach would be least irritating to our
                            political relations with Japan and easiest for the Japanese government
                            to cooperate with.</p>
                        <p>4. A non-discriminatory approach would avoid fanning anti-Japanese
                            attitudes in the US which give rise to demands and expectations that are
                            impossible or undesirable to meet.</p>
                        <p>5. A general approach to trade liberalization is most likely to help
                            reduce the adverse effects on the US of the expansion of the Common
                            Market and other regional groups.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally, working together with Japan and the other industrial
                            countries toward our common economic objectives could resolve many of
                            the current tensions among us.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONS:</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot predict how rapidly the general measures of Option 1 will
                            bring about improvement in the US trade and payments situation, or if
                            indeed they can be accomplished. Because of the urgency of the US-Japan
                            problems, these measures may operate too slowly to bring adequate relief
                            to the US balance-of-payments.</p>
                        <p>2. Japanese exports to the United States and Japan’s trade and payments
                            surpluses have grown particularly rapidly and have therefore become the
                            focus of strong protectionist pressures in the United States. We may
                            stand the best chance of neutralizing these pressures by taking action
                            directly against the phenomena which caused them.</p>
                        <p>3. The political heat produced by the present friction in US-Japan
                            relations will stimulate Congressional action if direct and forceful
                            moves are not made by the executive branch. Congressional action based
                            on the short-run interests of pressure groups could be harmful to the
                            long-run national interests of both the US and Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. Bilateral efforts to achieve improved US-Japan economic relations
                            should not be condemned as “bilateralism”. Bilateral undertak<pb n="246"
                                facs="0277" xml:id="pg_246"/>ings can make a significant
                            contribution to the solution of our overall trade and payments
                            difficulties. For example, bilateral efforts to this end with Canada and
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> are considered normal
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>Option 2. <hi rend="italic">Increase pressure on Japan, in bilateral and
                                multilateral forums, to stimulate its domestic economy (in order to
                                achieve a better international balance) and to follow
                                internationally-agreed rules on trade and investment.</hi> (This is
                            in addition to the measures of Option 1.)</p>
                        <p>A. We would use the US-Japan Cabinet talks in September for a thorough
                            discussion of the current state of both our economies with the express
                            purpose of convincing the Japanese that, as a necessary part of the
                            international adjustment process, they must take aggressive action to
                            stimulate their economy and, consequently, increase their imports while
                            moderating their exports.</p>
                        <p>B. We should also use that occasion and the Fund meeting to conduct a
                            discreet but determined campaign to achieve yen revaluation.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d84fn3">Yen revaluation is a sensitive subject and should
                                not be pressed with the Japanese, privately or publicly, until there
                                is complete agreement at the highest level that such pressure is
                                timely. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                        <p>C. Where acute political pressures require it, we should seek ad hoc
                            “voluntary” restrictions of specific exports by Japan. But this should
                            be used only in very exceptional cases and should be applied for a
                            clearly limited period of time.</p>
                        <p>D. We should also assert our legal rights to better Japanese behavior. In
                            particular:</p>
                        <p>1. Seek authorization under Article XXIII of <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss> to retaliate against Japan’s exports to the United
                            States unless Japan removes its remaining illegal quotas on items of
                            trade interest to us (such as, but not limited to, computers and light
                            aircraft) by October 1, 1971. (In accordance with <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> rules, the proposed retaliation
                            under Article XXIII could be discriminatory and could exceed the injury
                            we complain of.)</p>
                        <p>2. Press Japan to abandon its import licensing system and, if necessary,
                            take it to <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> as a violation of the
                            rules.</p>
                        <p>3. Pursue every case where we find non-tariff measures used to restrict
                            imports or stimulate exports. (Our laws on dumping and foreign subsidies
                            can meet some of the problems in this area.)</p>
                        <p>4. Continue to press the Japanese to ease their investment restrictions.
                            (But we must recognize that the financial structure of the Japanese
                            industry and the present under-valuation of the yen put limits on the
                            extent to which Japan will allow foreign “takeovers” of existing
                            investment in contrast to new investment.)</p>
                        <p><pb n="247" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_247"/>E. We should encourage Japan
                            with its large and growing international surplus, to import more, by
                            reducing import duties, lowering some of its commodity taxes,
                            liberalizing its agricultural policies, overcoming its present economic
                            slow-down and generally raising consumption levels at home.</p>
                        <p>F. We should also use the Cabinet-level discussions in September to reach
                            agreement with the Japanese on a common view not only of the
                            international adjustment process but also on appropriate aid policy for
                            a major industrial power. More specifically, we should press Japan to
                            live up to its one percent aid commitment and to soften substantially
                            the terms on which it extends aid to less developed countries.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">PRO:</p>
                        <p>1. Continued pressure, diplomatically applied, has gotten results,
                            especially in the last 2 to 3 years. The possibilities for further
                            progress at this time seem very good.</p>
                        <p>2. These measures would not discriminate against Japan. It is now a
                            full-fledged power, no different from the United Kingdom or Germany,
                            with sensitivities at least as acute as those of other great powers. We
                            must treat Japan as we treat the other powers.</p>
                        <p>3. These measures envisage the use of all the legal instruments at our
                            disposal to protect our interests. The retaliation under Article XXIII
                            which we propose is a powerful sanction, virtually unprecedented, but it
                            is a legitimate one provided for in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>. In June, the Secretary of State gave Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> a note warning him that
                            we intended to invoke this <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            article.</p>
                        <p>4. Use of fairly conventional instruments for asserting our rights need
                            no special justification or legislation.</p>
                        <p>5. Even a modest revaluation of the yen might have an important impact on
                            the Japanese trade surplus. (Specifically, the staff of the Federal
                            Reserve estimates that a 7½ percent revaluation would cut Japan’s
                            overall trade surplus by about $2 billion and would improve the US trade
                            balance by roughly $750 million.) Yen revaluation is probably the single
                            most effective way of dealing with the balance-of-payments problem.</p>
                        <p>6. By relying on diplomatic pressure, international opinion,
                            internationally accepted rights and procedures, and Japanese
                            self-interest, we would not stimulate a nationalistic counter-response
                            by Japan nor impair our political-security relations.</p>

                        <p>1. This option does not establish any quantitative targets for our

                        <p><pb n="248" facs="0279" xml:id="pg_248"/>2. Option 2 may not satisfy
                            domestic pressures in the US.</p>
                        <p>3. Actions to date by Japan provide no assurance that the US can rely
                            solely on this option to achieve its objectives.</p>
                        <p>4. Yen revaluation should not be stressed until all significant import
                            restrictions have been removed, or unless the revaluation is part of a
                            package which includes the removal of import restrictions. Moreover,
                            revaluation could slow Japanese trade liberalization. Therefore, the
                            effects of yen revaluation cannot accurately be estimated.</p>
                        <p>5. Easing of Japan’s restrictions on inward investment would increase
                            Japan’s balance-of-payments surplus, might be used by Japan to avoid

                        <p>H. Seek to work out with Japan an arrangement, including an “early

                            commodities to the United States do not expand at such a rate as to

                        <p>1. By providing that a central negotiating strategy be developed under
                                <gloss target="#t_CIEP_1">CIEP</gloss>, the option furnishes the
                            best forum under present circumstances for coordinating the planning of
                            US foreign economic policy toward Japan. The <gloss target="#t_CIEP_1"
                                >CIEP</gloss> was formed to provide a clear top-level focus for the

                            investment, balance of payments, and finance. The responsibility for
                            central direction from the White House of the complex task of <pb

                            with Japan fits ideally into the designated role of the <gloss

                            standpoints.</p>
                        <p>2. Option 3 provides for a specific bilateral trade and payments target
                            for Japan and the timing for its achievement. Some agencies believe that
                            the absence of such specific targets in the past has contributed to
                            Japan’s ability to make vague policy statements to liberalize but in
                            fact to move at its own deliberate pace.</p>
                        <p>3. The early warning system of this option corresponds in purpose to the
                            special safeguard mechanism which the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>
                            is currently attempting to negotiate with Japan. This <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> mechanism would replace the national
                            measures maintained by the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> member
                            countries regarding sensitive imports from Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. The time seems ripe for some arrangement with Japan to guard against
                            undue expansion of exports to the U.S. of particular Japanese products.
                            The Keidanren (Japanese Federation of Economic Organizations), for
                            example, is urging that “each industry establish a watch-dog committee
                            to guard against export increases which have an undue impact on markets
                            overseas.</p>
                        <p>5. The approach of Option 3 is needed now if the pressures building in US
                            business, labor and agricultural circles as well as in Congress for
                            harsh unilateral measures aimed at Japan are to be defused.</p>
                        <p>6. Prompt and decisive action by the US Government is needed to redress
                            the overall US payments imbalance to which Japan is a major contributing
                            factor.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CON:</p>
                        <p>1. We have never asked another country to achieve a balance in its
                            economic relations with us. We have never asked another country to limit
                            exports of a number of products to us.</p>
                        <p>2. The target outlined in 3 could not be negotiated. The Japanese
                            Government could not respond constructively to demands which would be
                            interpreted by the Japanese public as discriminatory. The present
                            Japanese Government is already under heavy attack from within the ruling
                            party and from the opposition on issues—China policy and the Okinawa
                            agreement—directly involved with the US relationship.</p>
                        <p>3. Although we must press our legitimate demands, doing so in a way which
                            could be interpreted as singling out Japan for uniquely unfavorable
                            treatment could severely strain our general relations with Japan. This
                            could turn a healthy, cooperative relationship into a hostile one.</p>
                        <p>4. No market economy could “ensure” any given balance-of-payments with
                            another market economy—especially with one as large and <pb n="250"
                                facs="0281" xml:id="pg_250"/>dynamic as ours. Moreover, even if
                            Japan were to eliminate its surplus with the US, there is doubt about
                            how much the overall US balance-of-payments would improve. (For example,
                            if Japan were to reduce its exports of automobiles to the US, Americans
                            might switch to buying small cars from Europe.)</p>
                        <p>5. A bilateral approach would be a long step back to a barter world
                            economic system and would establish a precedent which might be used
                            against us by others; for example, by Western Europe which now has a $3
                            billion deficit in its trade with us.</p>
                        <p>6. The attempt to require Japan alone to achieve a balance-of-payments
                            target vis-à-vis the US without a new direct reciprocal commitment by
                            the US would have adverse consequences for our political and security
                            interests. Moreover, such costs would be incurred for the sake of
                            economic gains which have not been shown to be significant and which
                            some believe to be negative.</p>
                        <p>7. Under Option 3 H, “voluntary” controls would become the rule rather
                            than the exception in our trade with Japan, discriminating against
                            Japan. It would set aside the “escape clause” which requires that the
                            American industry seeking protection demonstrate that it is being
                            injured by imports. It would strengthen the role of cartels in Japan and
                            increase government intervention in the detailed control of the economy.
                            Option 3 H could set a precedent which could ultimately be used against
                            us.</p>
                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>’s Undersecretaries’ Committee
                            would be the most appropriate forum to work out and coordinate a
                            “negotiating plan” for Japan, particularly given its high political
                            impact.</p>

                        <p>In my letter to you of July 16<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2"><ref
                                    target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note> I discussed some of the
                            elements which were involved in recent developments between the United
                            States and the People’s Republic of China. I also expressed my profound
                            regret concerning the manner in which we found it necessary to announce
                            my invitation to visit Peking. Now, in keeping with the desire I
                            expressed in that same letter to keep in close touch with you on China
                            policy, let me take this opportunity to pass along some additional
                            thoughts concerning my acceptance of the Chinese invitation.</p>
                        <p>First, you will recall that very early in my Administration I laid down a
                            general policy objective of broadening communications between the
                            American and Chinese peoples. Last December I set the normalization of
                            Sino-American relations as my ultimate goal<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3"
                                >At a December 10, 1970, press conference <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> said, “Looking long toward
                                the future, we must have some communication and eventually relations
                                with Communist China.” Full text is in <hi rend="italic">Public
                                    Papers: Nixon, 1970,</hi> p. 1110.</note> and earlier this year
                            I remarked that I would like to be able to visit China at some suitable
                            time, either as President or in a private capacity.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d85fn4">At an April 29, 1971, press conference <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> commented, “I hope, and, as
                                a matter of fact, I expect, to visit Mainland China sometime in some
                                capacity—I don’t know what capacity.” Full text is ibid., <hi
                                    rend="italic">1971,</hi> p. 594.</note> Therefore, what I am now
                            planning represents the continuation of an existing policy and is not a
                            new departure, despite the suddenness with which the Peking trip was
                            announced. Circumstances have simply developed in a way that makes it
                            possible for this visit to take place much earlier than I had originally
                            anticipated.</p>
                        <p>I want you to know, too, that in travelling to Peking I am not assuming
                            that the many important differences between the United States and the
                            People’s Republic of China have been swept away. These remain and we
                            still must deal with them. It is my profound hope, however, that this
                            journey will make a contribution to peace, not only in Asia but
                            throughout the world, and it is in this spirit that I will go to
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, you may be sure that this visit is not directed against any
                            other country. There are too many dangers in the world to permit any <pb
                                n="252" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_252"/>such exercise of power
                            politics. I regard any easing of the tensions between the United States
                            and the People’s Republic of China as being in the best interest of all
                            countries which, for geographical or other reasons, have a significant
                            interest in the People’s Republic of China and its role in world
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, you have my deepest assurance that my visit to China
                            will not be at the expense of old friends. We will, for example,
                            maintain our commitment to the Republic of China. At the same time, the
                            preservation and strengthening of my country’s relations with yours
                            continues to be one of our foremost goals. The United States and Japan
                            have fundamental common interests concerning the stability of peace in
                            Asia and the world as well as in the economic sphere. I most sincerely
                            welcome your views and suggestions as to how we might strengthen our
                            ties in these areas, in addition to your thoughts on my trip to Peking.
                            Meanwhile, we will be consulting closely with you as to how we should
                            deal with the Chinese representation question at this fall’s session of
                            the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>May I take this opportunity to reassure you of the high value I attach to
                            our personal relationship, and to express the hope that our efforts to
                            maintain a close personal understanding will help us in meeting the
                            momentous challenges which both our countries face.</p>

                                summarized the report for <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>, noting that Beach “believes that the
                                textile negotiations are very near collapse. Hong Kong, Korea and
                                Taiwan are not likely to come to an acceptable agreement without
                                Japan.” He continued, “Japan had previously seemed willing to
                                negotiate, but the U.S. China announcement so shocked the Sato
                                government, that it is no longer willing to seek compromises. In
                                addition, Japan now sees for itself a role as a protector of the
                                smaller countries, which it can fill better if it does not help the
                                U.S. to force agreements on them.” Johnston added, “<persName
                                    corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> is by now feeling
                                desperate” and advocates citing national security concerns to
                                justify imposing limits on textile imports. (Ibid.) On July 31,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> submitted to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> a report of his
                                July 24 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>,
                                which <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> forwarded to
                                the President. (Ibid., White House Special Files, Staff Member and

                            toward China was being seized upon by the Japanese as a reason for
                            taking no further action. <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> further believes that without agreement with the
                            Japanese it will be very difficult to win agreement with South Korea,
                            Taiwan, or Hong Kong. The textile industry agrees. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName>’s presence in Japan is now
                            becoming a serious embarrassment, and he plans to leave this Saturday.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> has recommended that
                            we postpone the September US-Japan Ministerial Meeting, but most of the
                            rest of us think this would not be wise in view of your personal
                            invitation to dinner at the White House, and delicate stage of the
                            relationship vis-à-vis the China situation. If you disagree with us, I
                            would of course want to know.</p>
                        <p>It is now a matter of some urgency to determine what action should be
                            taken next with respect to this textile issue. When it becomes generally
                            known here that this latest effort has failed, as it shortly will, <pb
                                n="254" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_254"/>Wilbur Mills can be expected to
                            step in. He has already asked to see one of the top textile industry
                            leaders who has just returned from advising our textile delegation in
                            the Far East.</p>
                        <p>The Democratic textile industry leader has told me that if we don’t get
                            agreement, he will recommend the industry work with Mills. Mills
                            probably will point out that you failed to line up the three smaller
                            countries after he had paved the way with the Japanese voluntary
                            industry agreement. It is expected that Mills will take the leadership
                            on this issue, which of course is very closely linked with the whole
                            jobs issue. The most likely approach is that he try to line up a
                            voluntary agreement, similar to the Japanese agreement, with the three
                            smaller Far Eastern countries, monitor it, and if the results are not
                            satisfactory (or if he fails to get a voluntary agreement), the industry
                            reports he has told them he will support a broad quota bill, which would
                            include textiles, next spring.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it becomes urgent to determine our course of action. I have been

                                attached draft paper laid out three options for the President:
                                first, announce that textiles will be on the agenda of the
                                ministerial meetings to be held in Washington with the Japanese in
                                September; second, ask Congress for a textile-only quotas bill; and
                                third, impose quotas on textile imports under Section 232 of the
                                Trade Expansion Act. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"

                            are any economic issues important enough to override our political and

                        <p>There are two aspects to the paper. The first is general political
                            orientation we want Japan to follow during the foreseeable future, say
                            during the next three to five years. What importance do we attach to
                            Japan? What do we expect will happen? Second, is a series of economic
                            issues on negotiating strategies and detailed economic policies.</p>
                        <p>I thought it would be better to start out by discussing the general
                            directions we should follow, first on the political and security issues
                            and then on the economic issues. Then we could ask Pete and his group to
                            work out specific options on negotiating steps and on policies for the
                            economic issues. When this has been done, we can come back here and meld

                                >NSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I don’t think we should discuss such things as revaluation of the yen at
                            this meeting. Instead we should discuss the economic issues in <pb
                                n="257" facs="0288" xml:id="pg_257"/>general terms. We should talk
                            about the price we might be willing to pay on the political and security
                            issues to bring about the situation we want. If everyone is agreeable, I
                            think we should proceed in this way.</p>
                        <p>Everyone was agreed.</p>
                        <p>(to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) Alex, what do
                            you think?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I agree with you.
                            But I want to stress the time element. We have the Econ Com coming up in
                            September, and I think it is desirable and important to have an <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> session on the range of issues likely
                            to come up at Econ Com meeting. We should give the Japanese some
                            indication of the approach we are going to take.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can have this
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting the first week in
                            September.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s a bit on the
                            late side. The Econ Com is of major importance to both countries. It’s
                            important that we give the Japanese as much time as possible to prepare
                            for it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: When is the
                            meeting?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It’s September 9–10.
                            We are preparing for it now. We drafted some position papers and held an
                            inter-agency meeting. Work has been assigned. Of course, many of the
                            issues we discuss today will also surface in the other papers. We need
                            to focus on these issues, and we need to have an <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting in ample time before the Econ
                            Com meeting.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is essential
                            that the President not be asked to make individual decisions without a
                            basic strategy. The President is gone for the weekend. Let me check
                            around. Let’s see if we can’t come up by Monday<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d87fn4">August 9.</note> with a suitable time for the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting. I think our relationship with
                            Japan is crucial enough for us to make a special effort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It is very
                            important—and there is such a wide divergence of views.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly. We could
                            do one of two things. We could move this general discussion into the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> right away, or we could wait
                            until we have the more detailed papers and options before we go into the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. I will talk to the President
                            about this. I think he should hear the general arguments soon so that he
                            can get them fixed in his mind. This is especially important now because
                            of our initiative with China.</p>
                        <p>We’re going to be asking the Japanese to consider new directions which we
                            have been telling them about in the abstract for several years now. If
                            we let the situation drift, it could have serious consequences. Many
                            countries in Asia will wonder what these new directions mean, <pb
                                n="258" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_258"/>and Japan is a test-case for
                            the non-Communist part of Asia. For these reasons, we are concerned
                            about the situation.</p>
                        <p>Let me turn first to the general political problems. After reading the
                            papers, I had the impression that there is such a fear of the
                            possibility of reconsidering our policies toward Japan that there is
                            great pressure to strengthen the existing relationship. I don’t want to
                            challenge that, but I do want to pose a couple of questions.</p>
                        <p>First, do we want the Japanese to depend entirely on us, even if we chose
                            Option 1? Or should we also consider what the U.S. policy would be if
                            Japan, over the next five years, takes a more autonomous stance? Do we
                            want Japan to take a more autonomous stance? I am no expert on Japan,
                            but I thought that, with or without China and considering the economic
                            potential of Japan, we should look at whether this will happen anyway.
                            Is this one reality we should plan for? Alex?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: In the natural
                            course of events, Japan will take a more autonomous stance. At the same
                            time, Japan will continue to feel dependent on us for the nuclear
                            umbrella and will be anxious to preserve the relationship with us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When De Gaulle was
                            in power, he was convinced that he was protected by our nuclear
                            umbrella, and he felt free to pursue his own course. Won’t it be the
                            same thing with the Japanese?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It’s not really the
                            same thing. The Japanese are concerned we may transfer our affections to
                            the Chinese. That’s one reason, in fact, they have reacted the way they
                            did to our China initiative. They have always had this concern.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have always said our record with the Chinese was better than
                            theirs. When I was there, they constantly told me their great fear was
                            that we would make a deal with China at their expense. I probed to find
                            out what they meant by “expense,” but they had trouble defining the
                            word.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese memories of the war are fresh. They know we went to war with
                            them over China. Their memories of the 1924 Exclusion Act, of the
                            freezing of their assets and of other discriminatory measures are still
                            fresh. They recognize the gulf that separates us. There is real concern,
                            perhaps in an irrational way, that we will put them aside in favor of
                            the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do they think
                            we will do this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: They can’t
                            articulate it very clearly.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We went through
                            the same thing with the Germans after the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right. The
                            Japanese, as you know, founded their post-war policy on a relationship
                            with the United States. I don’t think they can or would turn to
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p><pb n="259" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_259"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: Why not?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Basically because of
                            the historical animosity.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On the Japanese
                            side?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: On both sides. You
                            have to consider such things as the Russo-Japanese War, the Soviet
                            betrayal of Japan and the Kurile Islands. If Japan were to turn to
                            Moscow now, the Soviets would have to give back the Kurile Islands, but
                            they can’t afford to do this because it would open up their eastern
                            frontiers. Another important reason Japan is not likely to turn to
                            Moscow is that the Soviets don’t furnish raw materials or markets for
                            the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>I don’t see a Japan-China axis developing, either. I do see, however, a
                            neutral Japan—a Japan taking an independent position. If, for example,
                            they lost confidence in our nuclear umbrella, they could renounce the
                            Security Treaty in order to avoid domestic problems. This could be
                            tempting for them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: As the Chinese
                            develop their missiles and as we back out of the area, there could be
                            great pressure on Japan to do this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Why can’t we make a
                            case for Japan to develop her own nuclear capability?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: They think this is
                            unnecessary as long as we provide the nuclear umbrella.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right. Japan
                            can be a maverick, and the pendulum can swing wildly from one extreme to
                            the other. We are afraid we might get the Japanese to move too much.</p>
                        <p>The history of the 1930’s may not repeat itself, but we can draw some
                            lessons from it. The troubles with Japan grew out of economic issues.
                            The extreme militarism and nationalism fed on the strong impulses for
                            lebensraum and markets. It’s possible that extreme nationalism could
                            assert itself once again over real or imagined economic issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: I agree with you,
                            Alex. If we took an extreme position and cut out their markets, we could
                            force them to develop this extreme nationalism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I don’t want to go
                            into the specific economic issues now. I think the basic issue is
                            whether we discriminate against the Japanese. This could mean that we
                            pick Japan out for different treatment than we give other countries, or
                            it could mean that the Japanese feel we pick them out for different
                            treatment. That is the basic political issue. There are a lot of things
                            we can do on the economic side, however, which will not get us to that
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese are an emotional people, not that we are not. The pendulum
                            can swing wildly. The picture of a Japanese officer cutting off the head
                            of a prisoner and then weeping fifteen minutes later at the sight of
                            cherry blossoms is perfectly credible.</p>
                        <p><pb n="260" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_260"/>When they were isolated, they
                            were very isolated. In 1868 when they decided to modernize, they
                            modernized like nobody ever did before. When they were faced with
                            certain problems in the 1930’s, they handled these problems like nobody
                            ever did before. On August 15, 1945, the pendulum swung back in the
                            other direction. It can swing again.</p>
                        <p>We do the same thing. In the 1930’s and 40’s we thought of the Japanese
                            as a stupid, little people who made toys that fell apart. During the
                            war, the Japanese were ten feet tall—evil incarnate. After the war, they
                            became polite, little people again. We thought of such things as
                            geishas.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They didn’t
                            discourage this view, did they?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: No, they didn’t.
                            Now, however, they are becoming ten feet tall again. I frankly sense a
                            growing fear here of Japan on the economic side. The Japanese are not
                            ten feet tall, and they are not three feet tall. They are about five or
                            six feet tall—and damned good competitors. I don’t think we have to fear
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: We provide a nuclear
                            umbrella for the Japanese. We also did a lot to help them build up their
                            economy. This situation has lasted two and a half decades, but we are on
                            the verge of a new era.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Many Japanese
                            understand the position they are in. They have had a closed economy. If
                            they continue with this, they know that other countries will close their
                            economies to them. The issue is whether they think it is in their
                            interest to open their economy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand the
                            analogy you were making about the Japanese situation. I want a strategy
                            that will prevent them from making these wild changes. What do we want
                            them to do in order to prevent these fluctuations? If our policy with
                            China is successful, Japan’s relations with China could also get better.
                            Japan hasn’t faced the problem of its political role in the world. Japan
                            is a country of 110 million people and an almost tribal-like society.
                            It’s becoming a dominant economic power. What are the Japanese going to
                            want to do as they become aware of the role they play? What is it we
                            have to do? What do we want them to do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Option two.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As I understand
                            it, this option means that we want them to engage in more developmental
                            assistance, but to be less exploitive. It also means that we want them
                            to be more active in the security field and that we want them to grant
                            military assistance for nonlethal items to friendly forces. We do not
                            want them, however, to play the principle role in Southeast Asia. We
                            want them to cooperate with Korea on such things as joint air defense.
                            In sum, you want us to treat Japan as a major power without nuclear
                            weapons. Am I correct?</p>
                        <p><pb n="261" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_261"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>: They should be treated in such a way that they
                            don’t feel compelled to get nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would make
                            them a major power then?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Their economic and
                            political power. Theoretically, they could even have a seat on the
                            Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: That’s a unique idea.
                            Maybe we should follow it and be a non-military great power.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a unique
                            idea. At least we would get our low defense budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: We want the Japanese
                            to play a larger role than they have been playing, but at the same time
                            we don’t want them to play too large a role.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Just for my
                            education, could you tell me how we would structure this for the
                            President? What do we want the President to focus on? Could you also
                            tell me what the Japanese would get out of this? They would continue to
                            get our nuclear protection, right?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If they think they
                            are getting this for free, there is no incentive for them to be
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: When the Chinese
                            missiles are operational, this will sober the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: They are aware of
                            this now. I called on <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> in
                            January, and the only thing he wanted to talk about was China.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I know he doesn’t
                            want to talk about textiles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: I think we have some
                            leverage with them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Henry was getting to
                            the heart of the matter a little while ago. We have to decide what we
                            want the Japanese to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: For one thing, they
                            could help in Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I may be the
                            devil’s advocate for a moment, let me say that as long as they think we
                            are taking certain actions, they will not take these actions. They must
                            be threatened that we will not support Southeast Asia and South Korea.
                            They must be convinced that their own security is involved in the
                            protection of Southeast Asia and Korea.</p>
                        <p>Once they are convinced of this, though, isn’t it possible they will find
                            themselves in the position we were in. If they feel the freedom of Japan
                            depends on Southeast Asia and if they know the U.S. won’t protect them,
                            won’t they as a last resort feel compelled to send ground forces in?
                            Then it will be a hell of a thing to keep China in line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It would be at least
                            a generation before they would deploy forces in the area—or before other
                            countries would accept deployment of Japanese forces.</p>
                        <p><pb n="262" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_262"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName>: They wouldn’t necessarily have to provide the
                            actual forces. Instead they could pay for the support of allied
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I think it would be
                            a long time before they would pay—either directly or indirectly.
                            Nevertheless, this is the direction in which I think we should try to
                            push them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we are to do
                            this, we must convince them that we might withdraw unless they help out
                            and that their help is an essential ingredient in the security of the
                            area. We could also tell them the burden will be shared, if needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We can do this first
                            and most effectively in Korea. When I was in Tokyo, I had hoped to
                            educate the Japanese about Korea, and I tried to get their feet wet on
                            providing non-lethal military assistance to the Koreans. For various
                            reasons, however, nothing ever came of this.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you mean
                            by non-lethal assistance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Such things as
                            boats, trucks and uniforms.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We define this so
                            easily in the case for Japan. Maybe this definition should apply to
                            Pakistan. As I said earlier, we have to go to the Japanese and convince
                            them their own security is involved in the protection of Southeast Asia
                            if we withdraw.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: This is especially
                            true with Taiwan because it is an area of great concern to Peking.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We must convince
                            the Japanese that regional cooperation is not an abstraction, but that
                            it is essential to their security. If they do not cooperate, they will
                            not be secure because we cannot protect them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: This will be a
                            delicate task for us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right. If
                            the word gets to the Southeast Asian countries before it gets to Japan,
                            we will have great problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Everyone already
                            sees that we are withdrawing from Vietnam. We have been pushing the
                            Japanese to provide more aid for Southeast Asia. There have been some
                            results, but the program has been marginal so far.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we get an
                            estimate of the role they should play in aiding the countries of
                            Southeast Asia? How much should they contribute? Should it be 50% or
                            75%?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: As a goal, the
                            pattern for Southeast Asia should be the mix we now have in Indonesia,
                            where the U.S., Japan and Europe each contribute a third of the funds
                            for development aid.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When I was with
                            the President in Asia, we asked the leaders we met which country posed
                            the greatest danger. To our absolute amazement, the majority said:
                            “Japan.” The Indonesian <pb n="263" facs="0294" xml:id="pg_263"
                            />Ambassador recently paid his farewell call on the President, and he
                            said that China was a long-term threat, but that Indonesia was worried
                            about Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The ANZUS Treaty is
                            really directed against Japan, too.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What incentive is
                            there for Japan to change her policies?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: More and more
                            Japanese are beginning to realize that their current policies are
                            counter-productive to their interests. It’s a small number to be sure,
                            but at least some of them realize it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: Can’t we get them to
                            do something beyond this?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have another
                            question. The basic assumption in the paper is that we should treat
                            Japan as a great power in order to keep her from developing nuclear
                            weapons. What do we think the Japanese will do? How will they use their
                            great power status?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG_1">Brown</persName>: First of all, they
                            will improve their own standard of living.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We are faced with a
                            dichotomy. We want the Japanese to do more, yet we are worried they
                            might take over Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: They have really
                            helped with Indonesia. Their aid performance there has not been bad, and
                            I think this is something we can pursue. Japan can move further if we
                            apply pressure.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What about the
                            security field? This, I presume, was one of the things Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> talked about on his
                            recent trip to Japan. (to Selden) Were you with him?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Selden: Yes, I was. The Secretary did talk about this. He stressed
                            the nuclear umbrella and modernization of the self-defense forces.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If Defense had its
                            own way, what would the security role of Japan be?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: The first thing would
                            be for them to build up their own defense capabilities. They should be
                            able to fully take over the defense of the country, including air
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would they
                            need an air defense for? As long as China has missiles, she wouldn’t
                            attack Japan with planes. We don’t want them to have an <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss>, do we?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: No, but we do want
                            them to have SAMs.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To defend against
                            what? If China attacks, she will use missiles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: In the short term,
                            this might not necessarily be the case. In any case, we also want to
                            retain our ability to operate our bases in Japan and Okinawa. And, of
                            course, we want to see increased Japanese assistance for Korea and
                            Southeast Asia so that we can reduce our load in those countries.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: We looked at this
                            last year in relation to Cambodia. If the Japanese could have given $50
                            million worth of equipment, it would have been a great help.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Didn’t they
                            contribute?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: They did, but only
                            about $4 million—mostly trucks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: We also scratched
                            around, if you remember, and tried to get communications equipment. If
                            the Japanese wanted to help in Korea right now, they could provide a lot
                            of things.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Selden: Don’t forget that they also have to modernize their own
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: That’s true, and it’s
                            related to the first point I raised about increasing their own
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a laudable
                            objective. What carrots and sticks are available to carry it out?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: Economic sanctions,
                            for one thing, are available, but they should be used very
                            carefully.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>) Do you see an indefinite need
                            for bases? Will we need bases through the next decade?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: The bases will be
                            very essential through the next decade, unless we think there is much
                            less of a threat.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you believe we
                            can continue to provide the nuclear umbrella while we are pulling our
                            forces out of the area?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The Japanese have a
                            terrible dichotomy, too. They value the nuclear umbrella. They
                            understand that our presence, including our presence on Okinawa, is a
                            guarantee. Yet they do not perceive the threat—unlike the Germans or the
                            Koreans. They do not see a threat coming from the Soviet Union—unless
                            there is a nuclear conflict involving the entire world. They do not see
                            for a generation at least a conventional threat coming from China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: This is true.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Our military
                            presence there is seen as a favor they are bestowing on us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If that is their
                            attitude, we can’t get a lot in return for our nuclear umbrella.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: As I said before, the
                            situation is changing, and they have more concern now. They had no
                            reason to worry before.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Selden: When we were in Tokyo recently,<note n="5" xml:id="d87fn5"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> visited Japan
                                July 4–11. See <ref target="#d80">Document 80</ref>.</note> Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> expressed a great
                            deal of interest in the recent developments in Peking. <pb n="265"
                                facs="0296" xml:id="pg_265"/>He wanted the Secretary to give him
                            pictures of the mounds in Peking. The Secretary went into the fact that
                            they should modernize, and he also discussed the economic crisis.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, I must say, was
                            agreeable on all counts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: The major question is
                            how do we goose the Japanese?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t question
                            the objectives. I want to know how we get there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: The Japanese must come
                            to appreciate that there is no other course open to them. They can’t go
                            with the Soviets, and the Chinese approach is out of the ball park.
                            Going nuclear is out of the question since it would scare China and the
                            neighboring countries. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                            Doctrine is inducing concern in Japan because the Japanese realize they
                            are going to have to help us. I think this is the best way we can get
                            them to deliver.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Option 1, there
                            are inducements, but no penalties. We talk about increasing joint
                            planning and joint exercises between U.S. and Japanese forces. This
                            could have consequences with our relations with China. I am not making a
                            judgment. I am suggesting that we take a closer look at our objectives
                            and options. We already analyzed the impact on Japan of our initiative
                            with China. If China should object to these joint exercises, for
                            example, there is no reason we should not have them. But we should know
                            the consequences of our actions.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: We have had joint
                            exercises during the last few years.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we get a list
                            of the categories of exercises? Then we can see which ones we might want
                            to increase. We should have the list for the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting. This is a most fluid diplomatic area, and we
                            are almost flying blind. We have to get the basic strategy set. Suppose
                            Japan does not increase her role in Southeast Asia and elsewhere as we
                            wish her to. Suppose she does not see any advantage in the economic
                            measures we would like her to take. What would we do then?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Have another <gloss
                                target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> meeting? Seriously, we must recognize
                            that our influence on Japan is marginal. We cannot determine what Japan
                            can or cannot do. We must chart the direction we would like Japan to
                            follow, but we must know we will not be fully successful. We should also
                            know we will have to modify our policies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG_1">Brown</persName>: My personal view on
                            economic sanctions is that they are more trouble for us than they are
                            for Japan. If we take the extreme step of closing our markets to them,
                            this would hurt our people severely. The Japanese could also deny us the
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: They are more
                            worried about us than we are about them.</p>
                        <p><pb n="266" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_266"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName>: I thought we were more vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG_1">Brown</persName>: They could retaliate
                            if they wanted to. For example, they could buy wheat from Australia or
                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will get to the
                            economic issues in three minutes. But first I wonder if we can get
                            something focussed for the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. Can we
                            work out the answers to the questions I raised? We should show what the
                            various alternatives look like. What would the consequences be of a more
                            independent Japan? What would we have to do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Renunciation of the
                            Security Treaty might be one result.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. And if so,
                            what would the Pacific area be like? And what effect would that have on
                            the economic situation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: May I say a word
                            about the relationship of the security and economic issues. Some people
                            compare what the Japanese have spent on defense in the last ten or
                            twenty years with what we have spent during that same period. They see
                            that we have spent ten times as much as the Japanese and that we have
                            put much less money back into our own economy. We discussed today how
                            important it is for them to spend significantly more on their defense.
                            Why is this in our interest?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We have to ask
                            ourselves several questions. First, if they do spend more, can we spend
                            less? We also have to know what we want them to spend more on. Is it
                            correct to say that a different order of magnitude of Japanese defense
                            spending would mean less defense expenditures for us? Could the Japanese
                            spending be compatible for us to reduce our spending?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: If they spend more of
                            their money for defense, it will be less favorable for the economy as a
                            whole.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is not a very
                            compelling argument to make to the Japanese. Our experience along this
                            line with the Europeans indicates that they will only spend more on
                            defense if they are convinced their own security is at stake and that we
                            will not spend more to provide their security. We know Japan’s tendency
                            to extremes. Now they are non-militarists, but if we convince them
                            otherwise, can we stop the pendulum from swinging back to the other
                            extreme?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: How important is it
                            for us that they spend more? If it is important, how can we compel them
                            to do it? If they take our nuclear umbrella for granted, why should they
                            pay for other defense measures? People do not spend their resources
                            unless there is an incentive for them to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We could compel them
                            to spend more by withdrawing entirely from Asia, by renouncing the
                            Security Treaty and by saying: “It’s up to you.” Then Tom [<persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>] would come and say that he
                            needs a much bigger navy.</p>
                        <p><pb n="267" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_267"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: That would be entirely against his [<persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>’s] instincts, too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: On the economic
                            side, I think there is agreement on what the papers say Japan should do.
                            There is disagreement, though, on how we should get Japan to do these
                            things. We all agree, for example, that the yen should be revalued. We
                            will try to get the Japanese to do this through discussions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why should they do
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: I’ll let Herb
                                [<persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Stein</persName>] answer that one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Stein</persName>: Basically, a
                            revaluation is a relatively efficient way of stopping the wasteful use
                            of their resources. Other countries have found this to be the case.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why is it
                            wasteful?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Stein</persName>: What is useless is that
                            Japan exports her real resources and gets non-earning assets—U.S.
                            dollars—in return.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: Maybe it would be
                            better to devalue the dollar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Do we feel it is in
                            the U.S. interest to permit Japan to build up U.S. resources and invest
                            them in Southeast Asia? This would help Southeast Asia move ahead. But
                            it also means that a country with capital, technology and a low cost of
                            labor would become a strong competitor for us. We must think this
                            through a little more. On the plus side, it would help Southeast Asia.
                            But on the minus side, it would create a strong competitor.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How would we stop
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: By taking action
                            which would discourage the Japanese from building up U.S. reserves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: I think the economic
                            problems are more important than the defense ones in many ways. We must
                            handle them carefully so that they don’t exacerbate the defense
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How could we
                            tackle the economic problems so that they would have no effect on the
                            defense problems? I don’t understand how this could be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName>: We can do it. If we
                            establish import quotas, however, this would be an extreme position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dam: We should approach the economic problems in more of a
                            multilateral way than a bilateral way, and we should treat Japan as a
                            great power.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How would we do
                            this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dam: One way to do it is through <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>. This would be viewed as a multilateral approach, and
                            it would not appear that we were applying discriminatory quotas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Stein</persName>: Our balance of payments
                            problem is involved with this. An across-the-board surcharge on imports
                            could be set up, for example, <pb n="268" facs="0299" xml:id="pg_268"
                            />and it would not discriminate against the Japanese. It would have an
                            equal effect on everyone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: The balance of
                            payments problem is caused in part by the Japanese. We could use an
                            across-the-board import surcharge if we start with the major assumption
                            of Japanese imbalance. [trade disequilibrium with the U.S.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Stein</persName>: I’m not starting with
                            that assumption. If we have a deficit with somebody, it’s best to have
                            it with the Japanese because they are the most docile. They are not
                            going to ask for gold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: We might get
                            retaliation from the Europeans.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have a
                            practical problem. When you use pressure, the nature of this pressure is
                            to hurt somebody—and he won’t like it. But is the price you pay for
                            this, worth it? Are there any economic objectives we must have so that
                            we are willing to antagonize the Japanese for them? We all agree we
                            should press for something. Is anything so important, though, to
                            override the political concerns we expressed before? Do you think we can
                            achieve all our economic objectives without paying a price?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: It’s unlikely the
                            Japanese will pay unless they are induced to do so as we just saw with
                            the defense issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Stein</persName>: Do we have such strong
                            economic interests that we have to give up other political and defense
                            interests? The Japanese threat against the American economy is really
                            minor and in a sense perverse. Protectionism is obviously beneficial to
                            some sectors of our economy. On balance, however, it hurts the
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Perhaps we can all
                            be together on this. This year we estimate we will have the largest
                            deficit in history on our balance of payments. This in turn will start
                            to build pressures for: a major quota bill, a pull back of troops,
                            counter-actions in Europe. We will probably have a balance of payments
                            deficit of five to six billion dollars, and a substantial part of that
                            is with Japan. Through the use of the undervalued yen the Japanese have
                            decided to sacrifice growth and to increase exports.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How much is the
                            yen undervalued? Is it ten percent?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: More. If a new
                            exchange rate were to put it in equilibrium with other systems, I think
                            the yen would be revalued 20%. This undervaluation, of course, has
                            tremendous impact on the competiveness of products in the U.S. We can
                            take action which is nondiscriminatory in some ways. We can also make
                            the case, I think, that the Japanese themselves have taken a
                            discriminatory act in undervaluing the yen. Remember, 2½ billion out of
                            the $6 billion balance of payment deficit is due to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We need to set
                            forth more elaborate political and economic frameworks so that the two
                            of them can be related together. <pb n="269" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_269"
                            />Then we can present both to the President. Can this be done by August
                            17? Can we aim for another meeting on the 17th, when we can meld this
                            together?</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIEP_1">CIEP</gloss> Review Group meeting which we
                            attended today brought out the following:</p>
                        <p>—There is disagreement amongst the agencies as to precisely what reforms
                            we wish Japan to undertake. Commerce would like Japan to allow in more
                            American private investment; however, Treasury believes this would have
                            a negative effect in the short run on our balance of payments. A number
                            of agencies are pressing Japan to revalue the yen, although the amount
                            of the revaluation acceptable to the agencies varies from Treasury’s 20
                            to 25 percent (which Japan could not possibly accept) to State and
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> believing a 7 to 10 percent
                            revaluation could be acceptable (which, if Japan liberalizes its import
                            requirements and provides more foreign aid, seems to be a more logical
                            position). Other suggested measures include a liberalization of imports
                            and voluntary restraints by Japan on her exports. However, it is obvious
                            that Japan will not do everything we seek and the agencies do not seem
                            to be able to focus on which reforms we should press hardest for at the
                            September Ministerial meeting.</p>
                        <p>—All agencies seem to agree that we have little effective leverage short
                            of the threat of quota legislation or the Administration’s imposing
                            quotas under existing legislation (which <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName> and Commerce advocate).</p>
                        <p><pb n="270" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_270"/>—There is a great deal of
                            concern with the U.S. balance of payments and trade situation in
                            general, and with Japan in particular. Last year the U.S. balance of
                            payments deficit was $3 billion and in 1971 the estimate is
                            approximately $8.5 billion, while Japan is expected to realize a balance
                            of payment surplus of approximately $7 billion in 1971. Approximately
                            $2.5 billion of the U.S. deficit will be with Japan.</p>
                        <p>—There are basically two schools of thought as to how to handle the above
                            problem: one advocates solving our balance of payments problems
                            primarily through export incentives and border taxes on imports—which
                            would not be directed specifically against Japan—but would affect trade
                            with all our partners, along with requesting Japan to conform to
                            accepted rules of international trade. The second school of thought says
                            that since Japan is quite obviously the major problem, we should exert
                            strong efforts to improve our trade and balance of payments with her and
                            avoid invoking measures which would affect trade with the Europeans.</p>

                            an international monetary system which will serve the world’s needs. It
                            was our responsibility to act and we have done so.</p>
                        <p><pb n="271" facs="0302" xml:id="pg_271"/>I am imposing a 90-day freeze on
                            wages and prices in the United States. I am cutting certain taxes to
                            stimulate consumption and employment and I am sharply curtailing US
                            Government expenditures. I am also levying a temporary surcharge on all
                            dutiable imports not already subject to quantitative limitations by the
                            United States, and I have directed that the convertibility of the dollar
                            into gold or other reserve assets be suspended. I recognize that these
                            actions will be of concern to Japan as they are vital to us.</p>

                            to get in touch with your Finance Minister to consult on how we can

                        <p>I am sure you will find that what we have done will contribute to
                            economic expansion in a world at peace. I look forward to continuing to

                                initiative, argued for a more independent Japanese foreign policy.
                                However, there are now new complications in US-Japanese relations
                                resulting from the President’s recently-announced economic

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: It is nice of
                            you to give me this time. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> sent me a cable concerning my seeing you. Is there
                            any message from you or the President that you would like me to
                            convey?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We had a surprise
                            announcement for you on July 15 and another surprise announcement on
                            August 15. I promise you there will not be another one on September
                            15.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: The last one
                            was on a Monday morning with the market already open and there was
                            confusion. I recognize Sunday evening was good for you and Europe, but
                            for us it was a delicate time.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are keeping
                            your nerve. You are buying so many dollars. I am not an economist.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: We are not
                            entirely unhappy. We are buying dollars.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am told that you
                            can force us to devalue the dollar by dumping.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S.-Japan Relations</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I talked to the
                            President yesterday. He knows you are here. We want to restore good
                            relations. We consider our friendship <pb n="273" facs="0304"
                                xml:id="pg_273"/>with Japan the keystone of our Pacific policy. We
                            have had some unfortunate misunderstandings and difficulties. We must
                            make sure that our basic traditions are not affected. One reads reports
                            about our replacing Japan with China—this is an absurd proposition. The
                            Chinese are opponents, though maybe with our policy we can make them a
                            little less aggressive. But you are our friends. We will not trade our
                            friends for opponents. Therefore as regards the basic direction of our
                            policy, nothing has changed. I explained our China moves to you.</p>
                        <p>I assume that what I say is not reported by your press officer.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I will send it
                            immediately to the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is one thing
                            I find that is not working too well in our relations. On textiles, for
                            example, there was a price paid out of proportion to the intrinsic
                            value. I was partly to blame. I did not take this issue seriously when I
                            first came into office and hoped it would go away.</p>
                        <p>We have had discussions on such matters as textiles and yen devaluation.
                            But we don’t really have fundamental discussions on where we both want
                            to go. Who should we talk to if the President wants to talk, knowing
                            that the conversations with the Prime Minister will be kept in that
                            channel. For example, if there were developments we could tell you or
                            some other designate about, something personal for the Prime Minister,
                            and you would not tell the bureaucracy and we would not tell the
                                bureaucracy.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">This paragraph and the

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We could feel
                            freer to discuss basic philosophy or approaches.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I am
                            designated.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am delighted. It
                            is up to the Prime Minister to designate. I believe we should have that
                            exchange because right now there is almost no such contact; everything
                            is more bureaucratic.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: It is done in a
                            more normal way.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not being
                            critical.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I understand
                            the reasons for what you say. I will tell the Prime Minister that it is
                            very important to have a direct channel.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are prepared to
                            work seriously to improve our relations. I don’t know where the textile
                            negotiations stand; they bore me. I have no specific proposals to make.
                            Can we settle this in the next two to three months?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I am in a
                            similar position. I have been given no information by the government on
                            the Kennedy negotiations with the Trade Minister and the Prime Minister.
                            I gather Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName>
                            still insisted on a formulation along the lines that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName> proposed to me in December of
                            last year. This makes negotiations almost impossible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With election year
                            coming certainly the President will do something. Unfortunately the
                            textile industry only concerns a few states. It would be better if it
                            were spread over the country. I do not want to get into this. With Japan
                            we always talk textiles instead of the direction of the next ten years.
                            I was very naive at the outset. In the first month of the Administration
                            there was a proposal that a mission go to Japan on textiles. I said we
                            could not open our relations with Japan on an issue like textiles. Now
                            here we are. I leave it to people who understand this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: The pattern of
                            our exports has changed radically. The bulk of our exports is in yarns,
                            raw material which the textile people buy. It is a mistake to treat
                            Japan on the same level as Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are moving and
                            your side should recognize that the Japanese Government should show
                            minimum progress. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> will raise this with your Foreign Minister on a
                            private basis when he comes. There will be no experts present.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Let us put this
                            aside.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will try to be
                            constructive. You should try to be constructive. If I never hear about
                            this again I will be only too happy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I hope you will
                            be interested in the final stage.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">The

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let us forget
                            textiles and talk about the next ten years. With dramatic events let us
                            not forget the fact that U.S./Japanese friendship is a key element in
                            our foreign policy. First, it is inevitable that as you grow stronger
                            you become the object of hostility. Secondly, our relationship must be
                            redefined. Many Americans remember you from right after the war, and
                            they forget you have your own views, that you have 2,000 years of
                            history. It is a psychological adjustment we must all make. In these
                            conditions how do we harmonize our policy? You are undoubtedly a great
                            power which will pursue its own interests. We and you have to raise our
                            sights above the purely economic matters of the post-war period.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I agree. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is trying to raise
                            sights.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We read accounts
                            that the Chinese are worried about you. Maybe this is so. In any event
                            that is their problem, not ours. We are prepared, we are eager to
                            strengthen relations with you. There is much the Chinese accuse you of
                            which you don’t wish to do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Our taking over
                            Korea or Formosa is nonsense.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t have the
                            impression that you are preparing an expeditionary force.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are a major
                            industrial country and there is no avoiding that.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I can
                            understand the Chinese fear because of many generations of past policy.
                            I don’t blame them. But they should not look at the past but at the
                            Japan of today and the future. Then there will be solutions and grounds
                            for mutual understanding. For that we must try to have more contact with
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Did you see any strong views of the Chinese while you were in Peking?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They said some of
                            the things which they said to Reston,<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">James
                                Reston wrote a series of articles for the <hi rend="italic">New York

                                August. His articles of July 17 and August 4, 6, and 13 discussed
                                China’s fear of Japanese militarism.</note> but in better balance. I
                            didn’t give them as much encouragement as Reston.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Chou used the
                            interview skillfully with Reston to impress his opinions on the U.S.
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you took the
                            names out of the interview, you couldn’t tell who was speaking for which
                            side.</p>

                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Right. Most of the statements
                            that Chou made to Reston he has made now for several years, so we
                            Japanese know that way of thinking.</p>

                            things to Japanese delegations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Many times.
                            This is the first time in the American press. It must make a rather

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: The other day I
                            had a long talk with Ambassador Dobrynin. He is obviously very concerned
                            about the purpose of the President’s policy. He said that his point of
                            view was that this announcement would upset Japan and the Asian
                            countries. He wonders what would compensate for this disadvantage and
                            achieve success. What is the purpose of the President? He is obviously
                            concerned with our country.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Dobrynin tells me
                            that he thinks you are planning to link up with China and divide up
                            Siberia between the Chinese and the Japanese. Is that true? (Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> laughs.)</p>
                        <p>Please give us advance warning.</p>
                        <p>I don’t believe that anything we do in Peking will affect Japanese
                            interests. You know that American interests forced us to try to get
                            maneuvering room. We will not change the Taiwan policy in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. We will stick with it and fight for it.
                            As for Japan we will not go along with the proposition that you are the
                            villain in Asia. We will see if we can get a neutral posture from China
                            for Southeast Asia during the period we want to wind up the war.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: That is
                            certainly very important. You had a very successful policy containing
                            the Soviet Union and Europe. At this end (Asia) the Soviet Union is on
                            your mind?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not particularly.
                            Only in the sense that we won’t let Moscow speak for all communist
                            countries. We can’t give serious military assistance to China. We don’t
                            look at this as an anti-Soviet move.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I understand
                            that your talks on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and Berlin are

                            quite well.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: The Russians
                            have not changed their attitude since the Chinese developments?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, if anything
                            the negotiations have been accelerated.</p>
                        <p><pb n="278" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_278"/>Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: We have territorial questions
                            with the Soviet Union. I raised it with Dobrynin. He said that the
                            Soviets would give us back the Islands if it were only a question of
                            relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. The main question now is
                            that the problem with China which might raise claims on the border
                            question. They have such difficulty with China. The Chinese have
                            proposed that there be no big change in the borders but that the
                            Russians admit that the treaties which are a hundred years old are
                            unfair. They will not initiate any big change at this time. The Russians
                            believe that if they give the Islands back to Japan, China will come out
                            again with big demands on the borders. That is the difficulty on the
                            Islands.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will you alter
                            your relations with Russia?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I don’t think
                            so. The territorial question is the big obstacle. Relations in the
                            economic field will present no difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why did Dobrynin
                            talk to you? Why do you not work through the Soviet Ambassador in
                            Japan?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Because I
                            raised it. He is also an important man in the Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He is on the
                            Central Committee.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: This question
                            came up after other discussion.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I once was in
                            Moscow for a radio show involving Japanese, Americans and Russians.
                            There were one or two Japanese there. The Russians were attacking me
                            until the Japanese mentioned the Kurile Islands. Then the Soviets
                            attacked Japan and I was neutral.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: The Russians
                            are certainly using the Chinese problem for their own purposes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: We are
                            inevitably involved to some extent in this power game.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem is for
                            both sides not to let themselves be used against the other by the
                            communist countries. China wants to use the U.S. against you. The Soviet
                            Union wants to use Japan against us. This is important.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not nervous
                            about your relations with the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: It is very
                            clear historically. It is not only a question of territory. There are no
                            friendly feelings towards the Russians, while there is a certain deep
                            rooted friendly feeling for China.</p>

                            It is because of our schedule.</p>

                            don’t know what you do to our people. For example, former Ambassador
                            Reischauer always tells me to be nice to you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: That gives us
                            three Ambassadors. Reischauer was very effective.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not permitted
                            to forget Japan. Of course, I do not want to. I am scolded at regular
                            intervals by Reischauer.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: In the economic
                            field what kind of developments do you foresee now?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now that we have
                            made such big steps, let’s concentrate in meetings on the big issues,
                            and not on nitpicking. It would be terribly helpful symbolically if we
                            have one or two announcements which show that we are working together
                            and agreeing together. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>
                            will talk with you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Yes. We will
                            give you some concrete ideas.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That will be very
                            helpful. We will be constructive on our side.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> said yesterday that
                            the prospects for Okinawa were better. The State Department will submit
                            this to the Senate right after the Ministerial Meeting with strong
                            recommendations by the President. That will be very helpful.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We certainly plan
                            to do that in September. Your moves would help.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Do you plan to
                            go overseas before China? Why don’t you visit us sometime?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In principle I
                            would be glad to visit Japan. In Washington whenever I go abroad
                            officially it generates a great deal of <pb n="280" facs="0311"
                                xml:id="pg_280"/>jealousy. If there could be some excuse, if I could
                            speak to some group, not the press, in principle I would be glad to
                            visit. In fact I am quite eager to do so. I have not really been there
                            since 1962 when I was there for about a week. In principle I would like
                            to go. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> invited me. I
                            can’t go as the guest of the Defense Minister; that would be under the
                            wrong auspices.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: We can find
                            better auspices I am sure.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you can find a
                            better way, particularly one that would not trigger my colleagues’
                                resentment,<note n="12" xml:id="d90fn12">The sanitized version does
                                not contain this subordinate clause.</note> that would be helpful. I
                            have thought of going. How long would it take?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: About twelve
                            hours altogether.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I went, I would
                            go by military plane.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: The polar route
                            is much shorter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe I could go

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: He was
                            determined to finish this business. After returning to Japan the
                            situation became even worse.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There have been
                            more Japanese emissaries than American secret envoys. You have seen your
                            share of Americans. We are showing you some even rougher than Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM_1">Stans</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Some people on
                            your side are bitter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The biggest price
                            you paid was with the President. It was a mistake for the Prime Minister
                            to raise the issue a second time without knowing he could settle it. The
                            first time with the President it was OK. We didn’t want to raise the
                            issue again. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> also
                            promised.</p>
                        <p>The President considers we are friends. You paid an intangible price. I
                            would like to think our basic policy is not affected by irritations and
                            it is not, but these little things are damaging.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Yes they are
                            very unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to be
                            sensible and now find a way to deal with fundamental problems. You
                            certainly have great good will in the White House. Both the President
                            and I want to strengthen our relations with Japan. The President will
                            travel all night to spend one hour with the Emperor. This symbolizes our
                            attitude. The President has a bed in Air Force One, but the rest of us
                            will be very tired.</p>
                        <p>(There was then some small talk on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s travel arrangements to the airport to go back
                            to Japan.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: How did you
                            find Prime Minister Chou?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He was very
                            intelligent.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: He expresses
                            his views in a very subtle way.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Much subtler than
                            the Russians. He is quite tough. He is very eloquent in his expressions.
                            Have you dealt with the Chinese before?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: In very small
                            ways. I have talked to some Chinese in Taiwan. They are all very
                            cultured people.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: A lack of
                            intelligence is not their national problem.</p>
                        <p>He is very intelligent. Most press speculation (on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> trip to Peking) is quite
                            wrong. They all assume there was some deal. You have experience and know
                            this can’t happen. What deals are possible?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: They are so
                            fundamental issues, for which you must have time to solve.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have managed to
                            talk about textiles for two years. Why would we solve Taiwan in ten
                            hours?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: It seems now
                            that the attitude of Taiwan is very flexible on the <gloss

                                >Kissinger</persName>: We have a very good position.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: If we fail in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, what will happen?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you
                            mean?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Will you
                            recognize Peking?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. It will not
                            affect the basic relations. We will not recognize Peking for the
                            foreseeable future. I can’t say what will happen in three or four years.
                            We have no intention now. In the future as far as I can see we have no
                            intention of recognizing Peking.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Will both you
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> be
                            going?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To Anchorage,
                            yes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I mean
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: There will be a
                            lot of press people.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We don’t know what
                            to do, but I hope there will not be too many. We could take 2,000;
                            several hundred want to go. We will try to keep the circus to the
                            minimum. They will have nothing to do there. We can’t tell them what we
                            discuss in the meetings. The Chinese have had many barbarian invasions.
                            They have never seen American journalists, not to speak about the
                            advance men. People have wondered whether something political might
                            interrupt the trip. That part is alright. What will interfere is the
                            behavior of our people.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: You are very
                            security minded.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If 750,000,000
                            people attack us, there is no way to stop them. I think the security
                            will be very good.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I think so.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If it happens it
                            will be by design not by accident. If it is by design, no one can help
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: You foresee no
                            political difficulties?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. We would not
                            have agreed to the trip. They have their own reasons. They do not do us
                            a favor.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: Of course.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are not in
                            the business of doing favors for others.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: They will
                            continue to be very tough on Japan in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will not
                            cooperate in that. If you were to expand militarily . . . but this is
                            not at all likely.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>: I can assure
                            you that this is out of the question.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can conceive of
                            no difference of views between us. We won’t cooperate in isolating you.
                            We want to strengthen our relations with you.</p>

                            should talk about the general political framework. Then we should talk
                            about the economic issues, but in more detail than we did last time<note

                            you can begin the discussion by telling us where Japan is heading, so we
                            can see if we agree on <pb n="285" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_285"/>that.
                            Then we can try to see if we can agree on where we want Japan to go.</p>
                        <p>We agreed last time, if I recall, that we were not eager to see Japan’s
                            economic power translated into military and political power. They are
                            sweating out September 15 [Econ Com meeting], especially after the way
                            they’ve been hit on July 15 and August 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The Econ Com meeting
                            won’t hurt them. Anyway, it’s scheduled for September 9 and 10.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) Alex, do you want to comment
                            about where we stand with Japan after the two shocks [July 15 and August
                            15]? Is there anything you want to say about the evolution of Japan?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I don’t have much
                            more to say than I had at the last meeting. Where Japan is headed and
                            where we want her to go will be largely determined by the interaction of
                            our policies. Since Yoshida’s day, all Japanese Prime Ministers have
                            followed the traditional path of having close ties with the U.S.—of
                            having “faith” in the U.S. The Japanese have depended on us for
                            leadership. There has been a gap in Japan, however, about recognizing
                            the position they have now achieved. There is an enormous dichotomy
                            there. Halaby [Najeeb] found this out when he met with some leading
                            Japanese businessmen last week in Honolulu.<note n="6" xml:id="d91fn6"

                            picture, but I couldn’t figure out whether he was playing polo or
                            golf.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The Japanese are
                            saying: “Tell us what you want us to do, but don’t apply any pressure.”
                            Even when I was in Tokyo, they would always speak that way. Now, of
                            course, the foundation of our relationship has been shaken in the last
                            couple of months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has been discredited. He has
                            always based his position on an intimate personal relationship with the
                            President, as well as an official relationship. He feels that he has
                            been let down. The Japanese I have talked to recently say that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has lost his power of leadership,
                            and they say it is time for a change.</p>
                        <p>I talk to the Japanese about taking bold moves. I talk up the Econ Com
                            meeting on September 9 and 10 as an opportunity for the Japanese to take
                            a bold, dramatic move to restore our deteriorating relationship. These
                            Japanese agree that they should do something, but they claim it is not
                            possible in their system.</p>
                        <p><pb n="286" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_286"/><persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> is a lame duck. It is a question of how much longer
                            he will stay on, and the betting is that he will be out by early 1972.
                            If the Party [<gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>] breaks up on the
                            Okinawa reversion issue, he will be out sooner.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How would the
                            Okinawa issue cause the Party to break up?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Some break-up has
                            already occurred as a result of the reversion agreement and legislation
                            which will be required to implement it. The implementing
                            legislation—some 600 bills—will be tough to get through the Diet. Two
                            bills will be particularly difficult. The first one deals with eminent
                            domain, and it means the Japanese will have to take over the property
                            needed for them to implement the base agreement. Many of our bases are
                            on private land. The second bill concerns the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                                >VOA</gloss> agreement.<note n="7" xml:id="d91fn7">The United States
                                and Japan had negotiated the post-reversion status of a Voice of
                                America Broadcasting facility on Okinawa.</note></p>
                        <p>Now that a dramatic shift is taking place in the U.S.-China relationship,
                            the Japanese feel that our bases are not needed and that they [the
                            bases] will prove to be a hindrance to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Still another reason for <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            being discredited is that Peking has said it would not do business with
                            him. It all adds up to whether <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> will turn over power to <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> [Foreign Minister], which would be good from our
                            point of view, or whether he will turn the power over to somebody less
                            tied to maintaining a close relationship with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who would that
                            be?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It could be
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>. He is not unfriendly
                            to the U.S., but he would be more independent. It could also be
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>, although this is
                            unlikely. The worst would be <persName corresp="#p_MT_1"
                            >Miki</persName>, who was Foreign Minister when I was there. He is very
                            difficult to deal with.</p>
                        <p>In brief, the problem now is what degree of independence they will take,
                            and this will be determined in large part by the interaction of our
                            policy. A more independent Japan is probable. We have to be reconciled
                            to it. They will be looking very closely to see if we are discriminating
                            against them, to see if we are following a punitive policy instead of
                            maintaining the close ties. If we take steps which they think are
                            punitive, it will have an effect on our relations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This has been very
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I am not saying we
                            should not take steps which we think are wise.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We should take
                            into account the price we will have to pay if we take measures which the
                            Japanese regard as punitive.</p>
                        <p><pb n="287" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_287"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>: Our action of August 15 did not discriminate
                            against Japan. We imposed across-the-board measures. Yet Japan thought
                            we had hit her hard. The Japanese now want to take action in a
                            multilateral framework. To the degree that we can, we will be better off
                            by doing so. This is not to say, though, that we should not deal
                            bilaterally with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Chirep is still another issue that’s tearing the Party apart. They are in
                            anguish—and their position has not been made clear. They are very
                            concerned about being associated with the U.S. in a losing venture at
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. If our resolution fails, it will
                            be bearable here. In Japan, however, it will be another indication of
                            Japan following a U.S. policy that is defeated. The <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> is split on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is the Party in
                            favor of the Albanian resolution?<note n="8" xml:id="d91fn8">The United

                                (Taiwan).</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Various elements
                            favor the Albanian resolution, but the Party as a whole does not support
                            it. One element in the Party feels a sentimental attachment to Taiwan.
                            This arises from a feeling of obligation and appreciation for the way
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang</persName> treated the Japanese
                            forces after the war.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I think that over
                            one million men were returned to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right. The
                            Japanese were well-treated by <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s forces, and there were no reparations,
                            either.</p>
                        <p>Other elements in the Party want relations with Peking, regardless of the
                            cost to Taiwan. These are strong issues: the Japanese are in a state of
                            flux and great debate.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You agree, then,
                            that under any hypothesis, Japan will be more autonomous. How will the
                            Japanese express this autonomy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: For one thing, there
                            will be less association with the U.S. in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> on the Chirep issue. On the military side, I would not
                            expect any immediate reaction. A more autonomous, independent Japan,
                            over a period of time, will create some difficulties, however, in
                            military relations. In spite of demonstrations and some anti-U.S.
                            outbursts, the Japanese Government has had good relations with us on all
                            issues. Their instinct has also been to help us in the Vietnam war. In
                            the future, they will probably be less cooperative.</p>
                        <p>With <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> or <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>, a new government would be no
                            problem for us. With <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>, the
                            situation could get to the point where our bases would be
                            vulnerable.</p>
                        <p><pb n="288" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_288"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: To what extent would our actions influence
                            the outcome?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: What we do and how
                            we do it, can to some degree help reestablish the validity or
                            credibility of the policy of close association with the U.S. This will
                            pay off, but the outcome is within certain parameters.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In any case, the
                            Japanese leadership will change next year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right,
                            possibly even this fall.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Between now and
                            next spring, when the China trip takes place or is imminent, we will
                            have to avoid jangling the Japanese nerves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. They are afraid
                            we will shift our affections from them to the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Until we go to
                            China, we will have to think of doing some ostentatious thing for the
                            Japanese. Yet we will have to follow a fine line vis-à-vis Japan. If we
                            were asked how to restore close ties with Japan, we could make a list of
                            ten things we should do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The President’s
                            visit to Anchorage is one.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. That’s
                            excellent. What about if we crank in military maneuvers, even though
                            nobody has proposed them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Japan doesn’t want
                            these maneuvers. This is part of the problem: the Japanese feel that if
                            we “make up” with China and at the same time keep our bases in Japan,
                            Chinese hostility and pressure will focus on Japan because of the U.S.
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) Tell the Japanese they need
                            not be so humble. The Chinese are ambivalent as hell.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: On the one hand, the
                            Chinese want us out of Japan. On the other hand, they want a weak Japan,
                            but they don’t say they want our presence in Japan. This is much the
                            same way the Soviets regard our presence in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a delicate
                            problem. We would be fools to exchange a long-time friend [Japan] for an
                            outright opponent. Even at best, China will not be the anchor of our
                            Pacific policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I say to the
                            Japanese that we are just trying to establish communications with the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Putting this in
                            cynical terms and leaving aside the historical ties with Japan, it’s
                            good to dangle close Japanese ties in front of the Chinese. It would be
                            crazy to throw over Japan, and it serves our Chinese policy to have
                            close ties with Japan. This should not be done, however, in a blatant
                            way because we don’t want the Chinese to feel we’re ganging up on them.
                            This is the line we should <pb n="289" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_289"
                            />generally follow. Such things as the Anchorage visit contribute to
                            this policy. (to <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) You
                            said that we would have trouble with a more autonomous Japan in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The Japanese have
                            already said that the bases are a favor to us. They perceive no sense of
                            threat, and the bases are only valued for what they bring in terms of
                            relations with us. They feel the bases are a cost they must bear in
                            order to maintain close ties with us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would happen
                            if we closed the bases?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: They [the Japanese]
                            would be scared as hell.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would not do
                            that [close the bases], even if they saw no threat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: They value the bases
                            as a hostage to the nuclear umbrella. This is the price they pay for
                            having our nuclear protection.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you mean?
                            Do they think we would use nuclear weapons if Japan were attacked?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes, if the attack
                            came from China or the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would they expect
                            a nuclear response to a conventional attack?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The Japanese do not
                            see a conventional threat. They don’t think the Chinese would launch a
                            conventional attack for at least a generation to come. Instead, they are
                            much more concerned about the Chinese nuclear threat. They are also
                            becoming more and more interested in the security of South Korea, which
                            they see as a hostile dagger pointed at Japan. They now feel South Korea
                            is vital to their security, and they value our presence there. If we
                            were to withdraw completely from South Korea and Japan, this would
                            inevitably lead to major Japanese rearmament.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Couldn’t such a
                            withdrawal also lead to a Finnish-type neutrality?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Initially, yes. In
                            the long-run, though, it would lead to rearmament.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: Wouldn’t the Japanese
                            see the threat growing as we withdraw?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. And this is
                            also part of the problem. If you recall, my argument against the
                            withdrawal of our forces from Korea was based more on the way the
                            Japanese would look at it than the way the Koreans would.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You won that
                            argument.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I think we would
                            have more latitude in the use of our Japanese bases in the event of war
                            between North and South Korea. We have had some difficulty in staging
                            forces for Vietnam, though.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We have been
                            rotating forces without trouble since 1964.</p>
                        <p><pb n="290" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_290"/>Adm. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: The paper indicates the
                            opposition is talking about creating problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We have not had
                            problems. About a million men have been moved. Take the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident, for example. When we wanted to
                            move forces, I talked to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and
                            there was no problem.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: May I be the
                            devil’s advocate for a moment? If I understand the paper, we want to
                            maintain close ties with Japan. Nobody disagrees with that. What do we
                            want Japan to do? We want Japan to: (1) continue to provide the bases
                            and facilities essential to our Pacific security posture; (2) spend more
                            for a conventional defense; (3) play a more constructive role in the
                            economic development of Southeast Asia; (4) continue to seek great power
                            status through nonmilitary means and without nuclear weapons. At the
                            same time, we say that Japan will be more autonomous, and this means
                            they will not follow us as much as they have in the past. How do the
                            Japanese perceive all of this? How do they see the role we have assigned
                            to them in the paper? What would a Japanese Prime Minister say to his
                            people to enable them to carry out this assigned role? I am not
                            objecting to these goals, if we can get them. But is it likely?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The Japanese don’t
                            have to justify any action they take in Southeast Asia to the U.S. We
                            went to war in 1941 over such actions. It’s possible that we could have
                            a bad Japan. We must recognize that the Japanese are an emotional
                            people, and the pendulum can swing between the extremes: in 1930 they
                            were militant, but in 1945 they were for complete disarmament. The
                            Japanese want to feel a sense of belonging. If they feel isolated and
                            cornered—as they did in 1930—they will strike out one way or another. In
                            Southeast Asia, any Japanese Government can justify actions on its own
                            grounds.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We want them to
                            follow an economic policy which places more emphasis on development than
                            exploitation. What incentive is there for them to follow that
                            policy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The incentive would
                            be to tie Southeast Asia closer to them. It would be a recognition that
                            a development policy is in their interest. More and more Japanese are
                            coming to realize that this type of economic policy is in their
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Southeast Asian policy, we have to be careful not to talk in
                            terms of what the U.S. wants, but in terms of their interests. Like any
                            country, Japan does what is in her own interest.</p>
                        <p>On the military side, they can justify the bases as the price they must
                            pay for our nuclear umbrella.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you saying
                            they won’t raise the questions about our nuclear umbrella that were
                            raised by the Europeans?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: No. They will raise
                            these questions eventually.</p>
                        <p><pb n="291" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_291"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName>: If I were a Japanese looking ahead at the next
                            five years, I would probably feel that America has been torn apart by
                            the Vietnam war, and I would probably think that the chances of America
                            keeping her conventional forces in Asia will be reduced. I would worry,
                            therefore, more about the conventional threat posed by other forces in
                            the area.</p>
                        <p>On the nuclear front, I would be concerned by the MRBMs and ICBMs the
                            Chinese will have by 1975.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They [the Chinese]
                            won’t have a hell of a lot.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: And they wouldn’t
                            need ICBMs to attack Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: One could argue
                            that the more the Chinese develop their nuclear capability and the more
                            we move closer to China, the more the credibility of our nuclear
                            umbrella becomes central to Japan. How do we foresee the pressures on
                            Japan to develop her own nuclear capability?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: As far as a
                            conventional attack goes, as I said before, they don’t feel the homeland
                            is threatened.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: What about
                            Southeast Asia? Wouldn’t their interests be threatened there?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Not greatly. They
                            feel they can get along with China in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What about South
                            Korea?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s a different
                            story, and so is Taiwan. In Southeast Asia, though, they feel they can
                            accommodate the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Even if the
                            Chinese take over?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. They have
                            already demonstrated their ability to do business with the Chinese. I
                            tell the Japanese who come in to see me that we are merely trying to
                            catch up to them in their dealings with the Chinese. (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>) What you said about the
                            nuclear weapons is correct. It’s a question of our maintaining a
                            relationship of sufficient confidence so that they don’t feel they have
                            to get nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Aren’t they headed
                            in the direction of getting nuclear weapons anyway?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Much less so than
                            they were a few years ago. For one thing, they will never develop a
                            credible deterrent against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                            their number one enemy. They will also have difficulty developing a
                            force to be used against the Chinese. What will impel Japan to go
                            nuclear is not fear of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or
                            China, but the need for great powers to have nuclear weapons. The desire
                            to gain admittance to the great power club will provide the strongest
                            influence to obtain nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are speculating
                            about what will motivate Japan in this regard. This reminds me of what
                            we went through with De <pb n="292" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_292"/>Gaulle.
                            We took his independent stand as a reflection on our trustworthiness. As
                            I understand it, he didn’t say that he didn’t want the U.S. protection.
                            He said that in the nuclear age, one country protected another when it
                            felt its vital interests were at stake. He thought that the United
                            States would protect Europe, and, therefore, he felt that he didn’t have
                            to pay for our nuclear umbrella. During a crisis—Cuba, for example, or
                            the 1960 summit—he always supported us. In fact, he was often better
                            than the English.</p>
                        <p>There are pressures to develop nuclear weapons in Japan. Is it out of the
                            question that the Japanese will take the position De Gaulle took?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: No, it’s not out of
                            the question. The Japanese have never had a De Gaulle—thank God. They
                            have never had a Hitler or a Napoleon. They don’t take to strong
                            leadership. I guess Prime Minister Yoshida is the closest they’ve come
                            to such a strong leader. A Japanese prime minister is more of a
                            spokesman for the consensus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: On the question of
                            credibility, we refer to Japan as our close partner in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Let’s just say we
                            have a partnership.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Okay. We cooperate.
                            Anyway, if there is a new Japanese leader, he will try to reassess what
                            we will do in a crunch, and I wonder what he will think. I don’t think
                            public opinion here will be in favor of defending Japan in a crunch. A
                            new Japanese leader would probably come to the conclusion that our
                            defending Japan in a crunch would be unlikely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It will surely go
                            through the Japanese mind, but we can only influence that type of
                            thinking in degrees. Even the way we handle the situation will have some
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) You said before that the
                            Japanese don’t perceive a threat. If that is so, why should Japan be
                            concerned about having the nuclear umbrella?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Because of the
                            nuclear allergy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: They obviously feel
                            it is important to have some kind of deterrent. If they lose faith in
                            ours, then, the pressures on them to develop their own will
                            increase.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Of course. Still,
                            their biggest concern is great power status.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: If you assume that
                            their perception of the threat changes, you also have to assume that
                            their attitude to defense costs changes. Will they share the costs of
                            maintaining U.S. forces?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s unlikely to
                            be the case during the next four or five years.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It would be foreign
                            to their thought to pay more of the cost for maintaining our forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: I sense an
                            important American attitude developing. The more competition the
                            Japanese economy provides, the more the attitude is likely to develop
                            here that Japan is getting a free ride on defense expenditures—and the
                            less palatable this will become. Is a larger share of defense costs in
                            their interest?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I’m not so sure
                            Japan is getting a free ride. We have to ask ourselves if a heavily
                            armed, nuclear Japan is in our interest. I don’t think this is
                            necessarily so.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There’s no way
                            they will increase their defense expenditures, unless we cut ours down.
                            This is not like the situation in Europe, where we can threaten to
                            reduce our ground forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: Actually, they are
                            increasing their defense spending.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The line projections
                            for the Japanese <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> are now of course
                            out the window, but we can make a rough projection. Some people want
                            them to spend 1.5 percent of the <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> on
                            defense, and, by the mid 1970’s, this will be a large figure in absolute
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The French spend
                            4.8 percent of the <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> on defense, but
                            their <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> is smaller than Japan’s.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: The Japanese, I
                            believe, are spending 0.8 percent on defense now.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Given the delicate
                            balancing act we have to perform, we need a statement of objectives
                            which are obtainable. Can we get from the <gloss target="#t_IG_1"
                                >IG</gloss> a more detailed set of things to be done during the
                            remainder of this term, during the next year and a half? We need a
                            formulation of steps which will take into account the political
                            sensitivities of the situation and which will not drive the Chinese up
                            the wall. We also need a statement from the Japanese viewpoint on the
                            “do’s” and “don’ts” we should follow in regard to our China policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We’re fortunate that
                                <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> is now the Foreign
                            Minister and that he stands a good chance of becoming Prime Minister. He
                            is the best Foreign Minister from our standpoint because we can deal
                            authoritatively with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Leaving aside the
                            Chinese considerations, can we also get a list of measures we should
                            take? What about space cooperation?</p>
                        <p><pb n="294" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_294"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>: I am the father of space cooperation with Japan
                            because the program started when I was in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Frankly, I think
                            that a space cooperation program would have only a marginal effect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I agree. We should
                            cooperate, but we should realize that this will have no great impact on
                            the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What about a
                            Security Council seat for Japan? I think this is a bad year to pursue
                            that goal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We really can’t do
                            anything to get the seat for Japan. We can tell them that we sympathize
                            with them and that we will support them, but that we can’t take any
                            initiatives. If we were to go through the exercise of taking an
                            initiative for Japan, we would end up in a thicket of brambles. When
                                <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> is here, we can talk
                            to him and try to come up with a feasible means of seeking the seat.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Even if we develop
                            a feasible means of doing so, I don’t know if this is the right year to
                            do it, considering the China visit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We’re not going to
                            develop anything. The thought of Japan getting a Security Council seat
                            would anger Peking.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it’s best
                            to duck the whole issue this year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. Nevertheless,
                            we can tell the Japanese that we support them in principle. We should
                            ask them what they think they should do to obtain the seat.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I wonder if we can

                            don’t you start the discussion while we’re waiting for <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> to rejoin us?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: It’s his paper, and he should really be the one to talk about
                            it. Let me give you a few of our impressions, though.</p>
                        <p>Japan is breathing a sigh of relief because the surcharge is
                            across-the-board and world-wide—and not directed solely against her. The
                            initial reports of the impact there on August 15 were slightly
                            exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Don’t forget that
                            the news hit them when their markets were open on Monday morning.</p>
                        <p><pb n="295" facs="0326" xml:id="pg_295"/>Mr. Petty: That’s one reason the
                            program was put together over the weekend. One point the Japanese are
                            making is that any adjustment in exchange rates should be done on a
                            multilateral basis, and we seem to be going in this direction. By
                            holding bilateral talks with Japan, we will be strengthening her
                            multilateral negotiating position.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now that the
                            Japanese are floating the yen, will it be revalued?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: Yes. It will be pushed up a little bit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can they defend
                            the yen enough to keep it from going up?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: Not for very long. Now that they have made the decision to
                            float the yen, their negotiating position vis-à-vis Europe is stronger.
                            They can be recalcitrant like the French, and not be the only country
                            holding up the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> rejoined the
                            meeting at this point.)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>) We were just beginning the
                            discussion of your paper. Would you care to make some comments on
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: I think there is
                            general agreement that the Econ Com meeting should be held in a
                            conciliatory atmosphere. As part of the exercise, we should decide how
                            forthcoming we want to be on such matters as Okinawa reversion. We
                            should stage the meeting in such a way so that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> can play it back as symbolic
                            evidence of U.S. attitudes. I think the Japanese should come away from
                            the meeting with something tangible.</p>
                        <p>I had a recent meeting with some Japanese, including Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>, and they expressed concern
                            about the communiqué that will come out at the end of the meeting. On
                            the economic-political front, there are a few issues we can’t discuss at
                            that meeting. But there are also several issues which can be brought up.
                            One of them is space cooperation. The Japanese want access to our new
                            booster technology and guidance systems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I think we can deal
                            with this issue.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Should we do for
                            the Japanese what we are doing for the Europeans in the space field?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It’s applicable, but
                            I don’t think we need to get into the subject now. We agreed to sell
                            them certain items. They want the best technology available.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do they want this
                            technology for space purposes or for short-range missiles?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: For space

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Because first-class
                            powers have space programs. Even the Chinese have a space program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Is there a
                            correlation between what they can use for space purposes and for
                            medium-range missiles?</p>

                                >Johnson</persName>: Yes. But we can deal with it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Before our
                            delegation to the Econ Com gets any guidance, does any inter-agency
                            group review this subject?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. We have an
                                <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> which considers this. There is
                            some difference of views.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can one of my boys
                            be put on this group?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: You already have
                            someone on it. I think it’s Wayne <persName corresp="#p_SKW_1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: The Japanese “wish
                            list” also includes the post-Apollo program and a medium-sized jet for
                            the commercial field. We would like to help them with the commercial
                            jet.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would they build
                            the jet?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: No. It would be a
                            joint project. They will propose it shortly.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My concern is the
                            Presidential point of view. I don’t think we should do so many things.
                            Although they all might be good individually, they might have the total
                            effect of tying us up. We should wait until the China visit is behind
                            us, and I don’t want to get into any of these areas during the next
                            three months.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Hopefully, I will
                            finally be getting off my letter to Lefevre on the post-Apollo program
                            on Monday. Last Friday Comsat voted not to sign the letter because they
                            thought I had double-crossed them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Has that been
                            straightened out?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. They finally
                            signed it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No one has ever
                            worn you out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I don’t think we
                            have a problem with the Japanese on post-Apollo. In another area, we
                            made an offer to supply them with enriched uranium, and we are prepared
                            to go ahead with it. The proposal for a medium-sized jet is new to me.
                            It seems that this is strictly a commercial project—and that we already
                            have too many types of jets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: I was talking to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> recently about
                            our offer to supply the Japanese with enriched uranium, and he mentioned
                            that the Econ Com was not the proper forum in which to discuss the
                            offer, considering its sensitive defense aspects. He has several
                            important questions about this particular proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We already made an
                            offer to begin discussions on gas diffusion plants.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But wasn’t that a
                            year ago?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It was. The Joint
                            Committee on Atomic Energy, however, only cleared the proposal six weeks
                            ago. Now the ball is in the Japanese court.</p>

                                >Kissinger</persName>: Has this been announced?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Allen: This would be a good item for the Ministerial communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: You’re right. We can
                            add it to the communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> says that he has several
                            questions to raise before we go ahead with it. I suggest that we have a
                            group take a closer look at the proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I can write one
                            paragraph for the communiqué right now. The Japanese consortium is a
                            long way down the road, and the ball is in their court. Now they have to
                            talk to the Australians and Canadians. I think we can say something
                            about it in the communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: A major issue at
                            the meeting [Econ Com] will be the balance of payments goals problem.
                            The U.S. has certain requirements for balance of payments objectives.
                            Right now we are in disequilibrium with the rest of the world, and much
                            of our deficit is due to our large defense obligations.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese are also in disequilibrium with the rest of the world. Their
                            balance of payments projections suggest that they desire a large
                            surplus. They should have a trade surplus of nearly $7 billion this
                            year. By 1975 the surplus should be about $11 billion. It is difficult
                            to reconcile balance of payments goals this far apart.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be Agency agreement to sit down with Japan and discuss
                            this problem. I think it would be desirable to discuss our mutual goals,
                            using the Econ Com meeting as a setting for this discussion.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it our goal to
                            negotiate a bilateral balancing with them at the meeting?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: No. They will
                            probably talk about multilateral steps which will have to be taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: They will keep the yen floating for a while. The first thing
                            we have to decide is what kind of world monetary system do we want to
                            have. There are three choices: (1) a floating world; (2) a fixed
                            exchange rate system; and (3) a flexible fixed exchange rate system.
                            Right now everyone is floating. The hope is that we will all reestablish
                            relatively fixed exchange rates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: We shouldn’t come out
                            for that type of system too soon because we could lose some of our
                            negotiating leverage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: We can spend all
                            afternoon discussing what kind of system we want.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The President’s
                            basic view is that he doesn’t want to patch up the old system. He wants
                            to take a good look at a new system. What this system is, I don’t
                            know.</p>
                        <p><pb n="298" facs="0329" xml:id="pg_298"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName>: It will take at least a month to examine the
                            alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: We said that we want to adopt a new system because we wanted
                            to have surpluses after fifteen or twenty years of deficits. If we have
                            surpluses, though, somebody else must have deficits. The <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> thinks the U.S. should have a relative
                            devaluation of 10 percent and that Japan, therefore, should revalue the
                            yen 15 percent.</p>
                        <p>According to our figures, we require a higher revaluation for Japan
                            because we have higher objectives for our balance of payments problem.
                            If we say that the U.S. has to have a relative devaluation of 10 or 15
                            percent, you have to ask what that means for other countries. For Japan,
                            it would mean a 17–22 percent revaluation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: If we are all
                            floating, why do we care if the Japanese buy dollars? That won’t hurt
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: We can’t assume
                            that we will stay on a floating system.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to know
                            what kind of a system we want. A floating system is one choice. In the
                            summer of 1969, we came up with some proposals which were technically
                            feasible, but which were bad politically. At that time the President
                            decided we didn’t have a chance of getting this system. We have to take
                            a careful look, therefore, at the political aspects of whatever system
                            we restructure now. (to <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                            >Peterson</persName>) We can give support to your group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Let me try to
                            summarize the arguments on the balance of payments problem.
                            Theoretically, in a free-trade world, the idea of each country achieving
                            a balance of payments equilibrium with other countries is unrealistic.
                            We want some things from some countries, and we may have a deficit with
                            them. On the other hand, we may have surpluses with countries we don’t
                            want things from. Some people feel that discussion between two countries
                            on how to achieve bilateral balance of payments equilibrium could be a
                            dangerous precedent. If we do this with Japan, they say, we might be
                            forced into doing it with Europe—where we have a surplus.</p>
                        <p>In view of these arguments, let me tell you why we want bilateral
                            balancing with Japan. First, we are in fundamental disequilibrium with
                            Japan. Our bilateral trade deficit with Japan for 1971 is going to be
                            about $2.4 billion. Second, if our overall situation is going to improve
                            as much as we think it has to, much of the improvement must come in the
                            trade account. Third, in the past, there has been a gap in Japan between
                            their rhetoric and their actions. Even if we get trade liberalization,
                            specifically, their eight-point program, we still may face the
                            possibility of a gap in their implementing actions.</p>
                        <p><pb n="299" facs="0330" xml:id="pg_299"/>In the paper, we were simply
                            trying to see what the balance of payments would be in the theoretical,
                            free world.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who would conduct
                            these negotiations?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: At the Econ Com
                            meeting, we have to tell the Japanese to put their primary emphasis on
                            multilateral goals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: We could state our multilateral objectives and then deal with
                            them [the Japanese] on a bilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Isn’t the floating
                            of the yen the first step to revaluation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: We hope so. With a
                            scenario that imagines what would happen if everything goes according to
                            the rules, the biggest factor is revaluation of the yen.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it likely that
                            the yen will just be revalued a little bit?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: Look at it this way. We need a relative improvement in our
                            trade balance of X percent from the rest of the world, and Y percent of
                            this must come from Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: But we won’t need
                            this change if we keep floating.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: You’re assuming we will stay on a floating system, but we
                            won’t.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What’s wrong with
                            a floating system? Won’t it enforce internal discipline among countries
                            with regard to their currencies?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: John [Petty] is
                            right. We need certain changes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m just trying to
                            understand what we want. We tell the Japanese that a certain percentage
                            of our deficit belongs to them. They agree, and they ask us what we want
                            them to do. Let’s assume now that they revalue, but that the revaluation
                            isn’t high enough. What do we do? Do we say that they must revalue 20
                            percent? Then they can answer with a “yes” or “no.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dam: There are certain things we want, such as liberalization of
                            trade, opening up for investments, etc. The only question is whether it
                            is best to make progress on these issues in a multilateral way or a
                            bilateral way. I do not see any advantage in the bilateral approach. In
                            fact, I see sizable dangers in that approach, and it wouldn’t make much
                            economic sense, either, because Japan could redirect her exports. There
                            could be very great implications if we take the bilateral goals
                            seriously.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: The reason Canada is afraid to change her exchange rate is
                            that if she revalues and Japan does not, she will be hurt. Our
                            multilateral objective is composed of bilateral elements. Is it wrong to
                            point that out to Japan?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dam: We can point it out, but we should not take it too
                            seriously.</p>
                        <p><pb n="300" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_300"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: Why should we even talk about it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: If our target is to
                            restructure our trade balances, then it should also be our target to
                            change the exchange rates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: We should establish new fixed exchange rates. Would you accept
                            the idea that the U.S. needs new exchange rates, at least with the
                            industrial countries?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Couldn’t we let
                            the President get a crack at this issue?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I am not sure that
                            getting new exchange rates is our objective.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: The President said in his August 15 announcement that he
                            wanted a major realignment of exchange rates.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In my experience,
                            the worst thing you can do is take a sentence out of a speech and then
                            lock it in concrete. If this is a contested point, let’s give the
                            President a crack at the issue. If he says we should stay with a
                            floating system, this won’t be an issue. If he wants a fixed exchange
                            rate, it will be an issue. And then we will have to tell the Japanese
                            how much of the deficit they must make up. Supposing they agree, can we
                            then say: “You must do the following?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: Not necessarily. The progress can be measured by the
                            liberalization they undertake.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dam: I think a major question for us is how we fix our goals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: This [zero balance] is the way we have done it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: No matter how the
                            argument comes out, we all agree that we want the yen to be
                            revalued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: We want a major
                            revaluation. As we all know, there are different degrees of floating.
                            The Japanese can float the yen a little bit, but then add controls and
                            still have a disequilibrium with us. The U.S. does not want a major
                            trade deficit with Japan for political and economic reasons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We want the yen
                            revalued; we want them to help relieve our aid problem in Southeast
                            Asia; we want them to undertake more military procurement in the U.S.;
                            we want them to implement the eight-point trade liberalization program.
                            We all agree on these things.</p>
                        <p>I just happen to have a piece of paper here which was written in the
                            Japanese Foreign Office. It contains all of these items, almost as if
                            they were lifted right out of the <gloss target="#t_CIEP_1">CIEP</gloss>
                            paper. The Japanese Foreign Ministry with <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>’s support, is fighting other elements of the
                            Government over these items. I think that what the Foreign Ministry is
                            proposing would make an excellent agenda for the Econ Com meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: What does that
                            paper say about yen revaluation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It proposes that the
                            yen be revalued 10 percent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: That’s
                            unacceptable.</p>
                        <p><pb n="301" facs="0332" xml:id="pg_301"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>: OK. But the principle for revaluation is there.
                            The program the Foreign Ministry is fighting for is what we want to
                            discuss in the Econ Com. This has <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>’s support, and I think we should pattern our
                            meeting strategy on this program—their program.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Twelve years ago
                            when I first began seeing Presidents, I went in to see Kennedy. I did a
                            good job in telling him what his problem was. Afterwards, somebody told
                            me that I should never tell a President about his problems: I should
                            give him solutions.</p>
                        <p>What do we tell Japan? Can we separate the immediate and long-term
                            issues? Would it be possible to prepare a detailed scenario for the
                            meeting?</p>
                        <p>I can detect two contradictory trends in today’s meeting. The first is
                            that we undertake so many face-saving steps that we worry China. The
                            second is that we impose so many demands that we get a “no” from
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Can we get a coherent document giving our objectives and the points we
                            propose to make? Who would be in charge of getting this paper
                            together?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We would be. I just
                            happen to have another paper here which we have prepared on this
                            subject. It doesn’t say that we want a 22 percent revaluation or a 5
                            percent revaluation. It merely sets up goals, and these goals are
                            consistent with those of the Japanese Foreign Office. Once the goals are
                            agreed upon, it would be a matter of negotiating a 10 or a 15 percent
                            revaluation. Incidentally, the Secretary has not yet seen this
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: This is where a
                            difference in degree creates a great problem. A 10 or a 15 percent
                            revaluation is absolutely fundamental to our balance of payments
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: The negotiation
                            wouldn’t be done in the Econ Com. It would be done in the Group of
                            Ten.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I want the
                            President to look at this whole issue. When he meets the Japanese at the
                            dinner, he will need the basic trend of opinion. We need a coherent
                            design. Can somebody get it done?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I would say that the
                            principle issue is the order of magnitude of the revaluation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petty: The study on the overall adjustment goals should be out here
                            [San Clemente] next week. Within those goals, there should be
                            implications for other countries. I don’t think we can move until we
                            know what Japan will do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We will not
                            negotiate in the Econ Com.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Before we are
                            driven by the pace of negotiations, can we get a look at the problem and
                            choices? If we don’t do that, <pb n="302" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_302"
                            />there is a great danger of being sucked into one technical position
                            after another. (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>)
                            Alex, can you get a paper ready?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. The big issue
                            of what kind of world monetary system we want has not yet been decided.
                            When that has been decided, we have to find out what adjustments in
                            exchange rates we seek from each country. Once we get those two problems
                            solved, everything else will fall into place.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s true on the
                            economic side. But we have to consider the political side, too. I want
                            to make sure we keep a balance between China and Japan.</p>

                            desire to make. Additionally, I and my Cabinet Committee colleagues are
                            meeting on September 2 with representatives of the non-governmental
                            Advisory Council on Japan-U.S. Economic Relations.</p>
                        <p>Very simply stated, our underlying objective is to preserve and
                            strengthen our vitally important relationship with Japan. We should
                            stress the importance which we attach to close cooperation with Japan
                            and our recognition of her role as a responsible, cooperative world
                            power. At the same time, we should attempt to persuade Japanese
                            ministers to accept the fact that such a role requires early and
                            effective measures to establish an appropriate balance in its external
                            economic relationships, including those with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>If we are to achieve these objectives, and recognizing there may be
                            special characteristics of the Japanese system, we must avoid appearing
                            to single out Japan for discriminatory treatment on economic matters. As
                            when dealing with other major countries, proposals from our side should
                            be consistent with a broader equilibrium in the world economy.</p>
                        <p>We must also remember the oft-repeated Japanese plea to the United
                            States, “Tell us what you want us to do, but don’t publicly press us to
                            do it.”</p>
                        <p>The Japanese ministers should be made to understand that the U.S. will
                            have to achieve a major turn-around in its balance of payments. Speaking
                            plainly, this will require that countries which have run huge surpluses
                            in their balance of payments with us will no longer be able to do so.
                            Some countries which have had deficits with us will have to see those
                            deficits increase. Given the large trading relationship between Japan
                            and the United States, which we wish to see expanded, and the U.S. need
                            for a satisfactory multilateral equilibrium, we will require a
                            reasonably balanced trading relationship between the two countries. Our
                            analysis strongly indicates that a global trade <hi rend="italic"
                                >surplus</hi> of the dimension necessary for the U.S. equilibrium
                            cannot be achieved with a <hi rend="italic">deficit</hi> in our Japanese
                            trade. It is our intention to review constantly progress in our over-all
                            balance, and to appraise the consistency of developments in important
                            bilateral accounts, to assure achievement of our goal. We hope Japan
                            recognizes the validity of this analysis and aim, and will periodically
                            review progress with us.</p>
                        <p><pb n="304" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_304"/>To this end, we should seek as
                            priorities:</p>
                        <p>1) A clear understanding by the Japanese ministers that the United States
                            considers a major revaluation of the yen in relation to the dollar to be
                            a condition precedent to a satisfactory economic relationship with the
                            United States. We would not at this meeting indicate the level which we
                            would consider satisfactory or negotiate bilaterally on this subject. If
                            the Japanese proposed a figure in the neighborhood of 10%, we would need
                            to indicate a larger order of magnitude is necessary. We would also
                            indicate that we feel negotiations on this subject should be carried out
                            in whatever multilateral forum is agreed upon by Europe, Japan and
                            ourselves, referring to the September 15 meeting of the “Group of
                            Ten.”</p>
                        <p>2) We should seek elimination of Japanese quotas and other restrictions
                            illegal under the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> as well as
                            non-tariff barriers and export subsidies, including tax incentives for
                            exports.</p>
                        <p>We are particularly interested in the removal of quotas on certain farm
                            products, computers, aircraft, and integrated circuits.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we should seek:</p>
                        <p>3) Significant unilateral reductions of Japanese tariffs.</p>
                        <p>4) Japanese encouragement of imports, especially by general stimulation
                            of the Japanese economy and investment in social infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>5) We should recognize as constructive the establishment unilaterally by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> of a system to monitor Japanese
                            exports to the United States of sensitive goods; e.g., automobiles,
                            calculators, consumer electronics.</p>
                        <p>6) We should seek substantial, indeed dramatic, increase in the amount of
                            Japanese economic aid, especially in Southeast Asia. Even more important
                            than the amount would be softening of terms; e.g., less emphasis on
                            export promotion and more on simple grant assistance.</p>
                        <p>7) We should seek increased Japanese military procurement in the United
                            States as the Japanese defense budget rises.</p>
                        <p>8) Elimination of restrictions on capital investment inconsistent with
                            our Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation and with the
                            obligations which the Japanese have assumed in the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, all of the above, except for the degree of revaluation which
                            we seek, are included to a greater or lesser extent in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>’s eight-point program already approved
                            or in the package which the Foreign Office, the new Foreign Minister,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> are trying to get
                            accepted.</p>
                        <p>At this meeting the Japanese will above all want to know our price for
                            removal of the 10% surcharge. This is however, important to us in our
                            negotiations relating to our total position with other countries, as
                            well as Japan, and must in any case await a satisfactory overall
                            exchange <pb n="305" facs="0336" xml:id="pg_305"/>rate settlement. All
                            we can say at this meeting is to promise its removal, as soon as our
                            external position is assured.</p>
                        <p>We should stress, however, the very important steps which we are taking
                            within the United States to correct the contribution of our own
                            inflation to our trade imbalance.</p>
                        <p>On the side of our cooperation with Japan, we should offer cooperation
                            with the Japanese in the following areas in which we have mutual
                            interests.</p>
                        <quote><p>a) Joint effort to seek liberalization of the trade policies of
                                the European community.</p>
                            <p>b) Work within the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> High Level
                                Group to prepare the way for a major multilateral attack on trade

                            <p>c) Development of international procedures for adjudicating
                                investment disputes in developing countries.</p>
                            <p>d) A program to encourage private investors of both countries to
                                establish joint ventures in less developed countries in an effort to
                                obtain greater security for these investments.</p>
                            <p>e) Closer scientific collaboration in seeking solutions to common
                                problems in the fields of transportation and ecology.</p>
                            <p>f) In the field of <hi rend="italic">nuclear energy</hi> we should
                                reaffirm the offer which we have made to ten countries—the <gloss

                                multilateral basis.</p>
                            <p>g) We should assure the Japanese that immediately upon the completion

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought we
                            should have a fairly brief session on the upcoming Econ Com meeting.
                            Given the importance we attach to this meeting and given the decision by
                            the Japanese emissaries to work all the side streets in town, I thought
                            we ought to go over the issues as they have been resolved.</p>
                        <p>The President will sign this afternoon a decision memorandum which is
                            close to what everyone has proposed. Perhaps I can go through it. In any
                            case, it will be distributed later this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>I presume you have all seen the State paper [Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>’ memorandum to the President of

                            Treasury here?</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGinnis: Yes. Paul [<persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>]
                            will be here in a few minutes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn’t want you
                            to think you were disassociated from us. I don’t know if I should run
                            through the memorandum because the President has not signed it yet.
                            Basically, it follows the Secretary’s memorandum and the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEP_1">CIEP</gloss> paper. They are all close together.
                            We will distribute the decision paper later this afternoon, and, if
                            there are any objections, we should know what they are. (to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) Alex, why don’t you
                            lead off the discussion? What do we want to get out of the meeting? What
                            line should we take?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: All of that is
                            basically in the Secretary’s memorandum, and it’s hard to improve upon
                            it because I had a hand in its drafting.<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5"
                                >According to the original minutes, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> then said, “I’m glad to see that the
                                Secretary [<persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>] has
                                difficulty putting up with you, just as I do.” This comment was
                                covered over with white correction tape.</note></p>
                        <p>We tried to be as succinct as possible in the paper. We have, on the one
                            hand, the objective of preserving and strengthening our relationship
                            with Japan. We all agree that it is vitally important to maintain this
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we should try to persuade the Japanese ministers to
                            accept the fact that they have to take early and effective measures to
                            establish an appropriate balance in Japan’s external economic
                            relationships, including those with the United States. Of course, we’re
                            not out to make enemies of the Japanese, either.</p>
                        <p><pb n="308" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_308"/>We have found that our economic
                            relationship has been mutually beneficial. In recent years, however, our
                            economic and trade relationships have been distorted. Now we have to try
                            to convince the Japanese that our trade and economic relationships have
                            to be redressed. We should point out to them that we are not singling
                            them out and that we have problems with the rest of the world, too, but
                            to a different degree.</p>
                        <p>Above all, we have to impress upon the Japanese that we expect some
                            readjustment of the exchange rate. They have already taken some steps in
                            this direction. The floating of the yen has resulted in some
                            revaluation—just about 7 percent—but this amount is considered by
                            everyone to be inadequate. We must get across to them that we want a
                            major readjustment. However, we will not negotiate monetary policy at
                            the meeting; it will be done in a multilateral framework. The first step
                            in that direction was taken last Friday at the Group of Ten meeting in
                            Paris which <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Paul Volcker</persName>
                            attended. The next meeting, I believe, is on September 15 in London. As
                            I said before, we will not seek to negotiate a bilateral agreement with
                            the Japanese at the Econ Com meeting.</p>
                        <p>The other side of the spectrum is getting Japan to open up her trading. A
                            revaluation of the yen should make the terms of trade more equal and
                            should improve our ability to sell in Japan. At the meeting, both we and
                            the Japanese should set forth the steps we are willing to take. The big
                            problem is the speed with which the Japanese can move on this. The
                            ability of <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and his
                            government to move is circumscribed by the traditional Japanese
                            attitudes and by the dissent in the Cabinet and the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> Party on the Chirep issue. Chirep is
                            the most divisive issue in the Japanese political world right now. It is
                            even more important than the economic issue. The Japanese are engaged in
                            their own great China debate. No matter how hard we push or urge them to
                            move, we cannot expect dramatic results from the meeting. Many of us
                            hoped for and talked about dramatic steps which the Japanese might make,
                            but this will not be the case. <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> and the Foreign Office have been pursuing a
                            policy similar to our own. However, they have not been able to move the
                            Japanese ministries to the degree that would enable <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> to take dramatic steps.</p>
                        <p>Phil [<persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>] has been in Tokyo
                            recently, and perhaps he can fill us in on the mood there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: Basically, I’d like
                            to underscore what Alex [<persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                            >Johnson</persName>] said. The <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> government is in its last months, and the
                            ministries are not anxious to go through with the exercise. Some of the
                            ministers are in competition for top jobs in the new government. In the
                            Ministries of Agriculture and Finance, where the hard decisions must be
                            made, the bureaucrats are not ready to go along with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>. The situation there reminds me
                            of the last months of the Kishi regime.</p>
                        <p><pb n="309" facs="0340" xml:id="pg_309"/><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName> entered the meeting at
                                this point.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We are fortunate
                            that <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> is the Foreign
                            Minister and the leader of the delegation. He has long experience on the
                            financial side. Given the Japanese system, though, he has certain limits
                            on how far and fast he can move. The Japanese have an admiration for our
                            ability to move. They admire the fact that the President can make a
                            decision and then have it carried out. They can’t act that way because
                            it is not in the Japanese tradition and because <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> is a lame duck.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: There’s one other
                            thing I would like to mention. By Japanese standards, their economy has
                            been in recession for quite a while. While they are providing a big
                            fiscal stimulus in an expanded public works program—about the equivalent
                            of $20 billion in the U.S. economy—it will take some time before its
                            effects are felt. No one expects their economy to be in high gear until
                            the second quarter of next year at the earliest. This is the first time
                            they have had to bring the economy back from a self-induced slowdown,
                            and no one knows how long it will take. The surcharge and even a limited
                            revaluation have a deflationary effect. The Japanese ministers will of
                            course, be taking all of this into consideration.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>) Pete, what do you think?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>) Phil, I just received two
                            conflicting reports on textiles.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Both of them are
                            probably true.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>) What is your assessment?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: I was told on
                            Wednesday that <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> had met
                            with the industry and that he was stonewalled. He put on a good
                            performance, I understand, and he went back the following day, but there
                            were still no more results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Is it likely then
                            that they will come here with nothing?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The signs point to
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>) What do you think of the
                            substance of what we should all say?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: It’s not clear to
                            me what emphasis we are going to put on the balance of payments goals.
                            Do you think we should talk to them in specifics?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: You saw our
                            memorandum and the draft of the Secretary’s opening remarks.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d93fn6">The memorandum to which <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"

                                1971, pp. 346–350.</note> We put an adjustment of the exchange <pb
                                n="310" facs="0341" xml:id="pg_310"/>rate and revaluation at the top
                            of the list. We presume these subjects will be discussed somewhat in the
                            large group and by <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> and
                            Mizuta [Japanese Finance Minister] in private.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: We thought that
                            would not come up for discussion in the large group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: It probably will be
                            discussed, but in broad terms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: Will we go beyond
                            those broad terms?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Probably not.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will we discuss
                            percentages?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: Needless to say, the
                            percentages are very important.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We will make it
                            clear that we won’t negotiate percentages in the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we say
                            something about percentages privately?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: I don’t think we
                            should be very specific. We gave them an indication that we wanted a
                            bigger revaluation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Samuels</persName>: You know, if we go
                            through the various measures we want them to take, there is not one item
                            where they are not already doing something. It’s a question of getting
                            them to accelerate and expand those measures. We have to tell them that
                            they are not doing enough. I think it’s important to make that
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: Phil’s point about
                            the recession is important. Do we recognize it in any of our papers?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes, we do—in the
                            Secretary’s opening statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> will probably discuss in some
                            depth our balance of payments problem. He will point out that our
                            multilateral objective is to achieve a rough balance, and we hope the
                            Japanese can accept that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Hopefully, we will
                            also get a response on this subject in the general meeting. I don’t know
                            what they will say about their balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have two
                            concerns. The first is the problem we could have if we all say something
                            different to the Japanese. If we disagree, we should know it now and get
                            it resolved so that they don’t go from agency to agency, brokering our
                            views. I assume the President’s memorandum will be scrupulously adhered
                            to. There should be no variation from it—either on the tough side or the
                            soft side—and we will present a united front. The tough decisions that
                            they have to make will be delayed if they see disunity on our side.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I’m glad you said
                            that. We know the proclivity of the Japanese for using the back door,
                            with such things as special meetings and emissaries. I have gone through
                            it for years. To the degree that we can force the Japanese to deal with
                            us in the established channels, the better off we will be.</p>
                        <p><pb n="311" facs="0342" xml:id="pg_311"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: That is also the President’s view [have the
                            Japanese deal with us in established channels].</p>
                        <p>I guess I should read the memo the President is sending to the Secretary
                            of State. If someone cannot live with this memo, we had better hear
                            about it right now.</p>
                        <p>(Reads memorandum through point 3.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: How did we come up
                            with those figures? [referring to the last sentence of point 3, which
                            reads: “While negotiations on the exact amount of yen revaluation sought
                            should be carried out multilaterally, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> is authorized privately, if
                            he wishes, to inform the Japanese Ministers that a revaluation in the
                            range of 15 to 20 percent is necessary.”]</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you think the
                            figure [for revaluation] should be bigger, we should know about it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Is it credible to
                            start out with a higher figure than 20 percent?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: Yes, I think so. If
                            we start out by saying 15 to 20 percent, we will end up with 15 percent,
                            and that’s not enough.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is the sort
                            of point we should know about now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: If we want a 15
                            percent adjustment overall, I think we should start out with a bigger
                            figure than 20 percent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Samuels</persName>: Should we tell the
                            Japanese that it would take more than a 20 percent revaluation to bring
                            our trade account into bilateral balance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: No. I didn’t say we
                            should tell them that.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Japanese will
                            not be forced to say anything. If we say, however, that we want more
                            than a 15 to 20 percent revaluation, that would become more of a
                            political point than an economic one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: They might say they
                            are thinking of an 11 percent revaluation, but they certainly would not
                            expect us to say that.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are not
                            required to say anything. The 15 to 20 percent figure merely gives us a
                            judgment of where we would like to end up. If we are going to say we
                            want more than a 20 percent revaluation, we ought to know about it right
                            now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>) Do you agree that if the
                            Secretary feels like discussing a 15 to 20 percent revaluation, that
                            would be all right? However, if he wants to discuss a higher figure, we
                            ought to know what he will say.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: I assure you he will
                            not want to talk about a 13 percent revaluation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can you assure us
                            he will not say that a 25 percent revaluation is necessary?</p>
                        <p><pb n="312" facs="0343" xml:id="pg_312"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1"
                                >Trezise</persName>: We came up with the 15 to 20 percent range as a
                            result of interagency discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: For an overall
                            adjustment, we need a yen revaluation of 15 percent or more.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>) Pete, what do you think?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: Paul [<persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>], as you know, the paper has a
                            number that is in the ball park, as you gave it to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: I said I was
                            cautious about the figures.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it would
                            be better to distribute the President’s memorandum instead of reading
                            the rest of it. Everyone will follow it, unless we are told about
                            objections beforehand. If there are objections, the President will
                            adjudicate them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: Is it correct to say
                            that nobody except <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> will
                            discuss exchange rates?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s correct. No
                            one except Treasury will speak about revaluation. As I said before,
                            though, if you want to go beyond 20 percent, we ought to know about
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: I understand.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will have the
                            memo distributed. That’s better than forcing you to react orally. I hope
                            we can have your responses to the memo in the morning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>: On another matter,
                            when I saw <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> [Japanese
                            Ambassador to the U.S.] recently, he mentioned the mandarin orange
                            issue. The Japanese want the right to sell mandarin oranges here.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Hardin</persName> [Secretary of
                            Agriculture] mentioned this problem to the President and told him that
                            Illinois and two other states were not orange-producing states. Our
                            response up to now has been that the Japanese not be allowed to sell
                            mandarin oranges in places where our orange-producing trees might be
                            damaged. Now that Cliff [<persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Hardin</persName>]
                            has volunteered three states where there are no orange-producing trees,
                            perhaps we can be more forthcoming to the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName>: It sounds like
                            bacteriological warfare to me.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I think we can put
                            something in the communiqué about it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is everyone
                            prepared to speak about mandarin oranges?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: If Cliff wants to do
                            something, it’s okay with me.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me return now
                            to the second general concern I have. On the political side, we have a
                            delicate problem. We want to reassure the Japanese and have their
                            confidence in us restored. On the other hand, there is the China
                            problem. We want to avoid creating the impression that we are in
                            collusion with the Japanese on our China <pb n="313" facs="0344"
                                xml:id="pg_313"/>policy. Therefore, we must strike a delicate
                            balance of friendship with Japan and not give the impression that they
                            have a veto power over our China policy.</p>
                        <p>The worst outcome would be if we convinced the Chinese we were getting
                            into bed with the Japanese, and if, at the same time, we antagonized the
                            Japanese. This could happen, for example, if we follow an extreme
                            economic policy against Japan and follow it up by issuing flowery
                            statements of friendship. It could also happen if we have press
                            leaks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: You are right. That
                            could happen.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) Alex, you should monitor the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I will. In this
                            connection, let me bring up the matter of the Japanese purchasing arms
                            here. We see no need to mention it in the communiqué. They will buy the
                            arms if they are interested—and we know that. There would be no
                            advantage—from either the Chinese or Japanese view point—in putting this
                            in the communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we’ve
                            covered the major points that had to be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: We should bear in
                            mind that <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>’s main rival is
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> [Minister of
                            International Trade and Industry]. Therefore, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> has his own delicate problem
                            within the delegation. In our dealings with the Japanese ministers, we
                            have got to realize that there is feuding and fighting going on for
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s mantle. We have also
                            got to remember that the Japanese system is Parliamentary, not
                            Presidential.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would think that
                            the economic agencies would stay out of the political issues because of
                            the impact it could have on the Japanese domestic scene.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I agree. As I said
                            before, China is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> issue in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Anyway, no
                            economic agency should have an interest in discussing the political
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: It’s good for us
                            that the China issue has now become more important than the economic
                            ones.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: No. It’s not good
                            because it puts added inhibitions on <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> on the economic issues.</p>
                        <p>This should be an interesting meeting. A big problem will be the press,
                            particularly the Japanese press, which is coming in full strength. The
                            Japanese delegation is planning to have briefings on a regular
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>We should consider the question of having a joint press conference at the
                            end of the meeting. That’s the normal procedure, and failure to do so
                            now would certainly be marked in Japan as a sign of our not being able
                            to get together. On the other hand, if we hold a joint press <pb n="314"
                                facs="0345" xml:id="pg_314"/>conference, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> would be faced with a barrage
                            of unanswerable questions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would it be better
                            if <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> has a press conference
                            of his own?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I’m sure he will do
                            so in any event. One alternative might be for <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> and the Secretary to hold
                            back-to-back press conferences.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That could result
                            in some discrepancies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right. We
                            have to know what our story is and what the Japanese will say. The
                            Secretary has often asked: “If we don’t know what we want to say, how do
                            we say it?” We will have to deal with some difficult questions. The
                            press will want to know, for example, if revaluation was discussed and
                            when the surcharge will be removed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Those questions
                            can be dealt with. The answer to the question on the surcharge is: “When
                            external conditions permit.” The Secretary could also say that
                            revaluation was discussed and that it will be negotiated in a
                            multilateral framework.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA_1">Volcker</persName>: He’s sure to be
                            asked what agreements came out of the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The answer to that
                            question is simple: “The agreement to disagree.”</p>
                        <p>We will circulate a draft communiqué and get all your comments and
                            suggestions. Yoshino, the Japanese equivalent of <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM_1">Marshall Green</persName> for the U.S., is with
                            the delegation. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Phil Trezise</persName>
                            will be getting together with him this evening to work on the
                            communiqué. It will be tough to draft. Hopefully, though, we can get it
                            to you tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH_1">Trezise</persName>: Hopefully.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Once we get a draft,
                            we can circulate it and get your comments. In my experience, if there
                            are 25 drafters, it’s not an effective way of producing a paper. We will
                            have to have a small group working on the communiqué throughout the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>There are a couple of other items I would like to mention. One is that
                            the Secretary had suggested that he meet with his Cabinet colleagues
                            before the meeting starts. In light of the President’s memorandum,
                            though, I’m not sure we need this meeting.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s wait until
                            we see what the reaction is to the memo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Okay. We’ll wait.
                            The other thing is that the President’s speech to Congress will cut in
                            on the counterpart lunches because most of the Cabinet members will
                            probably be on the Hill with the President. They won’t get back from the
                            Hill until about 1:30. Therefore, I’m having my staff shift the
                            counterpart lunches to Friday.</p>

                            know how many Cabinet members will be going with him.</p>

                            informed of all significant conversations. And let’s agree that everyone
                            follow the memo, unless objections are registered here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Let’s also stay in

                                which we believe highest priority—i.e., yen revaluation and trade
                                liberalization. And we would not give the Japanese so much in the

                            should endeavor to re-establish in the minds of the Japanese the
                            significance and closeness of the U.S.-Japanese relationship through a
                            series of forthcoming political and psychological measures. We
                            should:</p>
                        <quote><p>—Assure the Japanese that shortly after the <gloss

                                strong recommendation for its early ratification.</p>
                            <p>—Reaffirm our offer to explore with Japan and other countries the
                                possibility of selling them U.S. technology for use in gaseous

                            <p>—Indicate our desire to develop international procedures for
                                adjudicating investment disputes in developing
                            countries.</p></quote>
                        <p>2. The U.S. new economic policy, with special emphasis on our balance of
                            payments goals, should be clearly explained to the Japanese delegation.
                            We should state strongly that it is our conviction that a reasonably
                            balanced trade account between our two countries is necessary, and
                            feasible by the end of 1973. It should be pointed out that, as we
                            understand Japanese balance of payments and trade projections, they are
                            incompatible with our objectives. It should be proposed that we work
                            together to achieve mutually agreed compatible balance of payments
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>3. The overriding U.S. objective is to obtain a revaluation of the
                            currencies of our major trading partners, which will include a
                            substantial revaluation of the yen. While negotiations on the exact
                            amount of yen revaluation sought should be carried out multilaterally,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> is authorized
                            privately, if he wishes, to inform the Japanese Ministers that a
                            revaluation in the range of 15 to 20 percent is necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. We should indicate that we would remove the 10 percent surcharge only
                            when our external position is assured.</p>
                        <p><pb n="317" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_317"/>5. Beyond this, we wish to
                            achieve our balance of payments goals primarily through trade
                            liberalization, and we expect the Japanese to remove quotas and other
                            import restrictions illegal under the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>. We are particularly interested in prompt removal of
                            quotas on agricultural items, computers, aircraft, and integrated
                            circuits.</p>
                        <p>6. We should welcome the Japanese eight-point program, commend their
                            efforts so far, and urge them to go further.</p>
                        <p>7. It should be made clear to the Japanese that we still seek a
                            negotiated voluntary restraint agreement for textiles but will be
                            prepared to solve the problem in other ways if an agreement is not
                            forthcoming. Our continuing need for a voluntary restraint agreement for
                            steel exports should also be made clear.</p>
                        <p>8. We should stress our desire for even closer economic cooperation in
                            the future. To this end, we should propose periodic meetings with the
                            Japanese, starting with a special interagency mission to Japan by next
                            January to assess with the Japanese specific progress toward agreed upon
                            balance of payments goals, compatible economic policies and the
                            eight-point program, to identify remaining or emerging trade problems,
                            and to work out constructive, timely solutions to common economic
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>9. In discussing lower priority economic objectives, including increased
                            Japanese defense procurement in the United States, increased aid on
                            softer terms, and investment liberalization, our delegates should make
                            clear our wishes in low key, relating such secondary points to our
                            overall balance of payments goals.</p>

                        <p>In an interview September 1 with James Reston of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >New York Times,</hi> Japanese Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> went to some lengths to keep
                            current U.S.-Japanese problems in a balanced perspective. Specifically,
                            he:</p>
                        <p>—Said he has “great expectations” for the U.S.-Japan Econ Com cabinet
                            exchange next week, noting that the most important need would be for a
                            frank exchange of views with no “mincing of words” that left room for
                            misunderstanding. (Japan will clearly request as its highest priority
                            removal of the surcharge as soon as possible, citing the fact that it is
                            now floating the yen, and will ask for a clear and specific indication
                            of what the U.S. requires in order to remove the surcharge.)</p>
                        <p>—Acknowledged that there had been a serious Japanese domestic political
                            problem brought on by U.S.-China and economic initiatives.</p>
                        <p>—Expressed the concern that U.S.-Japan relations could be “impaired” by
                            political repercussions from our economic problems, but said “We are in
                            the same ship, so we must make every effort not to sink together.”</p>
                        <p>—Expressed his preference for tackling our basic economic problems in a
                            multilateral form such as the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> or
                            the Group of Ten. (This would avoid the appearance of the U.S. directly
                            inflicting its will on Japan, and make it easier for Japan to acquiesce
                            to our requests.)</p>
                        <p>—Said the current primary Japanese economic need was to stimulate its
                            economy, which would facilitate increased imports (including finished
                            goods as well as raw materials).</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Basic US-Japan Relationship</p>
                        <p>—Reaffirmed several times that Japan’s relationship with the U.S. is the
                            basis and pivot of its foreign policy, and said that the Mutual Security
                            Treaty is the basis of Japan’s security.</p>
                        <p>—Cited his “very close relationship” with you, and again welcomed a visit
                            by you to Japan (although saying it would be better following the visit
                            by the Emperor to the U.S.).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">China Policy</p>
                        <p>—Attributed Peking’s fears of resurgent Japanese militarism to “scars
                            left by Japanese militarists,” and cited political and constitutional
                            blocks to such a development.</p>
                        <p>—Reiterated Japan’s “One China” policy, and said Peking and Taipei should
                            resolve their differences by peaceful means.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>Within recent days the Chinese representation issue has become the major
                            political issue in Japan. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s
                            opposition apparently believes that he is most vulnerable on this issue,
                            and that his government will fall if he associates himself with a Chirep
                            strategy that fails. Most importantly, two of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s Liberal Democratic Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>) leaders, former Foreign Ministers
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>, have publicly come out in
                            opposition to Japanese support for our two Chirep resolutions. Both want
                            a Japanese position more in line with Peking’s demands. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>’s opposition was expected and
                            tolerable, but that of <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> is
                            somewhat different. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>, who is
                            leader of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>’s second strongest
                            faction (next to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s), has
                            previously supported <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> policy
                            and has been given the best chance of succeeding <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> as Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Adding pressure to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> on the
                            China issue has been the just-concluded visit of Wang Kuo-chuan, Vice
                            Chairman of Peking’s China-Japan Friendship Association. Wang was quite
                            successful in stimulating heightened Japanese interest in improved
                            relations with Peking, particularly among Japanese business leaders.</p>
                        <p>Embassy Tokyo reports that the Sato Government now apparently wants to
                            defer further consultations with us on Chirep until Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> arrives in Washington

                                350–353.</note> are:</p>
                        <p>—Japan stressed that the U.S. import surcharge had seriously affected the
                            Japanese economy, and a request that it be removed as soon as possible
                            since it would, if prolonged, encourage protectionism and threaten the
                            free trade system.</p>
                        <p>—Japan indicated that the eight-point trade and investment liberalization
                            program would be continued, although some adjustments would be necessary
                            as a result of the changed situation following the announcement of the
                            New Economic Policy.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. expressed concern at Japanese trade and investment
                            restrictions, and emphasized the importance of achieving full
                            reciprocity in the U.S.-Japan economic relationship.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. took the strong position that Japanese imbalance would require
                            it to eliminate its remaining quotas and other important restrictions,
                            as well as non-tariff barriers and export incentives, as rapidly as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. noted that the overly rapid expansion of exports can create
                            serious dislocations and political problems, and pointed out the need
                            for an orderly evolution of trade.</p>
                        <p>—Japan stated that within the context of its Eight-Point Program residual
                            import quota restrictions, now numbering sixty items, would be reduced
                            to forty items by the end of the month and that further liberalization
                            in 1972 was under study.</p>
                        <p><pb n="321" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_321"/>—Japan expressed its strong
                            apprehension over the increase of protectionist views in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. and Japan agreed on the importance of promoting joint cultural
                            activities, and the desirability of expanding joint U.S.-Japan research
                            in the natural and social sciences and such fields as transportation,
                            occupational health, and environmental problems.</p>
                        <p>On the whole discussions were amicable, but pointed up several unresolved
                            economic issues, the most important being how much the yen will be
                            revalued and how far Japan will move in the future to liberalize
                            imports.</p>

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> during the

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> conveyed Mr.

                            message that he wished to call on the President even though he had no

                        <p>The President said that he would welcome a visit by his old friend Mr.

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> then reviewed the
                            changes in the political situation in Japan, of which he had already
                            informed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> in
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that this had been reported to him.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> noted that the

                            had won its greatest post-war victory (303 seats) in the general
                            election (House of Representatives) of December, 1969, and that Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> last fall won
                            re-election to a 4th term as <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>
                            President. (The President of the majority party is then elected Prime
                            Minister by the Diet.) In the process, however, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> announced that he would not run
                            for a 5th term, and ever since then unity within the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> pointed out an unprecedented
                            political development: a sufficient number of dissident <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> Councillors joined the opposition
                            party coalition to elect an anti-<persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> candidate as President of the House
                            of Councillors, rejecting the incumbent regular candidate backed by
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In the Diet to be convened October 15, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> explained that China would be
                            the biggest, by far, of all the political problems. Both he and Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> agreed the
                            development of the China question is being greatly influenced by the
                            President’s announcement of his forthcoming visit to Peking. Both also
                            regretted that Japan has been unable, as yet, to develop its own
                            relations with such a large neighboring country as China, and they both
                            agreed that Japan should somehow normalize relations with Mainland
                            China. However, both were fully aware that Japan should exercise great
                            caution lest the process of normalization “shake” its relations with
                            Taiwan and the other nations in the region. He noted that Japan could
                            also lose the <pb n="323" facs="0354" xml:id="pg_323"/>respect of the
                            700–800 million Mainland Chinese if it appeared to be moving
                            opportunistically with the tide. The majority of the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> supported this position.</p>
                        <p>With respect to handling of the Chinese representation question in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> this fall, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> explained that the fundamental
                            view of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> is to support the entry
                            of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and to oppose the exclusion
                            of Taiwan. How to attain this common objective has been a subject of
                            close consultation between the governments of Japan and the United
                            States, he said, and the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> would
                            support and campaign in favor of the two resolutions about to be put
                            forward in the U.N. by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.
                            However, Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>
                            cautioned that the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> is not united in
                            favor of co-sponsorship. The China question does provide excellent
                            ammunition for the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> factions seeking
                            to undermine the Sato government and the slightest mistake in handling
                            Chinese representation could precipitate the greatest political crisis
                            faced by the Sato government since coming to power.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> noted that he
                            wished to repeat this to the President in detail even though he had
                            already reviewed it thoroughly with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> because he was not certain they
                            really understood the magnitude of the political crisis in the
                            offing.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> explained that the
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> forces within the
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> opposed co-sponsorship for a
                            variety of other reasons, but all were united in their suspicion that
                            the United States must have made a promise to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> during the discussions about the
                            President’s visit to Peking, that the United States would abandon Taiwan
                            and “shake hands” with Peking. Therefore, they are urging, Japan should
                            not be left out. Even if one conceded a certain amount of campaign
                            rhetoric in this, Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>
                            pointed out that this argument is pervasive.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed understanding for the delicate political position
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>. It is important, he said,
                            to recognize what the United States position is, to respect the position
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> is in, and to point out the
                            need for each government and nation to determine its own course of
                            action on the basis of its own national interests. We, like Japan, have
                            a long and close relationship with Taiwan; we, like Japan, believe that
                            peace in the Pacific, in the long run, requires the participation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. With respect to the technical
                            problem with the U.N., Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> has stated the United States position publicly,
                            and to Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> privately,
                            that is, that we would support the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            entry but would oppose the expulsion of Taiwan from the U.N. We believed
                            this to be a correct position.</p>
                        <p>For Japan’s part, the President said, the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> needed to consult its own interest to determine whether
                            to support our position, which the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            agrees is the right one, or whether to go further and co-sponsor the two
                            resolutions. However, he felt that Japan must do this in terms <pb
                                n="324" facs="0355" xml:id="pg_324"/>of its own view of the
                            situation. We would proceed to work for our position; he said, but would
                            respect other nations’ rights to make their own decision with respect to
                            the degree of support it would give, especially a nation so closely
                            identified with this question.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the long term, the President said that as realists we
                            both knew that we are only beginning what might be a better relationship
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. The President assured
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> (as he assured
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>) that when we
                            begin our discussion with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> there
                            are no conditions on either side; there is no condition for the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> to do something in Southeast Asia, and
                            there is no condition that we do anything about other situations. Each
                            side is as aware as the other that we are beginning a basic dialogue. In
                            the light of it, he said, the necessity is clear for continued close
                            relations between the governments of the United States and Japan,
                            because, even though we are strong economic competitors as discussed in
                            the <gloss target="#t_ECONCOM_1">ECONCOM</gloss>, our friendship is
                            essential to the peace of East Asia and the Pacific, and indeed the
                            entire world.</p>
                        <p>By this, the President said, he did not mean that our positions should be
                            identical, for each nation is a strong independent power, which must
                            consult its own interests.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that we continue our personal relations, and the
                            consultations between us, noting that he would see Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> again in Anchorage September 26,
                            together with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>.
                            This situation is difficult for both of us, but the President noted that
                            our interests are somewhat common.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out the illogical and false position of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s political opponents who did not
                            wish to help maintain Taiwan’s seat in the U.N.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> leadership had no doubts about the President’s
                            position; but some dissident factions were using this issue to undermine
                            the Sato government. Therefore he welcomed the President’s encouraging
                            remarks, and expressed the wish to convey their substance to the
                            political leaders in Japan. Although he had earlier promised the
                            Secretary to keep this conversation in complete confidence, he now
                            believed that it is best to say something.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the United States’ position has been stated
                            publicly by the Secretary. He understood that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> supported that position, but was also
                            presented with political problems, and recognized that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> must make its own decision based on
                            its evaluation of the situation, just as we do. He said that he was not
                            putting pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> said that he
                            wished only to inform political leaders in order to correct erroneous
                            reporting about the President’s visit to <pb n="325" facs="0356"
                                xml:id="pg_325"/>Peking. As he said earlier, neither he nor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> had entertained any
                            doubts, but he did wish to inform other political leaders of these
                            encouraging remarks by the President.</p>
                        <p>The President did not believe there would be any harm in doing so.<note

                            were prepared early this summer, most observers believed that US-Japan
                            relations, while under <pb n="327" facs="0358" xml:id="pg_327"/>some
                            strains primarily in economic affairs, were basically sound, and that in
                            Japan itself the relationship rested on a stable domestic political
                            base. In fact, we said that political elements favoring a close and
                            cooperative relationship with the US would in all likelihood remain in
                            power for at least the next five years.</p>
                        <p>We could not make the same statements today. The relationship is
                            currently going through its most difficult period since the end of World
                            War II. The President’s intention to visit Peking and our new economic
                            policies, both, however justifiably, announced without prior warning or
                            consultations with the Japanese, have had a profoundly unsettling effect
                            on the internal political situation in Japan. The current government and
                            its supporters now find themselves wide open to attack on what have
                            always been their fundamental political assets—the special relationship
                            with the United States, public confidence in their ability to manage the
                            economy, and their ability to deal profitably with both Peking and
                            Taipei. Their most effective opponents come from within the ruling
                            party’s own ranks, and the mainstream elements led by Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> are now in real danger
                            of losing control of the government.</p>
                        <p>This issue may well be decided by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            debate on the Chirep issue. The <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>
                            could not reach a consensus on the question of co-sponsorship of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IQ_1">IQ</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DR_1"
                                >DR</gloss> resolutions proposed by the US.<note n="3"

                                in the United Nations, the U.S. delegation introduced the <gloss

                                    >DR</gloss> resolutions: the first would have made any proposal
                                to expel the Republic of China an “important question” requiring
                                support from 2/3 of the United Nations member states; the second,
                                “dual representation” resolution advocated that the People’s
                                Republic of China be admitted to the United Nations but also
                                affirmed that the Republic of China have continued right of
                                representation.</note> After weeks of intra-party wrangling, the
                            party polarized on this issue. Major factional leaders—<persName
                                corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NY_1"
                                >Nakasone</persName>, and most critically, <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>—declared their firm opposition to
                            co-sponsorship. They and their factional adherents probably constituted
                            a majority of the party. The responsibility for the decision, however,
                            was handed to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. In a rare
                            demonstration of decisiveness, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> opted to co-sponsor. In his press interview he
                            attempted to make it plain that this decision was based only on what he
                            conceived as Japan’s best interest and carefully avoided any indication
                            that pressure from the United States had been a factor.</p>
                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> the political risks are
                            high whether the resolutions succeed or not. If they pass, Peking has
                            grounds to accuse <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> of being
                            the decisive factor and, given the intensity of the present pro-China
                            mood now prevalent in Japan, Peking’s wrath could be very harmful. If
                            the resolutions are defeated, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> would be accused of having blindly followed US
                            leadership and of permitting the US to use him as a <pb n="328"
                                facs="0359" xml:id="pg_328"/>scapegoat. Peking’s reaction will
                            doubtless still be negative and the loss of face and confidence in his
                            judgment would probably be politically fatal. But <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was aware that if he decided not
                            to co-sponsor and the resolutions were defeated, American opinion would
                            put the blame on him. He clearly identified this as the greatest risk of
                            all.</p>
                        <p>This fluid domestic political situation will be further roiled in the
                            coming weeks. On October 15, a special Diet session convenes for a
                            debate on the US-Japan relationship. The immediate occasion for this is
                            the need to ratify the Okinawa Reversion Agreement. While there is
                            little doubt that the Agreement itself will pass, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> is already under severe attack for its
                            willingness to permit the US to maintain its extensive base network on
                            Okinawa. It is argued that the President’s forthcoming visit to Peking
                            demonstrates that the risks from a hostile China are so diminished that
                            the bases are no longer necessary and in fact constitute an obstacle to
                            Japan’s own rapprochement with Peking. There are other potential areas
                            of embarrassment in the Okinawa Agreement, including the financial
                            settlement and the nuclear weapons question. The latter in particular
                            has explosive political potential in Japan, and the Senate’s requests
                            for information on some aspects of this question should be answered only
                            in executive session.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the US Government has stated that it will impose quotas on
                            imports of textiles on October 15 (the day the Diet convenes), unless
                            Japan and other major exporting countries reach satisfactory
                            government-to-government agreements with us. It is difficult to predict
                            what the Japanese government’s response will be. Domestic opposition to
                            an agreement is formidable and the unilateral imposition of quotas would
                            also further consume a fair portion of what remains of the present
                            government’s political capital.</p>
                        <p>It is clear then that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s days
                            are numbered and that problems associated with the United States are to
                            be the proximate cause of his downfall. The problem for the United
                            States is that the political fabric in Japan on which we must rely to
                            obtain decisions and actions favorable to our interests has worn
                            perilously thin. It can take only so much more weight. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s passing does not concern us, and
                            in any event it now seems inevitable. What does concern us is that his
                            passing not be precipitated by an issue in US-Japan relations or in a
                            highly-charged emotional atmosphere. It is very much in our interests
                            that he be able to pass the Prime Ministership to a successor who will
                            be disposed favorably to maintain a cooperative relationship with the US
                            and to see that the atmosphere is such that this will be possible.</p>
                        <p>B. Economic</p>
                        <p>Japan has remerged as a major power via its economic strength. Gross
                            National Product has been held as the summum bonum of domestic economic
                            policy and there is little doubt that the policy has <pb n="329"
                                facs="0360" xml:id="pg_329"/>been successful. Real Japanese economic
                            growth over the last decade has averaged near 10%. <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> at market prices has risen from $43
                            billion in 1960 to $196 billion in 1970.</p>
                        <p>This growth has been achieved through close cooperation between the
                            Government of Japan, the business community and the financial community.
                            The basic strategy for growth has been progressively to develop more
                            technically advanced industrial sectors where labor productivity will be
                            significantly increased. Given Japan’s static labor pool, the
                            implementation of this policy has meant a steady re-distribution of the
                            labor force out of less productive sectors and into new industrial
                            sectors. Japan has made the policy choice to allow less productive
                            industries to wither away while helping to alleviate the social problems
                            associated with such a change. As in the United States, the shift in
                            industrial production has resulted in significant domestic political
                            problems. This is especially true due to the strong support given by the
                            rural areas to the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
                        <p>To carry out this program of economic development Japan has protected her
                            technically advanced industrial sectors from foreign competition while
                            applying similar protection to her declining industries to ease the
                            socio-cultural and political problems associated with this industrial
                            transition. (Japan’s restrictions against foreign investment are founded
                            more on socio-cultural and institutional structures than on economic
                            rationale, but this makes them less, rather than more, susceptible to
                            amelioration.) Within this policy lies the essence of Japan’s present
                            international trade problems. Japan has fostered a protective economic
                            policy for its domestic economic development while needing a free trade
                            world to support its economy and future economic growth.</p>
                        <p>Japan needs a free trade world because it is almost devoid of natural
                            resources. Importing these resources is the key to any possibility of
                            economic growth. To pay for these imports Japan must export to get
                            foreign exchange. To export it must have access to world markets. A free
                            trade world is therefore critical to Japan’s national interests.</p>
                        <p>Japan is presently going through a very difficult transition in economic
                            policy. The protectionist domestic economic development policy that has
                            been so successful in the past must be altered as a quid pro quo for
                            continued free access to the United States and other major markets for
                            Japanese products. This transition is causing and will continue to cause
                            economic loss and business anxiety among politically prominent interest
                            groups in Japan which are the foundation of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1"
                                >LDP</gloss>. The present government is committed to such a change
                            in policy but the tendency will be to implement this policy as slowly as
                            possible to minimize the political repercussions.</p>

                            needed to achieve our pressing economic and military objectives will
                            become progressively weaker and narrower, and the departure of <persName

                            cooperative with the United States, more vulnerable to Chinese pressure
                            (for a while at least), and less stable domestically and less
                            predictable in the conduct of its international affairs.</p>
                        <p>We should not ignore the fact that our movements on China, our economic
                            measures, the textile issue, and the divisive debate on the Chirep issue
                            have resulted, on the Japanese side at least, in a palpable crisis of
                            confidence. The importance of maintaining good relations with Japan for
                            security, economic and political purposes, if the United States is to
                            retain any influence or interest in East Asia, is too obvious to require
                            discussion here. What may not be so obvious, however, is that Japan is
                            not a monolithic society, permanently ruled by a cabal of like-<pb
                                n="331" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_331"/>minded politicians, bureaucrats
                            and businessmen who see Japan as tied to the US come what may. Japanese
                            history demonstrates that the response of these emotional people to
                            foreign pressure has often been a drastic and unpredictable change in
                            national policy and outlook.</p>
                        <p>A crisis of confidence between nations is admittedly hard to dispel,
                            especially when the policies which caused it in the first place must be
                            pursued, as is the case with the China détente and the amelioration of
                            our economic difficulties. We could do some things, however, in the
                            political-psychological field which might improve the situation:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Consultation on
                            China</p>
                        <p>Above all a mood of resentment and mistrust toward the U.S. in Japan
                            could be dispelled by visible evidence that we are consulting with the
                            Japanese leadership about our intentions and expectations with respect
                            to the President’s Peking trip and its aftermath. Security is admittedly
                            a problem here but personal talks by senior Americans with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> under clearly identified ground rules could be
                            maintained in security. The Japanese need not be informed of
                            particularly sensitive aspects of the problem—the form and style of
                            consultation is perhaps as important for them as the substance—but it is
                            doubtful that the position of our friends in Japan could withstand
                            further surprises on this issue of the magnitude of the July 15
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese sensitivity on this subject is heightened by their analysis
                            of why the Chinese have agreed to permit the President to visit Peking.
                            It is that Chinese objectives have less to do with Vietnam, the Soviet
                            dispute or the establishment of a permanent peace in Asia, than with the
                            destruction of the US-Japan relationship, the removal of the US presence
                            from Asia, and the replacement of the present leadership with one more
                            amenable to Peking’s bidding.</p>
                        <p>Our consultation with the Japanese might take the form of asking the
                            Japanese to tell us what it is that they are afraid we might do in
                            Peking which would cause difficulty for them, so that we could have this
                            clearly in mind during the visit and be able more effectively to carry
                            out our assurance that we will make no decisions with Peking which would
                            be harmful to the interests of our old friends.</p>
                        <p>It may be felt that consultations with the Japanese will lead them to
                            attempt unduly to influence the course of our move with respect to
                            Peking. This has not been our experience with the Japanese to date.
                            Moreover, were they to object to any particular action, it would
                            probably be for a good cause and we would be in a position to determine
                            whether or not the move we intended to make would in fact be more
                            destructive of our relations with Japan than helpful with respect to
                            China. If then we proceeded against Japan’s advice and/or the Japanese
                            were to make our intentions public, the reaction in Peking would
                            doubtless be more favorable than otherwise.</p>
                        <p><pb n="332" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_332"/>If it is considered impossible
                            to consult in a meaningful way with the Japanese before the visit to
                            Peking, it would be vitally necessary to inform them immediately
                            thereafter of the results as they affect Japanese interests. A high
                            official, best of all the Secretary of State, might return from Peking
                            via Tokyo for this purpose.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> EconCom Consultation</p>
                        <p>Consultation on economic matters is also a continuing need. Obviously,
                            the Cabinet-level meetings should continue, augmented by the sub-Cabinet
                            meetings agreed to at EconCom VIII to review progress toward our
                            economic objectives. This is an excellent means of maintaining pressure
                            on the Japanese Government. If these consultations do not prove adequate
                            to the purpose, they might be the means to develop other types of
                            surveillance actions—perhaps a joint US/Japan commercial complaints
                            board or a joint statistical “early warning” committee to pinpoint
                            adverse developments and trends before they become major problems.</p>

                            become as important as substance. The Japanese are deeply conscious of
                            and uncomfortable in the knowledge that the President has announced his
                            intention to visit Peking when there has never been a visit by either
                            head of state between Japan and the United States. The President’s trip
                            to Anchorage to greet the Emperor has helped to meet this lack, but it
                            is no real substitute.<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5"><persName

                            would be preferable to have a Presidential visit prior to the Peking
                            trip. Next in preference would be a Presidential visit subsequent to but
                            announced before the Peking trip takes place. Less effective, but still
                            worthwhile, would be an Imperial visit to the United States before, or
                            again less usefully, after but announced before, the visit to

                        <p>A smooth passage of this major international agreement is of critical
                            importance to the preservation of political stability in Japan. This
                            suggests that the Administration should seek means of ensuring early
                            passage and opportunities to publicize awareness of its importance. As
                            the Senate debate nears, the President and high Administration officials
                            might raise this issue with important Senators and make the Japanese
                            press aware that this had been done. There is no point in attempting to
                            avoid negative testimony by Senators who feel they must speak out on
                            trade or other issues. What is essential is evidence that the
                            Administration is urging passage of the Treaty and that it should pass,
                            and pass soon. The Presidential message to the Senate, of course, has

                        <p>On the economic side it is difficult for the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"

                            the US the more difficult it becomes to remove it. In dealing with the
                            Japanese on this subject we might consider the following:</p>
                        <p><pb n="334" facs="0365" xml:id="pg_334"/>1. Leave the Japanese in no
                            doubt that the surcharge will not be removed until there has been
                            established a realistic realignment of currencies adequate to
                            reestablish equilibrium in world trade and payments system.</p>
                        <p>2. Encourage them, however, to believe that it will in fact be lifted
                            when we are satisfied that our trade and payments problems have been
                            solved and that Japan’s contribution to this is a firm offer to provide
                            a mixture of actions of the nature of those set forth in part III of
                            this paper adequate to bring our bilateral trade account into reasonable
                            equilibrium. In dealing with the Japanese it would be useful to have
                            them first announce a revaluation in the range acceptable to us and that
                            they would not undertake other steps desired by us unless and until the
                            surcharge is removed. Privately, they would agree to take these measures
                            when the surcharge is lifted. An arrangement of this nature would
                            achieve our objectives while permitting the Japanese government to
                            preserve the all important element of face.</p>
                        <p>We should not, however, attempt to use the surcharge as leverage to
                            obtain more than is possible. Revaluation and some improvement on trade
                            and defense procurement are about all that can be expected. We do not
                            expect a willingness by the Japanese to assume a share of the financing
                            of US local military costs, although this subject is under continuing
                            review within the US Government. Injecting the surcharge into this
                            emotion packed area of Japanese policy would already endanger our
                            security arrangements with the Japanese.</p>

                        <p>The major steps we want the Japanese to take are on the economic side. As
                            part of our world-wide effort to reverse our adverse balance of payments
                            position, we should continue to urge and seek to have Japan adopt
                            mutually compatible economic goals and to pursue measures appropriate to
                            the responsibilities of a major industrial country in chronic balance of
                            payments surplus. This means in particular the realization of a better
                            equilibrium in our bilateral trade. Cooperation from Japan in this field
                            is in Japan’s own interest, and would go far <pb n="335" facs="0366"

                            pervades some US business and political circles.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, measures to be sought from Japan should include the
                            following in a mixture appropriate to achieve our desired results:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Revaluation of the
                            Yen</p>
                        <p>Negotiations toward this goal should and are being carried out
                            multilaterally, which achieves the all important purpose of avoiding the
                            appearance of discrimination against Japan. However, to prevent
                            misunderstandings and to maintain pressure on the Japanese, private
                            discussions in confidence as the situation requires may be warranted.
                            Japan has already permitted the yen to float to a limited degree and
                            there are indications that the Japanese are prepared for a revaluation
                            of something in excess of 10 percent.</p>

                            promotion.</p>
                        <p>Next to revaluation of the yen, this type of stimulus to the Japanese
                            economy could be the most effective means of all in terms of improving
                            compatibility of the US and Japanese economies. Measures required would
                            include deliberate efforts to promote imports from the US, the reduction
                            of Japanese tariffs to the overall levels of the US and <gloss

                            domestic investment in non-productive areas. We should also seek a
                            change in Japanese policies and practices to permit US suppliers the
                            same opportunities to compete for Japanese Government procurement as
                            Japanese suppliers enjoy with respect to US Government procurement
                            contracts.</p>
                        <p>Such a program would not be easy for the Japanese. For the past twenty
                            years the national psychology has regarded growth in production and
                            exports as the ultimate good. Change is, however, already underway. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> is under heavy pressure to
                            correct the vast gap between industrial growth and the quality of

                            negotiations, has stated its willingness to make some unilateral tariff
                            reductions, and to dismantle NTBs.</p>

                            Nevertheless, it is an important long-term objective which faces
                            formidable obstacles. We will have to try to make the Japanese realize
                            how much these restrictions are resented by US business leaders.
                            American business increasingly recognizes the depth of Japanese fear of
                            foreign control over any major Japanese industry. While Americans feel
                            this fear is unfounded, the Japanese argue that the high capital/equity
                            ratio in Japan makes Japanese business vulnerable to foreign takeover at
                            a relatively low cost. Americans nevertheless feel that the Japanese
                            system confers non-reciprocal advantages on Japanese firms at their
                            expense. We should, therefore, continue to remind the Japanese of their
                            obligations under our Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, and
                            of the obligations which they have assumed to others as well as
                            ourselves in the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>. We should, of
                            course, continue to give normal assistance to individual U.S. firms

                        <p>For the short term, our interest would probably be best served by
                            concentrating our efforts in investment and business activities by US

                            however, probably room to expand this figure and the Department of

                            to combine efforts to develop joint ventures. These might be encouraged

                            Peking will doubtless be aware that, even as we seek to attain our

                        <p>We should not, however, overreact to this possibility. Peking’s reaction

                            should know, however, that we intend to maintain our security treaty
                            with Japan and our base structure on Okinawa. It also knows that we are
                            a military ally of Japan, that we have sold and intend to sell military
                            equipment to Japan, that we have conducted and intend to conduct
                            military exercises with Japan. This is a period when Peking will be
                            testing our will to maintain our Japanese relationship. It has already
                            begun to do so (see Hong Kong 6837 for an analysis). It would therefore
                            be wise to avoid any major new initiative with Japan in the military
                            field that Peking could justifiably claim is directed at Peking such as
                            providing Japan with an offensive capability. On the other hand, there
                            is no reason why we should not continue to conduct the kind of military
                            exercises we have conducted in the past with Japan, to sell equipment
                            for the defense of Japan, and in other ways to behave as we normally

                            Japanese, who have extensive trade, travel and other non-official
                            relations with Peking, would have little basis for objecting to any
                            agreements we might reach with the Chinese in these areas, provided they
                            knew about them in advance.</p>
                        <p>Much has been made in recent public analyses of the US-Japan-China
                            situation of the fact that the Sino-Japanese relationship must develop
                            apace with any Sino-US relationship if peace and stability in Asia is to
                            be maintained. There is much truth in this, but the Chinese have made it
                            very clear that they have no intention of dealing with a <persName

                            In regard to Japan, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                            stated, “I don’t want this ever breathed, but the Trading with the Enemy

                            added, however, “You’ve got to hold it out.” <persName

                            (whose name he apparently confuses here with that of <persName

                            of the October 8 meeting for the President’s file that indicated the
                            results of the meeting: “1) That maximum exposure should be given to the

                            solving this problem. Accordingly, it was agreed to give the session
                            photographic coverage. 2) That everyone should indicate a position of
                            firmness and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            agreed to continue to emphasize to the State Department the need for

                            should not go to Japan from Guam until a deal was confirmed.” (Ibid.,

                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that the conclusion of this
                            agreement was a great relief for him, to which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> commented that he couldn’t
                            say that events had always been made easy for him, either. He used to
                            suffer from the illusion that he was dedicated to the preservation of
                            Japanese-US friendship, but when he read the newspaper accounts from
                            Japan these days it appeared that he was portrayed as a villain.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that the
                            Japanese Government could not control the press—this was outside
                            governmental power. The same thing was true about the Japanese textile
                            industry, and this was why it had taken so long to conclude an
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> referred to the
                            President’s Peking trip, and declared that what we had to do was to find
                            a relationship of confidence between us. If the Japanese thought that we
                            were going to betray them, the situation would be hopeless. In fact, we
                            should be the ones to be suspicious, since the Japanese had many more
                            delegations in China than we did. In any event, we had no intention of
                            shifting our emphasis in our relations from Japan to China. The
                            President was also going to the Soviet Union, but this didn’t mean that
                            we would shift our policy in favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>, referring to
                            the fact that he was acting under instructions from Tokyo, expressed the
                            hope that when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            returned from Peking he would tell him what had taken place. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said he would of
                            course do so. However, a way had to be found to keep what he said from
                            leaking to the press. The information about his trip would need to be
                            handled in a channel that would not leak. This hadn’t always been
                            possible, but if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> could <pb n="342" facs="0373" xml:id="pg_342"
                            />find such a channel, there would be no problem. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> stated that he would communicate
                            this information to Tokyo. He had just come back from meeting Emperor
                            Hirohito and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> in Anchorage, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> had expressed considerable interest in Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s trip. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> assured Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> that he would see the
                            Ambassador a few days after his return. But he could tell the Ambassador
                            ahead of time that his trip would mostly be concerned with technical
                            matters and drawing up the agenda for the President’s trip, with very
                            little of a concrete nature to be discussed. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> accepted this, noting that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s trip had already
                            been portrayed as being of a technical nature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> went on to say that
                            of course some substance would be involved, but this wouldn’t go beyond
                            what had been discussed during his last visit to Peking. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked that if the
                            subject of Japan came up, could Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> emphasize the importance of the US-Japan
                            Security Treaty? This Treaty was, in fact, a big element in the security
                            of China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed
                            that he had made this point in July, and the Ambassador could be sure
                            that he would make it again. The alternative to the Security Treaty was
                            a re-armed Japan. There just couldn’t be a country like Japan without
                            security and without arms. The Security Treaty was to the advantage of
                            both of our countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> should not be
                            misled by some of the pious Japanese who went to China and said things
                            against the Security Treaty. He was personally against a nuclear Japan
                            or a re-armed Japan, and the Security Treaty was a safeguard against
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> stated that with
                            respect to the President’s visit to the Soviet Union, there was a great
                            interest in Japan over the triangular relationship involving Japan,
                            Peking, and the Soviet Union. Perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could visit Tokyo and express his thoughts on
                            this relationship to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> commented that he had offered to do so as
                            early as last July, but various things had transpired which had
                            prevented his visiting Japan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> mentioned that he had asked Tokyo to send its
                            fundamental views about the Japan-China-Soviet relationship, but Tokyo
                            had so far not responded. Perhaps after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s Peking visit, Tokyo would be better prepared
                            to address this issue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> declared that he was prepared from the White
                            House side to have the closest relationship with Japan of any other
                            country, and would be willing to go to Tokyo to tell people there what
                            he thought. The relationship would involve the US as well as Japan and
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, was Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> confident that by
                            May major US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> problems would be
                            solved? What about a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                            <pb n="343" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_343"/>agreement? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied affirmatively. Our
                            impression was that the Soviet Union was serious about solving problems.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked jokingly
                            that the real truth was that we were going to give Okinawa to Russia
                            before giving it back to Japan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> commented, equally jokingly, that this was indeed
                            big news. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said,
                            speaking more seriously, that he didn’t expect any Asian problems to be
                            on the agenda for discussions with the Soviets. This agenda would
                            address such matters as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, European
                            security, and so forth. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> thought the subject of a European security
                            conference would be on the agenda, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said, “yes.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> raised the
                            possibility that the President’s visit to Moscow would neutralize his
                            visit to Peking. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            remarked that we couldn’t let either communist country have a veto over
                            our relationship with the other communist country. We would not become
                            involved in the Sino-Soviet conflict, and he frankly didn’t care where
                            the Sino-Soviet border was. We did not want to become involved. When
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered
                            whether the Chinese and the Soviets might come closer together, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asserted that this
                            was out of our control. We would neither drive them apart nor closer
                            together. We would have to let them work out their relationship, and
                            would deal with both.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s opinion on what
                            would happen if, after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s trip to China, and if the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Chirep vote was unfavorable for us,
                            Nationalist China walked out of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that we
                            would naturally continue to maintain our relationship with Taiwan.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, would
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> make this clear to
                            Peking? This was a most important issue. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated that there was
                            absolutely no question of our maintaining relations with Nationalist
                            China, regardless if the vote went against us. The Japanese would not be
                            faced with any surprises in our relations with Taiwan, and if we should
                            ever consider changing these relations we would certainly let the
                            Japanese know. But there was no such consideration now, and none could
                            be foreseen for this term of the President. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained he was only
                            putting it in this way because the President’s present term was all the
                            farther he could look ahead.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> informed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> that we wanted to send
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> on an Asian
                            trip. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> was
                            being sent to attend the inauguration of President Thieu, but we thought
                            that he might take this occasion to visit Japan. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered, would Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> have full power to
                            negotiate on the exchange rate, and on economic matters? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that we were not going
                            to hit the Japanese over the head; we merely felt <pb n="344"
                                facs="0375" xml:id="pg_344"/>that while Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> was in the Far East it would
                            be useful for him to visit Japan. He had never been there before.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> indicated that
                            he felt some confusion over where to go to discuss all these various
                            economic matters. He had been told that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> had full power, that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> had full
                            power, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> had
                            full power—. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            interjected to say that he personally had full power. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> laughed. He observed
                            that the textiles question had been brought to a conclusion, but hoped
                            that we wouldn’t take this as a precedent for handling any other
                            matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> not to construe
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>’s visit as an
                            attempt to pressure Japan. We had the impression that one of the
                            innumerable Japanese emissaries had told Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>’s Government wanted to see him.
                            But Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> could be
                            assured that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>
                            was not coming to force Japan on the exchange rate. Another thing, he,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, would have just
                            come from Peking and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1"
                                >Connally</persName> could fill in Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> about this. Was this
                            inconvenient?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked when
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> might be
                            coming, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            replied that we were thinking of early November. The inauguration of
                            President Thieu was on October 31, and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> could get to Japan by about
                            November 7. He again assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> that we had no intention of using this visit to
                            force a discussion of something else.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3"

                            to come over the exchange rate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> again told Ambassador <persName

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>’s visit; we
                            just wanted him to get to know Japan and thought that the visit would
                            also be a friendly gesture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> to let us know by early next week if the visit

                            on behalf of the Japanese people that President and Mrs. Nixon had gone

                            on September 26, when they stopped there to refuel enroute to

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> also expressed
                            appreciation for the gracious hospitality the President extended Foreign

                            colleagues during the Joint Cabinet Committee Meeting held in Washington
                            September 9 and 10. All the Ministers, he said, were deeply impressed
                            and fully appreciative.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> expressed warm personal
                            appreciation to the President for the message conveyed to him through
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> that he
                            would be pleased to receive him (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName>) at the White House any time. He apologized for
                            any inconvenience caused by the several <pb n="346" facs="0377"
                                xml:id="pg_346"/>postponements of his visit, and explained that he
                            felt that it would have been awkward to call before the textile issue
                            was settled. He felt strongly that the resolution of the textile issue
                            would benefit the people of both countries.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his own appreciation to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> and his colleagues, whose efforts
                            had contributed greatly to the textile agreement. He expressed awareness
                            that the textile issue would now pose a political problem for the
                            Government in Japan, just as it had for the Government here before it
                            was resolved, but stressed that the settlement would now permit both
                            countries to move forward to resolve other issues important to both of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> agreed that there were
                            other subjects on which Japan and the United States should move ahead.
                            Personally, although he did not feel that the relations between Japan
                            and the United States are fundamentally bad, frankly speaking he noted
                            concern about the undesirable aspects of the prevailing mood between
                            both countries. He, too, was pleased that the textile settlement would
                            permit both countries to take up the other economic issues now,
                            including the monetary problem, but in light of our experience in
                            dealing with the textile issue he urged strongly that each nation
                            cooperate fully with the other to resolve the other outstanding economic
                            issues as smoothly as possible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2) Okinawa Reversion</p>
                        <p>The President noted his concern over reports that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s Government is facing a
                            political problem in providing the continued use of the land for the
                            American military bases in Okinawa following reversion, and asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> how he might help the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> meet this problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> explained that all of
                            the opposition parties oppose the Okinawa Reversion Agreement, but that
                            the Liberal Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>) is
                            united in its support of the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>.
                            Further, the Japanese people overwhelmingly support reversion. The
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>, which has an absolute majority
                            in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councilors, could
                            in any case force Diet approval of the Reversion Agreement, but in view
                            of the nature and the significance of reversion the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> wished to secure support from at least
                            some part of the opposition, perhaps from the Democratic Socialist Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_DSP_1">DSP</gloss>). As a condition for its
                            support of the Agreement, however, the <gloss target="#t_DSP_1"
                                >DSP</gloss> is demanding the return of some of the bases presently
                            used by the American forces in Okinawa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> felt that it would be helpful if the United States
                            could make known in some way that it would return some bases, not
                            necessarily in the immediate future, but soon enough after reversion to
                            accommodate Japanese wishes.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he would authorize Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> to discuss this problem with
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> during his
                            visit to <pb n="347" facs="0378" xml:id="pg_347"/>Tokyo. He suggested
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> could wire the
                            Prime Minister, on a private basis, that he is prepared to negotiate
                            anything reasonable, because he wished to help the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> gain as broad support as possible for
                            the Reversion Agreement. He said that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>, after returning to
                            Washington, could discuss the results of his talks with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. (The President excused
                            himself to take an urgent telephone call from Governor Holton.)</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> explained that the
                            President wanted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> to
                            know, on an immediate and private basis, that the United States is
                            prepared to be flexible in consolidating real estate after reversion. He
                            said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>
                            keeps fully abreast of this problem, and could discuss it in Tokyo; on
                            his return, the special requirements of the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> could be studied here and we would then try to work
                            something out. He cautioned that while we have bureaucratic problems
                            with this issue, it could be worked out slowly, over a period of time.
                            (The President rejoined Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                            >Kishi</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> noted reports that the
                            Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to conclude hearings on
                            the Okinawa Reversion Agreement rather quickly, but that the Senate
                            might delay a final vote until early next year. He warned that any
                            Senate delay beyond the end of this year would adversely affect Diet
                            consideration of this Agreement. The current Extraordinary Diet Session
                            must be completed by December 25, at the latest, to permit convocation
                            of the Regular Diet Session before the end of the year as required by
                            the Constitution, and the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> feels
                            strongly that it must complete the Diet approval process by about
                            December 20. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> cautioned
                            that Senate delay beyond the end of the year would greatly strengthen
                            the opposition parties in their determination to oppose the Agreement by
                            means of delaying tactics in the Diet deliberations.</p>
                        <p>The President assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            that the Administration would push for early approval by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> noted that the
                            Reversion Agreement might be reported to the full Senate by the Foreign
                            Relations Committee as early as November 2 or 3.</p>
                        <p>The President directed General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName> to inform Senators <persName corresp="#p_MM_1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SH_1"
                                >Scott</persName> of the need for early Senate approval. He assured
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> that there was no doubt
                            about Senate approval of the Agreement, and advised him to ignore the
                            inevitable statements which would be made during the Senate debate. He
                            reiterated his absolute assurance that the Senate would give its advice
                            and consent to this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked whether Okinawa reversion posed any other
                            problems beside land.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> replied that the <gloss
                                target="#t_DSP_1">DSP</gloss> has set two other conditions for its
                            support of the Reversion Agreement: 1) termination of <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broad<pb n="348" facs="0379"

                                Government used Okinawa as a base for <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"

                            nuclear weapons have been removed from Okinawa by the time of reversion.
                            However, he said that these latter two conditions were not being taken
                            as seriously by the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> as the first
                            condition, return of some bases.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1"
                                >Connally</persName> would discuss this first issue (land) with
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> with a view
                            to working out a solution helpful to the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3) Chirep</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>, turning to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, said that the <gloss target="#t_IQ_1"
                                >IQ</gloss> Resolution co-sponsored by Japan and the United States
                            still faced great difficulties. Although there is no clear prospect for
                            its adoption, he said that Japan is making an all-out effort to secure
                            its passage. He expressed the hope that the United States would also
                            exert its maximum influence on those governments with which it has
                            greater influence than Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that he had just reviewed the situation in an
                            hour-long discussion with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1"
                                >Bush</persName>. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> that the United States is doing all that it can,
                            particularly to persuade ten nations now on the fence to support the
                            resolution. He added that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> had asked him to report that the Japanese
                            delegation is doing an excellent job in New York to muster support for
                            the resolution. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> of full United States support, and said that he is
                            doing all that he can to influence the outcome of the vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> said that he himself did
                            not believe that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> would ipso
                            facto have to resign to take the responsibility if the <gloss
                                target="#t_IQ_1">IQ</gloss> should fail. Of course, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> took this consideration fully into
                            account in assessing the situation before deciding to co-sponsor and is
                            now doing its best to assure victory in the vote, which is expected to
                            be very close, because failure would place it in a difficult political
                            position. Since victory would be most helpful to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>, he appreciated the efforts being made
                            by the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> vote might
                            come as soon as next Tuesday,<note n="4" xml:id="d102fn4">October
                                26.</note> and assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> that the United States is exerting all the
                            leverage it can. For example, he himself has tried to influence some
                            votes by oral messages and telephone calls to some leaders. He
                            emphasized that it would set a bad precedent to expel a member by a
                            simple majority vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. If this
                            were done, no one could be sure when another country which had lost
                            favor with many other countries, such as Portugal, might be
                            expelled.</p>
                        <p><pb n="349" facs="0380" xml:id="pg_349"/>The President stressed his
                            belief that it is consistent to favor the admission of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and to oppose the expulsion of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss>. Support for the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> has risen through recent years until
                            now a majority favors its admission, but he reiterated that a dangerous
                            precedent would be set if a simple majority were to expel a member.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> noted his visit to
                            Taiwan just before coming to Washington, and said that Generalissimo
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang</persName> and other leaders he
                            met in Taiwan generally accepted the reverse-<gloss target="#t_IQ_1"
                                >IQ</gloss> Resolution and wished to see it adopted. However, he
                            added, <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang</persName> questioned him
                            very closely on the possible effects on Japan if the <gloss

                                >Chiang</persName> believed that the <gloss target="#t_GRC_1"
                                >GRC</gloss> has been a most loyal member of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for more than 25 years, and told Mr.

                            the humiliation of being expelled by the vote of those more recently
                            admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> who do not understand
                            the purpose of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and who do not
                            behave responsibly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            said that he interpreted <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1"
                            >Chiang</persName>’s remarks to mean that the <gloss target="#t_GRC_1"
                                >GRC</gloss> would voluntarily walk out of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> if the reverse-<gloss target="#t_IQ_1"
                                >IQ</gloss> Resolution failed, although, he added, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang</persName> did not say so in so many
                            words. <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang</persName> only told him that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss> is considering how to deal with
                            the worst possible eventuality, i.e., that the reverse <gloss
                                target="#t_IQ_1">IQ</gloss> does not pass, and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss> has not yet reached any conclusions on
                            its response to such a contingency.</p>
                        <p>The President said “let us hope we win.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> urged that both

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5) President’s Visits to Peking and Moscow</p>
                        <p>The President assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            that in any relations with Peking he has uppermost in his mind the
                            paramount importance of our friendship and close association with Japan.
                            He is aware, he said, of concern that the United States is seeking new
                            relations at the expense of old friends. That, he denied emphatically,
                            is not true. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            that we would continue to maintain close contact with our Japanese
                            friends through this period. He was sure that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> understood the great stakes
                            involved, and asked him to reassure any doubters that United
                            States-Japan friendship is at the top of the list if we are to maintain
                            peace in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The President assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            that the same is true with respect to his visit to Moscow. Further, he
                            assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> and his
                            colleagues that the United States would consult fully with Japan, both
                            before and after his visit to Moscow, on any discussions which involve
                            the interests of the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            is aware that his approach is very pragmatic. He knows communism, he
                            said, and is fully aware of the differences in our and their views of
                            the world, which his visits will not change, but, he stressed, the
                            important thing is to talk, not fight. He said that he is under no
                            illusion that his meetings in Peking will cause all the differences in
                            views and ideology to evaporate. Both we and the Chinese know that, he
                            said, and would meet to discuss areas where we could find common ground.
                            He said that he would not discuss anything, either in China or the
                            Soviet Union, except on this basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> said that the
                            announcement of the President’s visit to Peking had prompted the press
                            in Japan to conclude immediately that the United States would normalize
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, and that Japan
                            had fallen far behind. At the same time, the press severely criticized
                            the Sato Government. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> noted his own belief that normalization could not
                            be achieved that easily. Nations like Canada, with no special
                            relationship to Taiwan, could normalize their relations with Peking
                            easily, but countries like Japan and the United States could not ignore
                            Taiwan as Peking insists without disposing of their treaties and other
                            obligations to Taiwan. He said that he knows that the United States
                            would not do so, and expressed appreciation for this clear reassurance
                            by the President which confirmed his own belief that the United States
                            would not sacrifice old friends in its discussions with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><pb n="351" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_351"/>The President asked whether it
                            would be useful to consult with the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            about his trip to the Far East, either here or in Japan, in the same
                            manner he planned to consult in advance with the European nations about
                            his visit to Moscow. He felt that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> could stop off in Tokyo, if he were travelling in
                            the Far East about that time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> interjected that
                            consultations would be most useful. If the President perceived no
                            obstacle, he strongly supported the desirability of previsit
                            consultations before both the President’s trips, to Peking as well as
                            Moscow, either directly through Prime Minister <persName

                        <p>The President agreed that we would work out a procedure for
                            consultations, directly with the Prime Minister if he so desired, or
                            through Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>,

                                >Kishi</persName> explained that the main reason for moving Minister

                            Finance to Foreign Affairs in the cabinet reshuffle this past summer was
                            the belief that he would be the best man to improve Japan-United States
                            relations. Conditions within the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss>
                            are such that Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> is

                            no date has been decided yet) not just because Prime Minister <persName

                            situation requires it.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he too believed that Minister <persName

                            Impressions of Korea and Taiwan</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> reviewed his impressions
                            of the situation in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> and Taiwan,
                            both of which he had visited immediately before this visit to
                            Washington. In contrast to the “healthy, stable” economy of Taiwan, he
                            observed that the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> economy has been
                            shaken by three events this year: (1) devaluation of the won, (2) the
                            President’s dollar defense program announced August 15, and (3) the
                            floating of the yen by Japan. As a further element of instability he
                            noted the high degree of dependence of the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> economy on foreign loans. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss>, he said, is giving the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> all the aid it can, as indeed it should.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> then noted the
                            widespread impression in Japan that a “peace mood” prevails in Korea as
                            a result of the opening of the North <pb n="352" facs="0383"

                            relocate members of families who have been separated. In fact, however,
                            he found no such peace mood in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>:
                            North Korea has recently stepped up its infiltration of armed
                            guerrillas; <persName corresp="#p_KII_1">Kim Il-sung</persName>
                            continues to train even North Korean women and children in the use of
                            arms; the Soviets and Chinese Communists continue to supply arms aid to
                            North Korea, which is itself making great progress in developing an
                            indigenous arms industry; and the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                            air force is not necessarily superior to the North Korean. Consequently
                            he found a great deal of uncertainty in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss>, which is heightened by the withdrawal of half the
                            American forces and the fear that the remaining half might also be
                            withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> said that he had been
                            told that North Korean agents recently infiltrating into the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> are armed with poisoned needles,
                            rather than pistols or knives, which could be used to assassinate key
                            leaders (the poison is fatal in two hours) or to commit suicide in case
                            of capture.</p>
                        <p>Despite <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> statements that it will
                            liberate the island by armed invasion across the straits, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> found Taiwan calm. In contrast he
                            found the South Koreans apprehensive about the North Koreans from whom
                            they are separated only by the 38° parallel, and not a strait. He said
                            they well remember the invasion of 1950.</p>
                        <p>The President said that discussions like this with his old friend of many
                            years are most helpful. He suggested that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> talk freely about these subjects
                            with the other ten or twelve guests at dinner at the White House later

                            consult his wishes and then extend an official invitation. Oriental
                            etiquette, he explained, would require a prior visit to the United

                            Japan’s indebtedness to the United States for its great post-war

                                substituted language which would have the President take note of
                                recent progress in removing frictions from our relationship and
                                reaffirms the primary importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship in

                        <p>196864. For the Ambassador from the Secretary. Following is the text of a
                            message from the President to be delivered to Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Dear Mr. Prime Minister: I know that you share my disappointment over
                            the United Nations General Assembly vote to expel the Republic of China
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. I have kept in the closest
                            touch with all developments pertaining to the Chinese representation
                            issue at the <pb n="354" facs="0385" xml:id="pg_354"/>United Nations and
                            at world capitals and I am therefore deeply mindful of the full
                            cooperation and the tireless endeavors of the Japanese representatives
                            in support of our common position. Your own courageous decision to
                            cosponsor the United States resolution is one that is deeply appreciated
                            and respected by the American people and by your many other friends in
                            all parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>2. As we look to the future, we can be encouraged by the progress which
                            has recently taken place in the relationship between Japan and the
                            United States. Your leadership in resolving the textile question is
                            something for which I am particularly grateful. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>’s discussions with me last week
                            helped me better understand your views of current Asian situation, and I
                            hope that these talks were similarly useful to you. I am confident too
                            that, as I discussed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, our consultations on China policy will improve
                            our mutual understanding on this most important question. All of these
                            steps should contribute significantly to strengthening the alliance
                            between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>3. As always, you have my highest personal regards and warmest good
                                wishes.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">The message does not include a

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> began by confirming
                            his interest in making a visit to Japan. The Japanese press would need
                            to be kept quiet on this, but the visit was definitely on Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s schedule and the President
                            had agreed to it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> mentioned that
                            he had recently met Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s brother. When Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that his brother had
                            business connections in Japan, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> also had a lot of business there. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that his
                            brother was a great admirer of Japan, and that he himself would also be
                            a great admirer of Japan if only the Ambassador would get off his back.
                            The Ambassador seemed determined to have him an enemy of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> apologized for
                            having pressed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated in response
                            that he had wanted to see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>, who he assumed wanted to know what had gone on
                            in Peking. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            confirmed that this was his intention; he had read Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s backgrounder, but wondered
                            if there was anything else which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could tell him. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that he had described
                            the make-up of the Peking party in the backgrounder, which was
                            three-quarters technical. It had looked into such things as how to
                            communicate between Washington and Peking while the President was there
                            in Peking. This would be a terrible problem. In addition we needed to
                            set up communications for the press. A lot of things which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> could settle between
                            themselves here were still a problem in Peking. He had had to explain to
                            the Chinese why we needed so many people in the Presidential party,
                            several hundred, in fact, with so much press, so many telephones, etc.
                            To us, this was not earth-shaking, but the largest party the Chinese had
                            had before was 40, and we were taking several hundred. They had never
                            before had anyone arrive in more than one airplane. Thus, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> could see the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>On substance, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            noted, the Chinese went again through much of what they had gone through
                            in July. With respect to Japan, he himself had made a strong pitch on
                            the continuing US-Japanese alliance and the fact that the Mutual
                            Security Treaty remained in full force. Nothing could happen to this as
                            a result of the Peking trip. We placed the greatest emphasis on the
                            Treaty, and as he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> before, we would not give up our relationship
                            with Japan to please our opponents. He had told the Chinese that we
                            wouldn’t give up our friendship with Japan, and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> could assure his Prime Minister
                            that there would be nothing coming out of the President’s visit which
                            could be taken in the slightest <pb n="356" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_356"
                            />way as a criticism of Japan, implied or otherwise, even though the
                            Chinese for their part had expressed privately their feelings over the
                            possibility of Japanese expansion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wanted to know
                            whom Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had dealt
                            with in general—was it <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> confirmed that he had dealt with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> and the Acting Foreign
                            Minister. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            asked the name of the Acting Foreign Minister, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName> noted that it was Chi
                            P’eng-fei.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            indicated that the discussion had indeed been a general one. With the
                            President going to Peking, we had had no interest in making the
                            discussions more specific. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> asked, did the question of the agenda for the
                            President’s conversations come up? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that they would probably insist on
                            discussing Taiwan, but the Ambassador could be assured again that we
                            would not agree to anything that would impair our commitment to anybody.
                            Even if Taiwan were discussed, we would not give up our defense
                            commitment to Taiwan. There would be no cataclysmic changes in our
                            friendships.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> referred to what
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had said about his
                            not discussing third countries in Peking. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we would not
                            try to settle the Vietnam war with Peking, and while they obviously
                            would want to discuss the war, the emphasis throughout would be on
                            bilateral issues. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> assumed that one of these issues would be how to
                            normalize US-<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, and added
                            that another point was how we might continue the US-<gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relationship.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> raised the
                            question of whether economic matters had been discussed, or were these
                            not so important? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            jokingly remarked that on economic matters the Japanese were getting all
                            the bonuses. We were being accused of betrayal while Japan was cornering
                            the China market. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> denied that Japan was trying to corner this
                            market. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> went on to
                            say that economics had not been the principal item discussed. It had
                            been raised to some extent, but not much.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, had
                            cultural matters and the exchange of persons been discussed? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said, “yes.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that the President’s visit to Peking was too much of an event
                            just to stick to a discussion of bilateral relations. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that we would, of
                            course, discuss general views of the world, but the settlement of
                            bilateral affairs would take precedence.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> inquired about
                            the timing of the President’s visit—would March be the date? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that the
                            date would be selected very soon.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> surmised that
                            the Soviet Union had certainly been discussed by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and the Chinese in Peking.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> dismissed this by
                            saying that the Chinese problems with the Soviets were of no concern to
                            us, and vice versa. The biggest Sino-Soviet problems were ideological,
                            and there was also a border dispute. We didn’t care where the border
                            should be, and would not get involved. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered whether this had really
                            been made clear?</p>
                        <p>Of course, the Chinese views of the Soviets were of a different nature.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that we
                            all had an interest in a peaceful Soviet Union as well as in a peaceful
                            China, but the location of the border was their affair—whether the
                            Ussuri River or some place else. Did the Japanese have an opinion on
                            this? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            disclaimed any interest in the border situation. He wanted to know,
                            though, whether the Chinese were trying to find a peaceful solution with
                            the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            stated that they indeed were. If a war started, it would not be by the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> felt that the
                            Chinese would be unwilling to give up their political and ideological
                            position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed.
                            It was his guess that Sino-Soviet relations would remain rather cool. It
                            was almost inconceivable that a Sino-Soviet conflict would be provoked
                            by Peking. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            jokingly observed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> should be the one to go to Peking. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> always attacked
                            frontally, while he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, used an oblique approach. He followed the
                            Asian way, once he understood it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> laughed, and
                            said that he would like to ask one last question about the Soviet Union.
                            Were the Chinese very afraid about a military attack? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that this was his
                            impression. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            expressed the view that the Chinese were living under constant pressure,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that
                            this was also his impression.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered whether
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had any
                            impressions of the domestic political situation in the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asserted that he couldn’t tell—he had seen
                            nothing which proved one thing or another. As far as the leaders whom he
                            had met were concerned, there had been no change since last summer.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> appeared to be in
                            complete control, and with respect to the foreign <pb n="358"
                                facs="0389" xml:id="pg_358"/>policy part of the President’s visit,
                            while he had said before that he had to check with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao</persName>, this time, except for one item,
                            he always made the decision himself. He had made a big point of putting
                            us on public display, and we had been accompanied not simply by protocol
                            personnel but by senior members of the Government and Party such as Yeh
                            Chien-ying. Yeh had met him, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, at the airport; had taken him to Peking opera
                            where he had applauded him and other members of the U.S. party; and had
                            taken him to the Summer Place [<hi rend="italic">Palace</hi>?].
                            Everywhere he and the party had gone, people could see that they were
                            being escorted by senior personnel. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> found it very interesting that
                            the Chinese people could see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> together with such senior Chinese leaders. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> jokingly
                            attributed this to his charming personality.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wanted
                            confirmation of the fact that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> hadn’t known of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> voting before he left Peking. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that the voting
                            had taken place at the precise moment he had left Peking. The party had
                            departed from the guest house at 9:30 a.m., and arrived at the plane at
                            10:15 a.m., which was exactly the time of the vote. The Chinese had not
                            informed him about the voting, which was right because it had happened
                            just before the departure. He had learned afterwards that the vote was
                            completed ten minutes before the party had left.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> referred to the
                            fact that there had been some press play alleging that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s presence in Peking had
                            adversely affected the voting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> retorted that some of his colleagues in
                            Washington had not discouraged this view. However, it was a malicious,
                            outrageous lie. Why would we not want to win the vote? It would be
                            nothing but trouble to have the Chinese in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>, because they would do and say many things in New York
                            which could cause problems for us. We didn’t want Taiwan out of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and had established this
                            position weeks before. Despite the shameful stories being put out, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared, it could
                            be argued that his being in Peking would show that we could still have
                            good relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> while
                            trying to keep it out of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> referred to the
                            Belgian vote, with respect to which he had told our people that the
                            Belgians would never vote with us. The same was true for Cyprus. In
                            Cyprus, where the population was divided between Turks and Greeks, there
                            was no conceivable interest in dual representation; in Belgium, the
                            population was divided between the Walloons and the Flemings. We were
                            always counting countries which would never vote with us.<note n="3"

                        <p><pb n="359" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_359"/>Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> mentioned that some countries
                            abstained instead of voting in favor of the resolution, for example
                            Morocco and Chile. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            noted that Morocco was going to vote “no,” but the President personally
                            called the King and moved him from a no vote to abstention. Nobody could
                            tell him, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, that
                            what he had subsequently done in Peking could have affected the King’s
                            decision. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            questioned whether the Belgians might have been affected by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s visit to Peking,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> retorted that the
                            Belgians were saying this just as an excuse, and this was just a cheap
                            little stunt. The Belgian Foreign Minister was all right, but the
                            Government was too weak.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> observed that
                            the circumstances of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> vote and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s visit to Peking
                            had caused a lot of trouble in Tokyo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> explained that the timing of his visit had
                            been set when he thought that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            vote would probably be in the middle of November. In fact, he had been
                            assured by some of his colleagues in Washington that the vote would not
                            take place before November 1, and if it could have been held 5 or 6 days
                            after his return, he could have given the press a briefing to the effect
                            that the U.S. could be on good terms with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> while still voting for dual representation in the
                            United Nations. However, the vote had then been moved up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, asking Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> not to repeat what he
                            said, went on to note that he didn’t understand why there had been night
                            sessions, and nobody had given him an explanation of why the voting was
                            so early. It should have been possible to control that madhouse, and he
                            was personally outraged. He had wanted to win, and was absolutely
                            convinced that going to Peking could have been turned into a plus, for
                            example by explaining how well he had been treated at the same moment
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> was lining up
                            votes. He had had every intention of making such a statement, and had
                            received a written assurance that the vote would not take place before
                            October 29, and with luck, Monday, November 1. It was only while in
                            Peking that he had heard the vote would be earlier.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, would the
                            timing of the President’s visit be fixed soon? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that the date would be
                            picked by the end of the month. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> pressed on the agenda—there would, he assumed, be
                            questions of bilateral relations and a general view? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied in the affirmative.
                            He would let the Ambassador and Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> know.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> inquired when
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> could come to
                            Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that
                            he was thinking of December or early January. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked how he could be of
                            assistance in this, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied, “by keeping quiet.” Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> suggested that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> might be invited
                            by a private <pb n="360" facs="0391" xml:id="pg_360"/>organization. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated that this
                            was how he wanted it done, but he had the means himself to make the
                            arrangements, and would tell the Ambassador about them when the time
                            came. He did not want any press stories. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> assured Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> that there would be no
                            leak.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> raised the question
                            of whether it would still be useful for him to go to Japan even after
                            his most recent China visit. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> explained that people in Japan thought Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was such a “great
                            planner,” but if he showed himself in Tokyo he could demonstrate that he
                            was an ordinary human being and not a superman. As things now stood,
                            people in Tokyo thought that everything had been planned by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wondered how he could
                            demonstrate that he was not engaged in planning, to which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> replied, “by your
                            charm.” This would be a good thing for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, and it would also be quite profitable for him
                            to see Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            asserted that he would like to go, and let the Japanese people know what
                            an absurd position they had put him in. U.S. intellectuals attacked him
                            for being too anti-Communist, and our Japanese friends attacked him for
                            selling them out to the Communists. But he would try to come, and in
                            fact was going to come. Was Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s Prime Minister still going to be in office,
                            though? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said he
                            didn’t know. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> voting was a very
                            serious blow, and there had already been two no-confidence votes.
                            Nevertheless, if there was a real crisis, the Party would rally around
                            him, as had been the case with the Okinawa issue. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> did not want to make a
                            prediction, but felt that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s
                            position was assured until the Okinawa Reversion Treaty passed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if the
                            Japanese were going to ratify the Treaty only after the U.S. had
                            ratified it. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            disclaimed any such intention on Japan’s part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wondered whether
                            January would be a bad time for him to go to Japan, to which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> replied that January
                            would be satisfactory, although some of the Ministers might not be
                            available. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> then
                            remarked that he would come either in the first half of January or the
                            first half of December. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> said that the Reversion Treaty should pass the
                            Lower House by mid-November, and even if the Upper House didn’t pass the
                            measure, it would become law after one month. In conclusion, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> suggested to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> that the two get
                            together at the Ambassador’s house for lunch from time to time. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> thought that this
                            would be a good idea.</p>

                            Professor Edwin O. Reischauer of Harvard, our former Ambassador to
                            Japan, expressing his deep concern over the present state of our
                            relations with Japan. Citing doubt, distrust, and hostility toward the
                            U.S. which he finds building up in Japan and which he asserts could
                            strongly affect the next election there, he sees these two years as a
                            possible watershed in Japan’s relationship with us and the outside world
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>He recommends greater attention on our part to style and tone in our
                            dealings with Japan (avoiding the straight-forward, frank, tough
                            bargaining approach and relying more on a somewhat slower, less
                            unpredictable, and more consultative approach). He believes that a Japan
                            visit by you could be extremely helpful, but should not take place until
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has left
                            office. He suggests that you add persons to your staff having a very
                            sensitive feel for Japan.</p>
                        <p>In an attached statement which he planned to deliver November 8 before
                            the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy he
                            elaborated his concerns:</p>
                        <p>—The Japanese are in the midst of going through two great transitions
                            with us and the rest of the world: (1) assuming international economic
                            responsibility in their trading and financial relations that is
                            commensurate with their new-found status as the world’s third economic
                            power; and (2) adjustment away from assumed subservience to <pb n="362"
                                facs="0393" xml:id="pg_362"/>the U.S. in their political and defense
                            relations with us. (Professor Reischauer suggests that we ease this
                            latter transition by giving the Japanese a greater feeling of equality
                            in our political-security relationship, but makes no specific
                            recommendations.)</p>
                        <p>—These two great transitions merge and interact on the question of
                            Japanese reactions to whether or not the U.S. and other Western nations
                            accept them as full and equal partners. If we do not, the Japanese,
                            feeling discriminated against culturally and racially and rejected,
                            could revert to behavior similar to that of the 1930s.</p>
                        <p>—On the economic side, if trading blocs and heightened restrictions
                            emerged, Japan might react by attempting to reassert a more exclusive
                            economic domination over other Asian countries.</p>
                        <p>—On the defense side, if the Japanese lose confidence in our security
                            guarantee and in consequence we lost effective use of Japanese bases and
                            retreated to the mid-Pacific, Japan would probably rearm seriously,
                            which would touch off an arms race in Asia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Professor Reischauer has presented
                            something of a “worst case” projection of U.S.-Japanese relations,
                            probably out of his belief that the executive and legislative branches
                            are not sensitive to the drift of our relationship with Japan. While we
                            are certainly not out of the woods in our more troubled relations with
                            Japan of the last year, there is good reason to believe that this trend
                            has bottomed out. We are over the hump on the long-standing nettlesome
                            textile issue, and we will both have to tackle the remaining economic
                            issues with great patience, perseverance, determination, and
                            skill—although I think we should avoid further ultimatums. On China
                            policy, on which we probably gave Japan a greater shock than on our
                            economic initiative, we are in reasonably close touch, and I think
                            Japanese leaders are beginning to realize that the feared millienium in
                            Sino-U.S. relations is not just around the corner.</p>
                        <p>I would agree with Reischauer that we must continue to pay close heed to
                            our style in relations with Tokyo, trying to accommodate Japanese
                            sensitivities as they adjust to their new role in the world, and at the
                            same time educate them to be more sensitive to some of our unique
                            problems. Both of us can do this without compromising our basic
                            interests.</p>

                            reports on his meeting of November 1 with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>. The major points are:</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> asserted that we needed
                            reform in the monetary system and that we had no interest in going back
                            to the pre-August 15 situation. He added that there had to be a better
                            mechanism for changing exchange rates when that became necessary.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> indicated that Japan was
                            clearly opposed to floating rates but would consider revaluation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> stated that it
                            would be helpful if Japan were to lift restrictions on the import of
                            agricultural items, computers, integrated circuits, and aircraft.
                            Japan’s reported intention to double its defense procurement in the U.S.
                            over the next five years was also helpful.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said it would take time to
                            achieve the sought after turnabout in the U.S. balance of payments, and
                            asked what was needed immediately in the trade field in order for the
                            surcharge to be removed. <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName> indicated that, in addition to the above items,
                            a reduction of taxes on automobiles and the easing of various
                            administrative procedures on imports would be useful.</p>
                        <p>—The Ambassador’s priorities for action by the U.S. were a ratification
                            of the Okinawa treaty, removal of the surcharge, and an end to the
                            discriminatory “buy American” provisions of the investment tax
                            incentive.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese have not asked for reconsideration of the <gloss

                            The Treaty provides for review of this question after two years, with
                            removal to take place after five years if the Japanese insist. (The
                            Japanese would compensate us for the relocation of the transmitter.)</p>

                            visit, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>
                            defined Japan’s request vis-à-vis base consolidation as follows:</p>
                        <quote><p>—That U.S. facilities in Okinawa be reduced soon after reversion
                                by 10% in terms of acreage and numbers.</p>
                            <p>—That bilateral working-level discussions begin as soon as possible
                                before reversion, given the considerable preparations needed for
                                implementation.</p>
                            <p><pb n="365" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_365"/>—That the Japanese
                                Government announce during the current Diet consideration of the
                                Treaty that the above two considerations have been agreed to by the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> that our sympathetic
                            consideration of additional base reductions was premised on the hope of
                            further significant Japanese reduction of trade barriers, of which he
                            said little was so far observable.</p>
                        <p>With the Treaty itself now having cleared the Lower House of the Diet,
                            its ratification is virtually assured. The remaining problem is Diet
                            approval of the implementing legislation, the most important of which to
                            us is that concerning land acquisition for U.S. bases. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will probably use the fact of his
                            January meeting with you to try to lever this through before the
                            December 24 adjournment of the Diet, arguing to the Diet that with their
                            approval of the complete reversion package in hand he will be able to
                            ask you that reversion take place in April rather than July and that the
                            U.S. move expeditiously on further consolidation of U.S. bases on
                            Okinawa. If <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> does not succeed
                            by December 24, he will probably ask you to be more forthcoming on
                            additional base reduction after reversion in order to help secure
                            passage of the legislation when the Diet reconvenes early next year.</p>
                        <p>In light of <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s intentions, I
                            believe we should wait to see what the Diet does before adjourning and
                            what position <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> takes with you
                            at San Clemente, and then consider further action.<note n="4"

                        <p>After a brief exchange between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> concerning the Bermuda talks, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> remarked that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had been getting a
                            bad press over the situation in the sub-continent. The line had been
                            that both the Indians and the Soviets had gained. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asserted that the
                            Administration’s policy would prove to be essentially correct. If we had
                            been neutral, the Indians would have attacked West Pakistan as well. As
                            for the role of the Soviets, the Indians had no interest in being a
                            Soviet satellite, and would come back. As had happened with respect to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>, who had been
                            criticized for being too harsh, our policy would pay off with results.
                            We had had the choice between letting India destroy the whole country,
                            or of saying what we had said. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stressed again that the Indians had no
                            interest in being a Soviet satellite.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the subject of the San Clemente meeting, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> passed to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> a suggestion which had
                            been made personally by the President. Assuming that the San Clemente
                            talks would end around noon on the 7th of January, the President thought
                            that if Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> so
                            desired the President would invite the Prime Minister and a few others
                            of his party to fly with him to Palm Springs that afternoon. The
                            President had in mind that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>, and the Finance Minister might accompany Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. On our side would
                            be Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>, and perhaps Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p>They would go to the home of Ambassador Annenberg, play two foursomes of
                            golf, have a friendly working dinner followed by a social <pb n="367"
                                facs="0398" xml:id="pg_367"/>evening, and leave the morning of the
                            8th. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that
                            the Annenberg estate was a beautiful place—very big, and very well
                            arranged.</p>
                        <p>At this, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            wondered what kind of business Ambassador Annenberg was engaged in. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that
                            Ambassador Annenberg was the owner and publisher of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Philadelphia Inquirer,</hi> and was a very rich man.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> went on to note
                            that the President’s thought in inviting Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to a nice social affair of this
                            sort was that it would provide the Prime Minister with something extra
                            which had not been given to the other heads of state or government. It
                            would make the Prime Minister the only head of government with whom the
                            President had ever played golf. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> indicated that it was an easy flight over from
                            San Clemente, and the party could either be brought back that night or
                            stay over until the next day. This question could be settled later.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> termed the
                            President’s invitation “very interesting.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that it showed the
                            President’s personal touch. As another example, the dinner on the first
                            night of the talks would be in the President’s private house. It would
                            be a small, private affair due to the smallness of the dining room. The
                            President was trying in this way to show his close connections with the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, would the
                            President talk to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> alone? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied affirmatively, adding that he himself
                            was usually present. If this was the case, one additional person from
                            the Japanese side could be present. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> queried whether this additional
                            person might be Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> should talk to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, who would be present
                            in San Clemente for this purpose. The additional Japanese could be an
                            aide to the Prime Minister. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> noted that in such an event Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> might appoint him,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>. However, this
                            could embarrass the American side with respect to the U.S. Ambassador in
                            Tokyo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> expressed
                            confidence that the Japanese could find someone appropriate, although
                            depending on who was named he personally might not sit in. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> did, in fact, usually sit
                            in, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            replied, “yes,” because he knew the details. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that when he returned from
                            his visit to Tokyo he would bring back a suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that the
                            Japanese Finance Minister would meet with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>, and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> pointed out that in addition to
                            the Japanese Finance Minister, their Minister of International Trade and
                            Industry would also be attending. In that case, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated, both could talk to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">Kennedy</persName> was also <pb n="368"
                                facs="0399" xml:id="pg_368"/>coming, and could sit in with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> would bring <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM_1">Marshall Green</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked, how many
                            thousands of press people were the Japanese bringing? Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> jokingly referred to
                            possibly two or three thousand. More seriously, he speculated that there
                            might be around 70 Japanese reporters. A large group would be coming
                            with the Prime Minister, and some might join from Washington. He
                            anticipated far more problems in taking care of these press people than
                            he did with the official party.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> wondered, while
                            the President was talking to the Prime Minister, would the others be
                            sitting in another room? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied that the President would probably talk
                            to the Prime Minister in his own house, and the others would meet
                            outside. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> was
                            familiar with the layout: there were plenty of meeting rooms which could
                            serve. If any problems arose in the President’s conversations with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, the others could
                            come over. There would also be one plenary session of about a half hour
                            at the end in which everybody would join.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked for
                            confirmation that the President would first greet everybody, which would
                            be followed by expert discussions, and then by a final meeting. Would
                            the U.S. Ambassador from Tokyo be present? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied affirmatively to
                            both questions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            speculated that the agenda for the San Clemente talks might include
                            U.S.-Japanese commercial problems, China, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, and a review of the Asian situation, particularly the
                            India-Pakistan conflict.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked, what was
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>’s view of the
                            India-Pakistan conflict? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> replied that the Japanese were firmly of the
                            opinion that it was not right for one country to try to destroy another
                            by stirring up an insurgency within its borders and then extending help
                            from outside. That was why Japan had cooperated with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution on the situation. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> expressed the view
                            that the Security Council session had concluded with “some honor.” Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> felt that there
                            had not been too much honor—the way the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> was going it had become a means of legitimizing an
                            accomplished fact. It was helping the aggressor, and that was the reason
                            we had taken our own position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> not to worry about the Indians, who didn’t want
                            India to be a satellite. He remarked wryly that the Indians had bought
                            $300 million worth of Soviet weapons while we had given them $10 billion
                            in aid. They would come back to us because their new satellite (Bangla
                            Desh) would be a nightmare. If the Indians held on to it, it would be
                            very expensive; if they gave it independence, it would become a hotbed
                            of radicalism.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> mentioned that
                            the Soviets in a brief period had gained influence, and might be able to
                            get naval bases in the Indian <pb n="369" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_369"
                            />Ocean. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreed
                            that there had been some gains, but we would have to see how permanent
                            these were. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            asked, didn’t Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> see
                            India falling into Soviet hands? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said he did not. What had happened would be
                            healthy for the Indians, who had treated our aid like a regular part of
                            their budget. Now, however, India had to ask itself what the U.S.
                            attitude would be. Six months from now the Indian attitude would be much
                            healthier and better.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> how he thought the
                            Chinese had come out of the situation. According to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, they had come out weaker
                            than the world had expected. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> surmised that the Russians had been trying hard
                            to humiliate the Chinese, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> declared that they had done so indirectly.
                            From this, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            asked, had Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            evaluation of China changed any? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> replied no, not in the long term. He had told
                            the Ambassador for months what our evaluation of China was, and the
                            Ambassador wouldn’t believe him. The Ambassador would see that there was
                            no chance of our moving our emphasis in our relations from Tokyo to
                            Peking. Indeed, it was more likely for the Japanese to do this than the
                            Americans. For ourselves, we had wanted over the long term to have some
                            relationship with the Chinese, but the short term was not affected. We
                            were prepared to be very frank in our discussions of China at San
                            Clemente, but we had to be sure to find a way for whoever kept tabs on
                            the press for the Prime Minister not to talk. This, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> believed, could be done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked, was there
                            any possibility that in the President’s discussions with the Chinese he
                            would ask if Peking was ready to talk with Taiwan? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that he was not going
                            to get into the details of the Taiwan question; these details could be
                            looked into in San Clemente. We could make an agreement between
                            ourselves that we would do nothing surprising with respect to
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> brought up the
                            newspaper stories to the effect that the U.S. would be withdrawing
                            forces from Taiwan before the President’s talks in Peking. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that we were not
                            going to withdraw any forces before the talks, and not necessarily after
                            them. No forces had been withdrawn since he, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, had been in Peking.
                            Besides, Taiwan wasn’t being defended by the U.S. forces stationed
                            there. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> remarked
                            that these forces were symbolic of the U.S. defense commitment. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that
                            these forces were mostly for intelligence, logistics, and similar
                            functions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that,
                            moving on to more practical affairs, Okinawa had to be included on the
                            agenda for San Clemente. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asked jokingly if the Japanese wanted to give
                            it back to us <pb n="370" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_370"/>already?
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> observed that
                            there were two points which the Japanese would want to cover. First,
                            they would want to see the reversion date for Okinawa moved up from July
                            1, which was the date the U.S. had in mind. This point had already been
                            raised with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that we would
                            look into this matter.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted
                            that we now had settled textiles and currency problems, and he thought
                            that we should settle the issue of short-term trade before the San
                            Clemente talks so that there would be nothing emerging from them
                            suggesting a short-term hassle. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> could be assured that if this were done, we would
                            do something with respect to Okinawa. We would look into such matters as
                            the size of our bases along the lines of the President’s conversation
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>. The details could
                            be looked into.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> raised the
                            question of a joint communiqué—would there be one? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said this was up to the
                            Japanese. What did Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> think? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> thought that it would be better not to have one,
                            since it might create problems. However, this was up to the Prime
                            Minister, and he personally didn’t know. He would ask in Tokyo. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> recalled that we
                            had had a joint communiqué with the French and the British; however he
                            didn’t know whether we would have one with the Germans or not. Again, it
                            was up to the Japanese and we didn’t care one way or the other.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> speculated that
                            the Prime Minister might wish to bring up something he wanted the
                            President to tell the Chinese in Peking. He wasn’t sure about this,
                            though. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> emphasized
                            that our intention was to have this a warm, successful meeting
                            symbolizing the enormous attention which we paid to Japan. This was the
                            spirit in which we approached the meeting. It would be the last big
                            meeting before the President’s Peking trip, and would leave no doubt as
                            to who our friends were in the Pacific. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> thanked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> for these words.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> received
                            confirmation from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> would be arriving in El Toro on the 5th of January.
                            He suggested it to the Ambassador that they might meet together for
                            lunch at San Clemente on the 4th. Learning that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> would be back in Washington from
                            Tokyo on December 30, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> then suggested that the two get together for
                            lunch in Washington on January 3 at 12:30 p.m. This wouldn’t be as good
                            a luncheon as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            had given him. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            expressed the hope that he could invite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to the Embassy for dinner prior to the Peking
                            trip. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> could bring
                            two beautiful ladies.</p>
                        <p>On his way out of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            office, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            expressed some concern over Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s recommendation that the <pb n="371"
                                facs="0402" xml:id="pg_371"/>trade issue be settled prior to Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s meeting with the
                            President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            reiterated as his “strong suggestion” that this indeed be done. In the
                            first instance, the President did not like to discuss economic matters,
                            and in addition, injecting trade into the discussions at San Clemente
                            would make it appear to an undesirable extent that Japan had offered
                            something on trade and had received something in return, e.g.,
                            concessions regarding Okinawa. It would be much better if the President
                            could treat Okinawa as a matter entirely unrelated to trade, since he
                            could then make some moves on Okinawa purely as a warm gesture of
                            friendship. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> gave
                            his personal assurances that the President would in fact act in this
                            way. The Japanese did not need to offer too much; even some fairly
                            limited moves would do. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> said that he would pass this on to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, bearing very much in
                            mind what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had just
                            said about how far Japan needed to go. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> clarified his position by noting that the
                            Japanese measures would of course have to be of some significance.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese view San Clemente as potentially of great significance to
                            Japan’s adjustment to a changing world order and a less comfortable
                            alliance with the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has
                            weathered a series of rough jolts over the past six months centering on
                            events in the U.S.-Japan relationship—China, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NEP_1">NEP</gloss>, textiles, and the Chirep debate.
                            Recent polls show <pb n="372" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_372"/>his public
                            support at an all-time low. However, the Senate’s strong endorsement of
                            the Okinawa Treaty and the prospect of this meeting have bolstered
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s position and eased
                            strains in our relations. There is also a general sense of relief that
                            the textile issue has been settled, and the latest assessments indicate
                            that the Japanese economy will adjust satisfactorily to the currency
                            realignment. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will
                            probably remain in office at least until the reversion of Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese approach San Clemente with a mixture of gratification and
                            uncertainty. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> hopes the
                            meeting will strengthen his hand for the succession struggle. His
                            objective is to preserve the cohesiveness of the Liberal Democratic
                            Party, now at odds over China, and to pass the leadership to successors
                            who share his policy views. <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> remains the immediate heir apparent. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> will look to conditions governing
                            the reversion of Okinawa for concessions to satisfy his immediate
                            political needs. He hopes to resolve our trade differences beforehand,
                            and to avoid a detailed discussion of trade and monetary problems. He
                            will also be keenly interested in prospects for your visit to
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, the focus of the meeting
                            will be your discussion of our intentions with respect to Peking and
                            Taiwan. The Japanese fear and suspect that we have made or will make
                            deals with Peking which, when revealed, will embarrass Japan and alter
                            the Asian situation to Japan’s detriment. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> will therefore seek as clear a basis as possible
                            for assessing the impact of our China initiative on our security
                            relationship, the future of Taiwan, support for the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>, Japan’s own prospects vis-à-vis
                            Peking, and how all of these affect domestic Japanese politics.</p>
                        <p>San Clemente will be a success if <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> leaves reassured that we understand and will
                            protect Japan’s concerns in dealing with Peking, and that there will be
                            future opportunities for similar consultations.</p>

                                U.S.-Japanese Relations</item>

                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Hugh Scott</persName> forwarded to me
                            recently a lengthy letter from Mr. Robert A.G. Strickland, an American
                            businessman long-resident in Japan who runs a bus line, restaurant
                            chain, and tourist agency. Originally having gone to Japan as a student,
                            having immersed himself in the Japanese scene, and having married a
                            Japanese national, Strickland evidences in his letter the deep empathy
                            he has developed for the country and its people.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Strickland is critical of the parochialism he finds in
                            the way Japanese deal with foreigners in their midst and
                            abroad—particularly the double standard they apply in what they insist
                            on from the outside world as opposed to what they are willing to extend
                            to the outside world. Strickland is almost equally critical of American
                            businessmen, diplomats, and scholars in Japan whom he claims are
                            isolated from the real society, and names former Ambassador Edwin
                            Reischauer in particular.</p>
                        <p>Strickland says he has been moved to write Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_SH_1">Scott</persName>, in the hope his views will reach
                            you, by the present frictions in U.S.-Japan relations. As a sympathetic
                            American with deep roots in Japan, he is basically concerned with
                            suggesting more effective means of dealing with the Japanese in order to
                            get our relationship on a more stable long-term footing.</p>
                        <p>Focussing on the areas with which he has had most experience—trade, and
                            investment (as well as immigration)—Strickland postulates that Japan’s
                            economic success is due principally to its comparatively free access to
                            the U.S. market, while it has restricted the outside world’s access to
                            its own markets. (He also mentions the decided under-capitalization of
                            Japanese business as an important contributing factor to this
                            success.)</p>
                        <p><pb n="374" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_374"/>Characterizing Japanese as hard
                            bargainers who respect strength and deplore weakness, who have developed
                            a competitiveness unknown in the U.S., and who will not give in so long
                            as they have the faintest hope of getting their way, Strickland offers
                            the following suggestions for ameliorating our frictions:</p>

                                all.”)</p>

                            <p>—The use of a “firm, quiet stand” with irrevocable, firm time limits
                                on negotiations in order to neutralize the Japanese tactic of
                                dragging negotiations out ad infinitum to preserve a situation that
                                is to their advantage.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2"><persName

                        <p>The Prime Minister, first of all, conveyed to the President the sincere
                            appreciation of <gloss target="#t_HIM_1">HIM</gloss> the Emperor who was
                            deeply impressed with the warm welcome and unforgettable hospitality
                            accorded him and the Empress by the President and Mrs. Nixon at
                                Anchorage.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">On September 26, 1971,
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and the
                                First Lady greeted Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako during a
                                brief stopover by the Japanese couple in Anchorage, Alaska. See <ref
                                    target="#d90fn10">Document 90, footnote 10</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The President said that the visit was a great occasion for us too, and
                            had left a fine impression in the U.S., particularly because of the
                            excellent TV coverage.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that <gloss target="#t_HIM_1">HIM</gloss> the
                            Emperor had been particularly pleased at his discussion with the
                            President of a possible visit to the United States. However, he (the
                            Prime Minister) has been “putting on the brakes” because such a visit
                            would naturally lead to an invitation to the President to make a return
                            visit to Japan, which the Socialists and Communists would certainly
                            oppose. Recalling the demonstrations in 1960 which prevented his brother
                            (then Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>) from
                            welcoming President Eisenhower to Japan, he said that he wished to be
                            certain that the President could indeed make the visit before extending
                            an invitation. He did not want it said that each of the brothers
                                (<persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>) had invited the President but
                            neither had been able to welcome him to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood and felt the Prime Minister was
                            acting wisely. He noted that all the advanced countries, including the
                            United States and Japan, had similar problems with unpleasant radical
                            minorities. However, he pointed out, the majority of Americans have been
                            deeply impressed by the visit of <gloss target="#t_HIM_1">HIM</gloss>
                            the Emperor, and by the Prime Minister, and are favorably inclined
                            toward Japan.</p>

                        <p>An example of the favorable attitude toward Japan, the President said,
                            was the speedy Senate approval of the Okinawa Agreement, in the absence
                            of any of the opposition indicated earlier.<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3"

                                the Senate. The Senate approved the agreement on November 10,
                                84–6.</note></p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed deep appreciation for all the President had
                            done to insure the smooth approval of the Okinawan Reversion Agreement.
                            Noting that he and the President would discuss Oki<pb n="376"
                                facs="0407" xml:id="pg_376"/>nawa in detail tomorrow, he wished to
                            limit himself today to this expression of appreciation.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Prime Minister knew from his recent meeting
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName> in Tokyo
                            that he (the President) wished to have emerge from this meeting a
                            helpful announcement of our position regarding Okinawa. He agreed to
                            reserve detailed discussions for tomorrow morning, and suggested that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> might join in at
                            that time. He wished to work out an arrangement which the Prime Minister
                            could announce at his press conference following the conclusion of these
                            talks.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summit Talks—Present and Future</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted the President’s series of meetings with
                            President Pompidou, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HE_1"
                                >Heath</persName> and Chancellor Brandt, and said that he was
                            pleased to take part in the President’s first summit meeting this new
                            year. He lauded the President’s efforts to achieve real communication
                            with the leaders of the Free World, at this time when a new poly-polar
                            world is taking shape, and suggested that it might be desirable to
                            develop a more permanent arrangement for the leaders of the five leading
                            nations of the Free World (joined perhaps by several others) to continue
                            their summit-level contacts on a multilateral basis. If the President
                            had no objection, he said, Japan would endorse a proposal for a
                            multilateral summit any time the President might wish to make it.</p>
                        <p>The President, first of all, noted the concerns expressed in Japan that
                            he was meeting with the Prime Minister only after meeting first with the
                            European leaders. He assured the Prime Minister that he had no thought
                            of setting any one ahead of the others. What was involved, he explained,
                            was that he felt it was important to discuss European matters with the
                            French, British and Germans, and then to discuss Pacific matters with
                            the Prime Minister. One advantage of their meeting now, he said, was
                            that he could review for the Prime Minister the concepts developed in
                            his earlier meetings with the other three leaders.</p>
                        <p>For example, the President said, he discussed with the Europeans the
                            future course of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, our alliance
                            with Western Europe, of which France is still a part, and American and
                            European force levels in Europe. The forthcoming entry of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, and possibly other countries, into the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> was also a subject for
                            discussion, and, accordingly, so was the United States relationship to
                            this new European community.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the United States relationship with Europe
                            differed from its relationships in the Pacific. He said that he made the
                            point with each of the leaders he met (Pompidou, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName> and Brandt) that while we have a
                            responsibility to maintain the closest consultations between the United
                            States and the major European powers we must <pb n="377" facs="0408"
                                xml:id="pg_377"/>look at the world as a whole, which indicates a
                            responsibility to also consult closely with Japan. The reason he
                            believes this important is that in viewing the Free World, the great
                            economic powers, the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, and
                            possibly Canada, must consult closely if we are to build a stable and
                            productive Free World economy with trade and monetary stability. In a
                            geopolitical sense also we cannot view the world as two halves, the
                            Pacific half and the European half, but must view it in global terms.
                            England, France and Germany no longer maintain a significant military
                            presence in Asia, where Japan is the major Free World nation. Therefore,
                            he believed that the development of a 5-power consultative process
                            (adding Italy, perhaps, and Canada) would not only serve the economic
                            needs of the entire Free World, but would also contribute to the
                            development of cohesion in policy for handling all the difficult
                            political and security problems that arise.</p>
                        <p>The United States, the President added, is in a unique position, having
                            separate security treaties with Japan and the Western European nations,
                            but since its policy must be global the United States cannot separate
                            the two. Interestingly enough, he reported, all three European leaders
                            expressed great interest in having closer relations with Japan in the
                            economic as well as other areas. A bad situation would result if the new
                            Europe built a wall from behind which it could have an economic
                            confrontation with Japan and the United States, just as it would be bad
                            for the United States to isolate itself against Japan and Europe. The
                            President stressed his belief that we all must inevitably compete, which
                            is good, but must do so on fair terms. Therefore, he believed it
                            important to get the Europeans to think as we do in the United States,
                            that is, view the world as a whole, and to recognize that Japan must be
                            an important part of the Free World community. Chancellor Brandt, he
                            reported, explained Germany’s arrangement for semi-annual bilateral
                            consultations with Japan at the Foreign Minister level.</p>
                        <p>In summation, the President said that close consultations should continue
                            for the time being on a bilateral basis, but might perhaps develop into
                            multilateral consultations among the 5 powers later. In any case, he
                            believes that closer consultations are indispensable in the maintenance
                            of world peace.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said there were many points in the above with which he
                            agreed. He recalled Japan’s earlier alliance with Britain (1903) and its
                            joining of the Tripartite Alliance before the War, which he
                            characterized as a mistake. While Japan in the past may have presented
                            different faces to Europe and the United States, it now must present the
                            same face to both with respect to the path it is following. Setting
                            aside the separate matter of how the Free World might ultimately <pb
                                n="378" facs="0409" xml:id="pg_378"/>coordinate with the Communist
                            nations, he agreed that it would be most significant to develop close
                            consultations among the nations of the Free World. Apart from regular
                            consultations between Foreign Ministers, he supported the concept of a
                            5-power summit conference, as suggested by the President.</p>
                        <p>The President asked him to clarify whether he meant a 5-power summit
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister responded that he did, but with the addition perhaps
                            of Italy and Canada he did not feel any need to involve other countries.
                            In view of the President’s busy schedule, especially in this election
                            year, he thought it better to hold such a 5-power summit later, first in
                            the United States, the leading nation of the Free World, and then
                            subsequently in rotation in the other Free World nations.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the formation of the G–10 in the economic
                            area has worked out for the good of the world.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled that he was serving as Finance Minister when
                            Mr. Black invited Japan to join the G–10. The monetary problem had been
                            resolved, but he felt it would also be significant if the Free World
                            military powers could coordinate in the interest of world peace and
                            prosperity. He hoped the President would keep this idea in mind as he
                            moved forward with his visits to Peking and Moscow; perhaps he could
                            announce a formal proposal at some later date, not necessarily now.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this idea had some appeal. He recalled thinking
                            to the same end in earlier discussions of his summit meetings with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. In fact, he said
                            that he raised this point with each of the three leaders in his summit
                            meetings, that we could no longer think only in terms of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> alone as a separate matter, but felt
                            it important to bring Japan, the major power in the Pacific more fully
                            into the Free World community.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that indeed
                            when the President first began to think of his summit conferences he
                            considered a Big-5 Summit, but on reflection realized that he would be
                            discussing with Japan matters of no concern to the others, such as
                            Okinawa and Korea. For that reason the President decided to hold a
                            series of summit meetings, but had indeed initially given some
                            consideration to a Big-5 summit.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would consider the idea later, and would
                            pursue it after Moscow and Peking. He hoped that the Prime Minister
                            would also pursue it in his meetings with the Germans and the
                            French.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japan’s Position and Role</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that Japan has been limited to playing an
                            economic role in Asia, hopefully of some use, because it cannot play a
                            military role. He noted that during consideration of the Okinawa <pb
                                n="379" facs="0410" xml:id="pg_379"/>Reversion agreement and related
                            legislation it became apparent that strong anti-war and anti-security
                            treaty feelings persist, and even the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> itself has criticized the revival of Japanese
                            militarism. Japan thus finds it difficult to convince anyone that it is
                            not going militaristic, which is considered to be inevitable in view of
                            Japan’s great economic power. He believed that Japan’s present position
                            is correct, that it should not seek to become a military power, and
                            should seek to play a larger economic role within that context.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood the difficult position in which
                            Japan finds itself: as the third strongest economic power in the world
                            Japan must still depend on a commitment by another country, the United
                            States, for its defense. He felt it extremely important for Japan to
                            play the role it is, that is, an increasing economic role in Asia,
                            particularly Southeast Asia, for the more such free nations as Indonesia
                            and Thailand develop economically, the more difficult it will become to
                            overthrow them by subversion.</p>
                        <p>However, the President pointed out, Japan lies on the rimland of Asia,
                            with two great power neighbors, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, both of
                            which are military and nuclear powers. Japan’s <gloss target="#t_GNP_1"
                                >GNP</gloss> is twice that of China’s and is gaining on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, but with all that economic power,
                            and being linked to the economic fate of the Free World (even if it is
                            increasing its trade with Mainland China) Japan is naked before the
                            world in terms of its self defense. The United States nuclear deterrent
                            not only serves the United States, he said, but also Japan, under the
                            Mutual Security Treaty. He realized this presented a major political
                            problem in Japan, which the Prime Minister and his brother, former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>, have handled with
                            skill in the face of radical opposition, but it seemed to him that Japan
                            is faced with an unacceptable choice: either Japan develops its own
                            deterrent power however unpalatable vis-à-vis its neighbors, who are
                            armed with nuclear weapons, or it comes to an accommodation with them.
                            He felt that the Prime Minister is more acutely aware of this than
                            himself, but to put it into proper context he assured the Prime Minister
                            that his forthcoming visit to Peking would in no way be at the expense
                            of the commitments the United States has to its friends and allies in
                            the Pacific, Japan, the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> and
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled the speculation at the time his China visit was
                            announced, which he knew embarrassed the Prime Minister, that the United
                            States would move toward mainland China at the expense of its allies,
                            including Japan, but he emphasized that he has assured his friends, both
                            publicly and privately, that there were absolutely no conditions
                            attached to his visit.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister appreciated the President’s remarks about China. With
                            respect to nuclear weapons, however, he explained that <pb n="380"
                                facs="0411" xml:id="pg_380"/>Japan has adopted by unanimous
                            resolution of the Diet a policy based on the three non-nuclear
                            principles (non-production, non-introduction and non-possession of
                            nuclear weapons). Therefore, Japan must rely on the United States
                            nuclear umbrella under the Mutual Security Treaty. He suggested that the
                            President might respond to any expression of fear in Peking of Japanese
                            militarism that the United States would not provide Japan any nuclear
                            weapons, therefore Japan is not going militaristic. He also expressed
                            concern about the depth of American criticism of Japan’s
                            “free-ride.”</p>
                        <p>The President responded that this feeling is not directed only at Japan,
                            but Europe as well, even though the Europeans have more of a military
                            capability. Speaking personally, he emphasized that the United States
                            has a Mutual Security Treaty with Japan in its own interest as well as
                            Japan’s, which is true also of its other treaties with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> and Europe. Unless the United States
                            can justify these as being in its own interest, he did not believe the
                            public would support them. As a good politician, he knew the Prime
                            Minister would understand that as Japan’s economic power grew and as
                            Japan became more and more able to engage in healthy competition
                            pressures inevitably would arise in the United States for Japan to
                            assume a greater responsibility toward the defense of the Free World, if
                            not by direct military means, then through economic means.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that it is quite natural that Japan should play
                            a larger economic role, but in defense it has no other recourse except
                            to the United States nuclear umbrella.</p>
                        <p>With respect to economic assistance, the Prime Minister noted that
                            Japan’s aid now totalled .93% of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>,
                            close to the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>–DAC goal of 1% of
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, and said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> would increase its governmental
                            assistance to bring the total up to 1%.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Prime Minister noted that all five permanent members of
                            the UNSC are nuclear powers, but of these neither France nor the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> have signed and ratified the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. He asked whether the United States,
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> could persuade the other two to sign and ratify. He
                            also noted that Japan has signed the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President doubted that we had that kind of influence with China. He
                            did not discuss this point with President Pompidou, who in any case did
                            not seem ready yet to depart from DeGaulle’s policy, but he did expect
                            that France would sign at some future date. He did not expect China to
                            do so. He added that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> might have a different view.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> offered his
                            impression that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> attitude is
                            dominated by fear of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and
                            that the Chinese are reluctant to do anything which might be useful to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as blackmail.</p>
                        <p><pb n="381" facs="0412" xml:id="pg_381"/>The Prime Minister noted that
                            the discussion was getting off the rails of its principal theme (China),
                            but added that someday a way must be considered to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and France to accede to <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether Japan has signed the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that only ratification remains, which is being
                            held in abeyance until the problem of inspection is resolved. If a fair
                            system of inspection can be worked out, then this difficult problem of
                            ratification would be resolved.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Hot-Line</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, turning back to China, said there was no need to
                            dwell on the well-known shocking impact on other countries of the
                            announcement of the President’s visit. The Japanese evaluate highly this
                            forthcoming visit to China, but in simple words he warned that the shock
                            of the announcement on Asian countries ran much deeper than the
                            President could even imagine. He realized that full consultation on such
                            an affair would have been impossible, and even if informed, there was
                            nothing he could have done anyway. However, this event pointed up the
                            absence of a channel of communication with a major nation. Some time ago
                            he had agreed in principle that a “hotline” was necessary, but now the
                            time had come for Japan to consider its installation positively.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, and said that we could now implement the agreement
                            to install a hot-line, which would be consistent with what he said
                            earlier about consulting with the leading Pacific nation on the same
                            basis as with the three European powers.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">China</p>
                        <p>With respect to China, the President said that several steps are
                            involved. First, the decision was made to make the visit; second, we
                            were consulting and informing our friends before the visit regarding its
                            substance; and third, we would consult with and inform our friends as
                            appropriate after the visit. Therefore, he wished in particular to
                            inform the Prime Minister of the purpose of his visits to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, as he has done with the European leaders. Following
                            the visit, if desired by the Prime Minister, he wished to make
                            arrangements to inform him of the visit, and to present him reassurances
                            regarding our commitments. He now wished to name Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to follow-up on making
                            arrangements to so inform the Prime Minister. He also explained that Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has been present
                            at all the meetings up to now, and if the Prime Minister thought it
                            useful, perhaps Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            could explain the reasons for the visit and what is expected of it.</p>
                        <p>By way of preface, in a broader context, the President said the Chinese
                            agreed to see us for reasons of their own, and we agreed to <pb n="382"
                                facs="0413" xml:id="pg_382"/>see them for reasons of our own, which
                            sometimes coincided. Looming over all are US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>–<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations, and the fact that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> inevitably will become a major
                            nuclear power within 20 years. He affirmed his own belief that the
                            United States should attempt at this time to establish communications
                            with China and not leave the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            isolated in the heart of Asia, checked on the west by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, its ideological enemy; on the south
                            by India, with which it came in conflict in 1962; and on the east by the
                            free nations of Asia, extending from Japan down through Southeast Asia.
                            He pointed out that the great gulf in philosophy would always remain
                            between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>,
                            as long as they are Communists and we are non-Communist and have a great
                            difference in interests. We should, he urged, use our influence to the
                            extent that we can to discuss and resolve these differences, without
                            which there would be an inevitable confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that what would come out of the meeting is not
                            normalization, for there could be no normalization in the conventional
                            sense between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> because the United States recognized the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> and has a defense treaty with it,
                            neither of which it intends to change.<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">On

                                relations with Peking, therefore it is important that Japan not
                                again be ʽleft behind.ʼ” <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                    >Johnson</persName> advised, “It will therefore be most

                                could extend to our use of Japanese bases to carry out our

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan’s view is quite different, and he
                            asked how the President evaluated the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>

                        <p>The President replied that we opposed the expulsion of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, and of course are most grateful for
                            the high degree of leadership Japan exercised in this difficult
                            situation. We felt, he said, that a bad precedent would be set by the
                            expulsion of any <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> member, and did not
                            believe the expulsion of the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> over our objection could be
                            allowed <pb n="383" facs="0414" xml:id="pg_383"/>to change, or abrogate
                            our treaty with the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, or change our
                            policy of continuing to recognize the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed with him in that respect, but pointed out that
                            we could not ignore the fact that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> is seated in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that we accept that fact, because as a member of
                            the world body, we should accept majority rule. However on the other
                            hand we would stick to our national policy of continuing to have
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> and of
                            maintaining our defense agreement. In his view, he said, important as
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is, it could not be allowed to
                            dictate the policy of a great nation. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> is one world, and there the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> is the only government of China. Of course, he added,
                            there are other worlds, and there we have relations with the government
                            on Taiwan and are beginning discussions with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. He recognized that this seems
                            inconsistent, but the world we live in has many divided states, East and
                            West Germany; and North and South Korea. He found it interesting to note
                            that the one point on which the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> did agree is that there is one
                            China; their debate is which of them is its government. We believe that
                            in the long historical process this should be decided peacefully by the
                            two of them. Meantime, he said, we have a long history of friendship,
                            alliance and defense arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss> and will continue this relationship. At the same time,
                            on the basis he described above, we would meet the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> on a pragmatic basis to see whether we
                            had matters of mutual interest. In these terms, he did not feel that
                            recognition in the formal sense is so important, and did not expect to
                            reach such an agreement in Peking.</p>
                        <p>At the President’s suggestion, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that the President could hardly get out
                            of line since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            checks up on him every three or four days. In general, he said that our
                            assessment, as the President pointed out, is that China and ourselves
                            have been brought together, each for reasons of our own. Had the
                            President announced last year at this time that a United States
                            delegation would visit Peking within four days of bombing North Vietnam
                            and would receive a warm welcome he would have been accused of a
                            monstrous credibility gap. We do not have to give up our old friends to
                            visit the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, he observed, but we did
                            need room for maneuver to demonstrate that Moscow did not speak for the
                            entire Communist Bloc. He gave assurance that no friend of the United
                            States need fear that we would jeopardize their interest, especially
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt it necessary to discuss this subject at greater
                            length because there were points difficult for him to understand: the
                            United States did not seem to understand Japan’s position and Japan did
                            not understand the United States position. Obviously, more time was
                            needed for discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then explained Japan’s view. Japan had concluded a
                            peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, at a time
                            when it was not an error <pb n="384" facs="0415" xml:id="pg_384"/>to
                            select the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> with which to conclude a
                            peace treaty with China. However, since the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> adopted the Albanian Resolution, Japan must view the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> as the representative of China.
                            Still, no progress has been made in convincing Peking to talk to Japan.
                            With respect to Taiwan, both <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao</persName>
                            agree there is only one China, which therefore leaves Taiwan as a
                            domestic affair. Japan is attempting to normalize its relations with
                            Peking, but does not intend to abrogate its treaty with Taiwan prior to
                            normalization and feels that the handling of the treaty with Taiwan will
                            be resolved in the process of normalization.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister cautioned that a great problem would be caused by an
                            attempt to create two Chinas, or an independent Taiwan. Another point to
                            consider, he added, is that the Soviets would probably come into Taiwan
                            if the United States were to withdraw.</p>
                        <p>China is one, the Prime Minister reiterated, but he wished to hear the
                            United States view of the future of its treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, or whether the United States felt
                            that Taiwan represented all of China. Should the United States try to
                            push through this latter view he warned that it would be too big a
                            fiction. Should a separate Taiwan be created, apart from China, he said
                            that it would add another divided state to the list of Germany, Korea
                            and Vietnam. To recognize Taiwan as it is now would simply create a
                            great problem.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the Prime Minister said he found the United States position
                            difficult to understand, just as the United States might find it
                            difficult to understand Japan’s position.</p>
                        <p>Japan, the Prime Minister recalled, had no right to speak about Taiwan,
                            having abandoned all such rights at the time of surrender, but Japan
                            could say that Taiwan is a part of China, and that Japan has a treaty
                            with the government of which <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> is the elected head.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also hoped that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> would keep in mind the need to protect the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> seat in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and World Bank and other international
                            financial organizations in which it is seated.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this is our position. We are aware of the
                            difficulties of this problem over-all, wrestling with them as the
                            Japanese do, but, he added, there is one more dimension to consider,
                            since Taiwan is part of a defense complex to safeguard the security of
                            free Asian nations. Our treaty with Taiwan, he stressed, is also related
                            to this free Asia defense complex.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister understood this, and assumed it was related to the
                            President’s statement that he would not abandon old friends. He then
                            asked whether the President would open a liaison office in Peking during
                            his visit there, even if he did not establish an embassy.</p>
                        <p><pb n="385" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_385"/>The President replied that this
                            would be a matter for discussion, but there were no conditions as to
                            what might develop.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> added that no form,
                            as such, has been discussed, but felt perhaps that an emissary might
                            visit Peking from time to time, although no one knew for sure what would
                            develop.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the United States is considering an
                            independent status for Taiwan, or some revived form of the
                            Nationalist-Communist Common Front (Kokkyo–Gassaku). He also asked
                            whether the United States would agree to withdraw its forces from Taiwan
                            if the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> agreed not to liberate it by
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that there are possibilities there. Nothing,
                            however, could be predicted because these would be subjects for
                            discussion. He emphasized that both sides begin with the understanding
                            that what is not negotiable is the United States treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, or its recognition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>. On other matters, all he could say at
                            this time is what he has said in general terms about our position. In
                            the future, he felt, both governments would make adjustments. He
                            believed that he would stand firm on that position at this time with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Of course, he said, he
                            strongly opposed the resolution of the Taiwan situation by force.</p>
                        <p>To rephrase his views, the President did not believe the China problem
                            would soon be solved. As he said initially, to put this in perspective,
                            one of the principal reasons (not a secondary one) the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is meeting us is not Taiwan, which
                            while important ranks down the scale. Our reason for meeting them is not
                            Vietnam, although this is a special problem. Without knowing more, he
                            declined to speculate on the motives of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>, but in their view of history he felt that they see
                            themselves surrounded by a wall of enemies. The United States and <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> are not ideological friends, but it
                            serves the interest of both not to act as enemies. We disagree with
                            respect to the difficult problems of Taiwan, Vietnam and Korea, but
                            despite these, he said, there are other compelling, overriding reasons
                            for both countries to develop a new relationship.</p>
                        <p>For example, the President said, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> was firm in his discussions of Korea with the
                            Chinese, and as an indication of firmness we are adding $250 million in
                            funds for the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> to the budget which
                            will be published in two weeks, as a clear signal on Korea.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            budget would also make clear our intent to maintain the present force
                            level in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> through <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 73, not that we intended to reduce them
                            afterward, but our budgets are on an annual basis.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said the Koreans fear a troop cut after <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 73. In fact, he said, Taiwan and the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> are both deeply concerned, but
                            he believed this new budget would help allay their fears.</p>
                        <p><pb n="386" facs="0417" xml:id="pg_386"/>The Prime Minister also noted
                            that he had been approached by <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                            officials in Tokyo, just as the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has
                            been approached by the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> Ambassador
                            in Washington, to request that the United States not cut its troop
                            level. More than that, however, the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                            wishes to have Japanese assistance in building its defense industry, he
                            said, but Japan cannot engage in joint ventures to produce arms. He said
                            that the United States could help in this area.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that Japan could help in other ways.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed, and Japan is, for example, by extending $300
                            million in economic assistance over the next couple of years to help
                            finance a new subway in Seoul.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of Japan normalizing relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, the Prime Minister again said that
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> represents China, but Japan has
                            friendly relations and a treaty with Taiwan, and is completing all loans
                            to Taiwan previously negotiated. Japan is even prepared, he said, to
                            work out new loans, wishing of course to do so without upsetting
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>As previously explained, the Prime Minister said that Japan has separated
                            economics and politics in dealing with China up to now; it has political
                            relations with Taiwan and economic relations with both Taiwan and the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Now, if Japan’s normalization
                            policy succeeds, it will have its principal political and economic
                            relations with Peking, and only economic relations with Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt that he should also add that the position of
                            Taiwan has not changed in terms of the Mutual Security Treaty between
                            Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President felt he must make two points. First, Japan and the United
                            States are each sovereign countries and each must make its own decision.
                            Second, even though we lost the vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>, it was very much noted in the world and very much
                            appreciated in the United States that the United States and Japan stood
                            close together on this issue.</p>
                        <p>In Europe, the President commented, some Europeans with a deep sense of
                            history feel that France and Germany are competing on the road to
                            Moscow. He could not guess whether this is true, but in any such race
                            neither Paris nor Bonn could win, only Moscow. When his own visit to
                            Peking was announced there was, he knew, criticism that Japan had been
                            left behind, but he cautioned that if Japan and the United States were
                            to engage in a competition to see who could normalize its relations with
                            Peking quickest, it would serve the interests of neither. By this he did
                            not mean to say that we should do everything together. Indeed, he
                            recalled, in 1965 and 1967 he told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> why he felt that it was in Japan’s interest to
                            have trade relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. The
                            last thing we want to do, he avowed, is to normalize our <pb n="387"
                                facs="0418" xml:id="pg_387"/>own relations with Peking at the
                            expense of Japan, leaving Japan behind. Instead we seek relations that
                            serve the interests Japan seeks to serve, which serve both our interests
                            because of the security problem we share in the Pacific. We should, he
                            urged, consult closely on what we would do.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed emphatically that we should consult.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Korea and Okinawa</p>
                        <p>Turning to Korea, the Prime Minister reported that former <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CI_1">Chung Il-Kwon</persName> had recently visited
                            Japan to request additional Japanese economic aid, and to report on the
                            latest intelligence on North Korea’s plans, which could bear
                            watching.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, the Prime Minister noted that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> has recently required that all Japanese visitors to
                            Peking also go to Pyong-yang. The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            is now helping North Korea greatly, and North Korea which once leaned
                            toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is now leaning toward
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> military aid is primarily directed to the army, he
                            said, but North Korea is still dependent on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for aircraft and shipping, for
                            example new planes and the shipyard built at Seishin with Soviet
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister cautioned that <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>
                            fears are related to Okinawa reversion, but added that the Pentagon is
                            well aware of this.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that the point was strongly made in the Senate
                            during hearings on the Okinawa Agreement that the United States should
                            maintain its bases in Okinawa to meet its security commitments not just
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> but also Japan. We wished to
                            be as forthcoming as we could regarding Okinawa, but he emphasized that
                            we had no wish to be put in the position that those who supported the
                            Okinawa Agreement in the Senate would feel that we had not maintained an
                            adequate defensive capability.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> are now discussing Okinawa in their meeting. He
                            hoped to discuss Okinawa with the President tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he and the Prime Minister would finish what they
                            started.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indochina</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the timing is bad just at the end of the bombing of North
                            Vietnam, but the Prime Minister noted that the President had not said
                            much today about Indochina. If an occasion arose to discuss the subject
                            in Peking, he wanted the President to know that Japan would be prepared
                            to contribute to a special rehabilitation fund for Vietnam. However, he
                            cautioned, this should be established outside the <gloss
                                target="#t_ADB_1">ADB</gloss>, in which Taiwan is a member but the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is not.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed appreciation for this offer. The possibilities,
                            he suggested, would depend on whether an agreement could be <pb n="388"
                                facs="0419" xml:id="pg_388"/>reached for a cease-fire, the
                            withdrawal of forces and the return of all our POWs. Whether this matter
                            is discussed in Peking depends on the situation at that time, he said,
                            but meanwhile, we are pressing forward on the negotiating front. We
                            have, he said, made many forthcoming offers to North Vietnam without
                            success. He explained that the objective of the bombing of the North was
                            to protect our troop withdrawals, reduce our casualties and enable the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> forces to contain a North
                            Vietnamese offensive being planned for sometime between January and
                            March. He revealed that he planned to announce another withdrawal later
                            this month. While current intelligence indicated an enemy offensive in
                            preparation, he expressed confidence that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1"
                                >ARVN</gloss> forces are strong enough to defend themselves,
                            although he conceded they will lose a few battles and win a few.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that our activities in Cambodia and Laos are
                            related to Vietnam and Thailand, because if North Vietnam overran either
                            or both it would imperil the future of South Vietnam and Thailand. He
                            assured the Prime Minister that the Vietnamization program has
                            succeeded, and the <gloss target="#t_RVN_1">RVN</gloss> now has the
                            military potential to defend itself. American forces, he noted, are no
                            longer engaged in ground actions. He also assured the Prime Minister
                            that we are making every effort to negotiate a solution, including a
                            cease-fire, withdrawal and return of POWs. North Vietnam should agree,
                            he felt, because it no longer could expect to take over South Vietnam by
                            military forces.</p>
                        <p>It would be difficult, the President said, for either the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> to be helpful in Vietnam, because neither could fail
                            to support a sister socialist state.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had more influence on North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> influence
                            was predominant in 1964 and 1965, but as the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> began to furnish most of the heavy equipment between
                            1967 and 1969 its influence increased, and now is greater because it
                            provides more equipment. The Chinese, however, have influence for other
                            reasons, principally that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is a
                            big, neighboring country.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that the principle we are defending has broader
                            application than Southeast Asia; if military actions with the support of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and/or <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> succeed in overrunning another
                            country, with no reaction by the non-Communist powers, this would
                            encourage both to engage in such acts.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">India–Pakistan</p>
                        <p>The President said that we face a situation in South Asia in which India,
                            a nation of 600 million people with a democratic government moved
                            against Pakistan, a smaller nation with some 60 million people <pb
                                n="389" facs="0420" xml:id="pg_389"/>under a military junta. However
                            big and democratic India might be, if it swallows its neighbor with
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> support, the future of any
                            small country is endangered.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> involvement differed in each
                            case, Vietnam, Korea and India and Pakistan. In particular, there is a
                            glaring difference in approach between the two with respect to the
                            Indo-Pakistan conflict, which he believed could be exploited. He had
                            expected a protracted conflict, but the Indo-Pakistan war ended quickly
                            in a truce. While Japan wished to cooperate in providing humanitarian
                            aid for international relief for refugees, he felt time would be
                            required before recognizing Bangla Desh.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we take a forthcoming view with respect to
                            humanitarian aid, and the Congress is opposed to aid which can be
                            converted to war-like purpose. He agreed that it would be premature to
                            recognize Bangla Desh because it had not yet established a government
                            secure enough to give assurances of its survival. He said that the
                            United States would not recognize until the situation clarified.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> to keep in touch with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The President explained his position. Important as he considers India’s
                            survival as a non-Communist nation, we opposed its military action
                            against a neighbor to resolve a political question, not because of any
                            difference in philosophy of government, but because India’s actions set
                            a bad precedent. Therefore, we opposed India and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Perhaps, he concluded, lady chiefs of state are
                            dangerous, since both India and Israel have been led in war by
                            women.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt it was better when India was completely neutral,
                            but with Soviet support, and access across a land frontier India felt
                            itself strengthened against Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The President reviewed our attempt to work out a settlement on a
                            political basis, including $500 million for refugee relief, and getting
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAMY_1">Yahya Khan</persName> to agree to a
                            unilateral troop withdrawal, but India moved in its own interest.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> reviewed a study
                            which disclosed that the United States provided India some $2 billion in
                            economic aid since 1965. During the same period, India purchased $800
                            million worth of arms from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            and produced an additional $175 million itself. In effect, he concluded,
                            we financed India’s military build-up. During the same period, we
                            provided $50 million in aid to Pakistan, which received an additional
                            $100 million in military aid from the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>. This 10–1 increase in military capability gave India
                            an enormous advantage.</p>
                        <p>The President said this rendered ridiculous any charge that Pakistan
                            attacked India; it knew it would lose. It was India that attacked
                            Pakistan, with Soviet assistance.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that Thailand in particular depended on United
                            States assistance, and would be seriously troubled by a withdrawal of
                            American forces. He requested that assistance for Thailand as well as
                            Vietnam be kept in mind by the President.</p>
                        <p>The President urged that Japan not forget Indonesia, a nation of 140
                            million people in possession of tremendous natural resources, which
                            could serve as a great prize. He noted that Cambodia, which is receiving
                            assistance, differs from Vietnam where there is a civil war; actually
                            Cambodia is being invaded by a foreign power.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that the Rehabilitation Fund he discussed
                            earlier should be made available to rebuild Cambodia and Laos as well as
                            Vietnam. He agreed on the need to help Indonesia, where Suharto, unlike
                            his predecessor, is inclined toward the Free World and should be
                            supported.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister concluded by thanking the President for taking so much
                            time with him.</p>

                            Japan</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister began by asking whether Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> could stop off in Japan at
                            the conclusion of the President’s visit to Peking, provided of course he
                            didn’t have a stomach ache from eating too much rich Chinese food.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, in confidence, provided this not be announced
                            publicly, and instructed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to coordinate with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation, knowing how busy Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> is, and suggested
                            that it would be helpful to set a date. He agreed, of course, to keep
                            this visit secret.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that no public announcement be made of the subject of
                            the visit, which obviously would be China, since this would precede his
                            own visit to Moscow. He added that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could also brief the Prime Minister on the
                            latest developments relating to his forthcoming visit to Moscow, and
                            assured the Prime Minister that he could talk to Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> as if he were the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            latter half of March would be the best time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked the President to consider that he also would be
                            pleased to meet with the President at any place he might wish to
                            designate.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s visit would cause some trouble with his
                            European friends, but in view of the special relationship between the
                            United States and Japan he felt it would be natural to have him go. The
                            Europeans would be briefed about the Peking visit at the ambassadorial
                            level, he pointed out, but Japan would be briefed at the Prime Minister
                            level.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his approval, and inquired whether this
                            would be Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s first
                            visit to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that, with
                            the exception of brief stops enroute elsewhere, this would be his first
                            visit since 1962.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that consideration should be given for an
                            appropriate non-governmental group to extend an invitation.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that it would be desirable to have an educational or
                            cultural organization extend the invitation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt that (Fuji Bank Chairman) Mr. Iwasa’s economic
                            group would be pleased to extend the invitation.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that it might be better not to involve an economic
                            forum, lest this appear to cut across Secretary <persName

                        <p>The Prime Minister looked forward to speaking German with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, explaining that he had
                            taken his degree at Tokyo University <pb n="392" facs="0423"
                                xml:id="pg_392"/>in German jurisprudence. He also added, with
                            fervor, that he would pray for the President’s success in Peking.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">President’s Visit and Other China Matters</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that he had expressed some reservations about
                            the different positions of Japan and the United States vis-à-vis China.
                            However, since Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> is
                            arranging the visit to Peking, he assumed that everything would be all
                            right.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that he
                            has had extensive discussions with the Chinese about what is, and what
                            is not possible.</p>
                        <p>The President interjected that we have made no deal.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that all our
                            friends would see, at the end of the meetings in China, that we had
                            reaffirmed our commitments, and we would have no reason to explain that
                            we had made a deal. China knew our needs, and had no interest in putting
                            us on the spot; any uncertainties or doubts, he said, would soon be
                            dispelled.</p>
                        <p>The President, by way of indicating an important difference which bears
                            on our relations with Japan and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>, noted this morning’s report of the Chinese press attack on
                            him, not personally, but for the failure of the United States economic
                            policy. The Chinese are Communists, and we, like the Japanese, believe
                            in a free economy. He surmised that this Chinese attack was prompted by
                            some two weeks of Soviet press criticism of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> for its failure to criticize the United States, and
                            felt that it was significant that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> did not respond with an attack on his foreign policy.
                            In a sense, the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> had to prove its
                            virginity as a Communist power.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was not concerned with the differences
                            between Capitalism and Communism. Rather, he hoped there is no
                            difference between Japan and the United States on the abstract point
                            that China is one, regardless of whether it is represented by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss>, as each claimed.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated his statement of yesterday, that each nation would
                            have to make its own independent decision, but that we should consult
                            fully with each other with respect to changes of policy. Nor did he
                            think that the United States and Japan should engage in an obvious race
                            to Peking, because in that case neither would win, only Peking could
                            win.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed and said that Japan did not intend to engage in
                            any race. However, he noted that the announcement of the President’s
                            visit to Peking had come as a great shock. He himself understood that
                            this had not been arranged behind Japan’s back (over its head) but the
                            Japanese people did not share his understanding. Japan was ahead, he
                            added, in de facto relations, such as trade.</p>
                        <p><pb n="393" facs="0424" xml:id="pg_393"/>The President said that he
                            understood the problem presented to the Prime Minister, but emphasized
                            that the announcement of the visit was one thing, and did not involve a
                            change in policy; however, a change of policy would be another thing, on
                            which he would wish to consult fully.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan is the major trading partner of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, which must know that it should
                            have governmental contacts with Japan. He speculated that Peking is
                            considering now how such contacts can be turned to its own best
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that one thing
                            is indicated by our own experience. When the President first made his
                            initiative years ago through an open channel, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> responded arrogantly and demanded many
                            conditions, but the President continued steadily on his own course and
                            eventually the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> dropped all its
                            conditions. Our experience has shown that it would have been incorrect
                            for us in 1969 to have acceded to their conditions in order to open a
                            dialogue.</p>
                        <p>For example, the President explained, the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> demanded as conditions for talks that we get out of
                            Asia, get out of Vietnam, and abrogate our Security Treaty with the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>. We said no, firmly, and
                            refused to accept any conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked them with some energy for the above
                            indications, which would be of great value to him. The opposition
                            parties in Japan and private groups have all been demanding of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>, almost as if singing the same
                            popular song, that it normalize relations immediately. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>, he explained, could only continue, as
                            it had, to defend its own position. Since Japan is already the major
                            trading partner of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, he did not
                            believe Japan needed to bow its head. However, as the opposition parties
                            continued to demand relentlessly that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> bow its head to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> their refrain had gradually been taken up by the public
                            as well, and has become a major domestic criticism of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>. It is quite helpful to know, he said,
                            that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> attitude toward the United
                            States in 1969 so resembles the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            attitude toward Japan today.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that in
                            every meeting <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> always
                            followed the same sequence. In the first period, Chou always states his
                            own position in a tough and unyielding manner, but, acting under firm
                            Presidential instructions, he always replies in an equally tough manner.
                            Following this phase, Chou would always change his attitude and move on
                            to discuss other matters. Speaking not in ideological terms, but in
                            terms of human analysis, he observed that those who started their
                            revolution in the mountains of China over 25 years ago are tough and
                            hard men, and respect tough, hard adversaries; soft ones they swallow
                            and digest. He believed, therefore, that the way to negotiate with the
                            Chinese is not belligerently, but firmly, <pb n="394" facs="0425"
                                xml:id="pg_394"/>without giving away the store before they come
                            forward with something.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he could tell the Prime Minister privately,
                            without giving away any confidences, that his reading of the records of
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s conversations
                            shows that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> rates the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as its strongest potential
                            adversary. Japan’s policy is correct, if this is any indication, because
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> respects a strong, competitive
                            adversary, and it does respect Japan. If Japan were to crawl, or to run
                            to Peking, its bargaining position, he concluded, would evaporate.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the Warsaw Talks provided the basis for
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s visit to
                                Peking.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">The Warsaw talks, which
                                consisted of sporadic meetings (often in Warsaw) at the
                                ambassadorial level between China and the United States, began on
                                August 1, 1955. The talks received an impetus in September 1968 when
                                the Chinese Government responded affirmatively to a U.S. proposal to
                                resume them.</note></p>
                        <p>The President said the Warsaw Talks were just one part, and not the most
                            important; there were others, which were more important. However, he
                            added, we do not do business in public.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that while
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao</persName> exercised over-all
                            control, <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName> makes all
                            the day-to-day decisions, and he moves at his own pace. If pushed, he
                            will do nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether Romanian Prime Minister Ceausescu had
                            been instrumental in arranging the contacts.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was one contact.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister murmured, of course, there were many. He continued,
                            saying that Mr. Whitlam, head of Australia’s Labor Party, had passed on
                            helpful information to the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> in Tokyo
                            following his visit to Peking, but had declined to serve as any sort of
                            emissary. More recently, Pierre Mendes-France had stopped in Tokyo
                            enroute to Peking, and had received a briefing on the situation in
                            Japan. He said that he would not know until later whether this had been
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said that Japan has two major Communist powers as
                            neighbors. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, he felt, is more
                            concerned with Europe, and would pay little heed to Japan were it not
                            for its problems with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. With
                            respect to normalizing relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>, which the Japanese wished to do in view of their
                            historical relations with China, he said the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> would not act in haste, but neither did it wish to
                            delay unduly.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            looked to Europe, but noted also that it has developed an eye in its
                            back to keep watch on China. In fact, he said, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> maintains more divisions on its
                            China border than on its European border.</p>
                        <p><pb n="395" facs="0426" xml:id="pg_395"/>The Prime Minister suggested
                            that the President, while in China, might inform the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, as appropriate, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> desires to normalize its relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. It is ironical, he said,
                            that <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> politician Kenzo Matsumura
                            used to urge that Japan serve as a bridge between China and the United
                            States, but now the roles have been reversed. He reiterated his request
                            that the President, as appropriate, inform the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> wished to
                            normalize relations. Paradoxical as this seemed, he hoped that the
                            President would be sympathetic.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we believed it to be essential that we move
                            together on our terms, not theirs.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister understood, and said that Japan would not be too
                            anxious to normalize hastily. He suggested that the discussion of China
                            be left at this.</p>

                        <p>The President replied that he believed there would be one. In the <gloss

                            defensive missiles, while the United States has sought to limit <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> long-range missiles. He felt it
                            important that the Prime Minister know that we have been negotiating
                            realistically, without any idea of seeking an agreement at any price,
                            and with the firm intention of not allowing the negotiations to weaken
                            the deterrent capability the United States needed to honor its security
                            commitments in Asia (including Japan) and Europe. If any agreement were
                            to be reached that would permanently place the United States in second
                            place to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in nuclear
                            capability, he was well aware of the devastating effect this would have
                            on the world balance of power and on our allies throughout the world. As
                            long as he is in office, he vowed, he would never allow the United
                            States by virtue of an agreement, to take second place to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. They understand and respect power,
                            he added, and we intend to keep our power.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked a simple question: what degree of superiority
                            should the Free World maintain over the Communist side?</p>
                        <p>The President said that this is a complicated question. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is primarily a land power, while the
                            United States and its allies are both land and sea powers. Therefore,
                            what we need to provide an adequate defensive and deterrent capability
                            differs from what the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> needs; we
                            need more sea power, and they need more ground divisions. The test, he
                            stressed, is what degree of power is sufficient to deter the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and eventually the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> if they become a super-power, from
                            attacking any part of the Free World. Such deterrent power would, of
                            course, include all the Free World’s air, naval and land forces.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether it would be correct to say that it is
                            important to keep submarines on station in the Far East.</p>
                        <p><pb n="396" facs="0427" xml:id="pg_396"/>The President agreed that it is,
                            as well as maintaining air forces, and to continue the development of
                            nuclear submarines.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether satellites are also important.</p>
                        <p>The President said that on our part satellites provided helpful
                            intelligence, but there was no significant development of orbital
                            nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stressed his belief that the Free World must continue
                            to support a strategic deterrence, and maintain its competitive position
                            to the maximum degree possible. Beyond any question of doubt he felt the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> have an advantage in their ability to maintain military
                            power, but even though they can require their people to make great
                            sacrifices in their standard of living, there are built-in limits to
                            their power.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Prime Minister had struck a key point. Japan
                            is now the world’s third largest economic power, with a <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> 2½ times as great as the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Fundamentally the Free World is more
                            productive than the Communist world, and will continue to maintain and
                            widen the huge gap between them in terms of industrial capacity. This
                            industrial capacity would be extremely helpful if an arms buildup were
                            required. However, he said, our motivation is to work for an arms
                            limitation, and to avoid an arms race, since neither side could win.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that this is probably true. Technologically, he
                            said, Japan is dependent in this area on the United States, and
                            furthermore without an armaments industry, Japan must procure defensive
                            weapons from the United States. He asked whether there was any other
                            point he should know about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he had discussed everything we know at this
                            point. In March, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            could update this information, when he visited Tokyo, if there were any
                            new developments by then. He noted that an agreement may be reached, but
                            not before he visited Moscow in May. Both sides, he reiterated, are
                            hard-headed in these negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Burden Sharing</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan’s purchase of United States military
                            hardware contributes toward a better balance of trade.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, but emphasized that the scale of our imbalance in
                            trade is enormous. He explained that it would be most helpful if Japan
                            decided to purchase the Northrup F–5 jet trainer. Conceding that all
                            nations wished to build their own aircraft, nevertheless he stressed
                            that the F–5 is the best trainer available, and costs less. Of course,
                            as is the custom in these discussions relating to Okinawa, he reiterated
                            that there is no direct link with trade and other problems, <pb n="397"
                                facs="0428" xml:id="pg_397"/>which in any case he understood would
                            be settled satisfactorily next week.</p>
                        <p>However, in terms of the political situation in the United States, the
                            President said that it would be most helpful if Japan, not directly but
                            indirectly, could make purchases or other financial arrangements in
                            respect to the extensive military establishment the United States
                            maintains in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Minister of International Trade <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> is now discussing this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1"
                                >Connally</persName> would appreciate the Prime Minister’s support
                            on this.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that Japan’s 4th Defense Buildup is being
                            scaled down somewhat, but will include the purchase of new arms from the
                            United States. In July, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                                >Laird</persName> visited Japan, and while he praised the Self
                            Defense Force maintenance of its equipment, nevertheless he pointed out
                            its obsolescence, which brought home to him (the Prime Minister) the
                            need for Japan to purchase modern equipment.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3"

                            Strategy</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether Japan should move rapidly to ratify the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that each nation should handle this problem in the
                            light of its own circumstances. It is not a matter for us to decide, and
                            we respect the right of each nation to decide for itself in the light of
                            its own interests and its own desires. The United States, he said, is
                            not exerting pressure on Japan to ratify.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the President continued, Japan might take its time, and thus
                            keep any potential enemy concerned. He then asked the Prime Minister to
                            forget the preceding remark.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> if inspection is the only thing holding up
                            Japan’s ratification. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> replied that it is.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that inspection is very important, indeed. What
                            Japan should do about its own military establishment, he continued, is a
                            problem for Japan to decide, in terms of all its deep-rooted historical
                            and political ramifications. However, he pointed out, in his view
                            Japan’s position in Asia and the world would be strengthened if those
                            who might become Japan’s opponents were given cause to worry. For
                            domestic purposes he understood that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> had to <pb n="398" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_398"/>say
                            that Japan would not develop its military power, but in terms of serving
                            Japan’s interest in foreign policy he felt it better to cause its
                            neighbors some concern, and not say specifically what it would not do.
                            He recalled that President Eisenhower always stressed that it is
                            important not to tell an enemy what we would do, because he could
                            prepare to meet it, but even more important not to tell an enemy what we
                            would not do because it would encourage him to push us around.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the anti-war, anti-security treaty feelings
                            in Japan are deep-rooted. If the situation changed, Japan would wish to
                            defend itself, but the shock of the war is still deep and more time is
                            needed before a change could take place. This, of course, did not apply
                            to those too young to remember the war and its aftermath. At present,
                            Japan’s policy is to build its defensive capability in consonance with
                            its own national power and in light of national conditions. However,
                            defense officials could not at present postulate a hypothetical enemy
                            without being subject to intense criticism. He noted that the budget for
                            the Self Defense Forces is a bit less than 1% of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, the Prime Minister recalled the President’s first visit to
                            Japan as Vice President, on which occasion he welcomed him at the
                            airport in Tokyo. He also recalled the arrival remarks in which the then
                            Vice President advocated that the Japanese draw up their own
                                constitution.<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">In the fall of 1953, Vice
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> visited
                                Japan and criticized the Peace Constitution.</note> It is extremely
                            ironical, he observed that the Japanese Socialist Party which otherwise
                            advocates radical change is committed to defending the status quo of
                            Japan’s Peace Constitution.</p>
                        <p>The President interpreted this to mean that the Socialists wished to keep
                            Japan weak.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed. He commented that the younger people are
                            beginning to want to defend Japan themselves.</p>
                        <p>However, the Prime Minister stressed that all Japanese abhor nuclear
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then explained that considerable data on the atom
                            bombing has been returned to Japan recently, and put on display at the
                            Peace Museum in Hiroshima. Last year he said that he took part in the
                            August 6 anniversary ceremonies at Hiroshima, the first time any Prime
                            Minister has done so, and on that occasion he visited the Museum, which
                            made him feel even more deeply the horror of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he also saw this in 1965.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that some additional material is reported to be
                            still in the United States, and asked whether it too could be <pb

                            grounds that joint study of the material is best.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would look into this.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled a hunting story, that a sitting duck could easily
                            become a Peking duck.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister commented that he would probably have to take part in
                            the anniversary ceremonies in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in alternate years,
                            since it would be difficult to attend both every year.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his conviction that there are no American
                            nuclear weapons in Japan, but noted sharp Socialist and Communist Party
                            criticism in the Diet about the alleged presence of American <gloss

                            States could handle this issue better than it has.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that he

                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the United States has destroyed its stock of
                            biological weapons, except for a minute quantity needed for medical
                            research.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister specifically raised the code numbering system used to
                            identify ammunition magazines, 1, 2, 3, and 4, of which it was generally
                            believed that 4 indicated chemical weapons storage. When this issue was
                            raised in the Diet some storage magazines at the Iwakuni <gloss
                                target="#t_MCAS_1">MCAS</gloss> were hastily repainted, which
                            increased suspicion in Japan. He suggested that any code system is
                            acceptable, provided it is not changed suddenly in the face of
                            allegations.</p>
                        <p>The President assured him there are no chemical weapons in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President then suggested that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> reported that he
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> had worked
                            out all the joint statement language about Okinawan reversion, except
                            for the date which they left blank, to be filled in by the President and
                            the Prime Minister. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> had proposed May 31, but had also left room for
                            further consideration.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether some indication should be given of the
                            importance the Prime Minister attached to moving reversion up earlier
                            than July 1.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister emphatically declared that an earlier date would be a
                            great political plus. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> had
                            always hoped for reversion on April 1, even though this is April Fools’
                            Day.</p>
                        <p>The President responded wryly that we didn’t want to fool our
                            military.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that June 23 marked the end of combat on
                            Okinawa, and there were strong desires in both Japan and Okinawa to
                            celebrate that anniversary under Japanese administration.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that May 31 would be a good date.</p>
                        <p><pb n="401" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_401"/>The Prime Minister replied that
                            June 1 would be better, to avoid the technical problems (such as budget)
                            which would arise if Japan were to assume control for only the one last
                            day of May.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it is his nature to be generous, and having
                            checked closely with our security officials to see if it would be
                            possible to offer a better date, he proposed May 15, if that would
                            help.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister shook hands on this deal.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then reported on his earlier discussions with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> about the
                            possibility of returning a golf course and a beach to Japan, after
                            reversion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the golf course would not be difficult, but
                            the beach used by enlisted men could present a problem. Okinawan
                            reversion itself represented a big step, and we had to make certain to
                            maintain our military establishment in the interest of the security of
                            both Japan and the United States. Any attempt now to renegotiate
                            facilities would pose a political problem, and he advised the Foreign
                            Minister to be as forthcoming as he could about his reasons for
                            requesting such additional adjustment.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> explained that he
                            did not intend to name a specific golf course, or beach, or other
                            facility, nor did he wish to announce any agreement by the United States
                            to discuss the return of some facilities after reversion, but would keep
                            it in his heart. Such an agreement, he reasoned, would strengthen the
                            Prime Minister in Diet deliberations.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether this meant that the Prime Minister would be
                            better able to answer Diet questions about base realignment and
                            consolidation.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> answered
                            affirmatively.</p>
                        <p>The President thereupon committed the United States to an understanding
                            that we would return a golf course after reversion.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> added that
                            anything along these lines be done in accordance with the 1969 Joint
                            Communiqué, that is, that security capabilities not be impaired, the
                            importance of which he stressed.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">The text of
                                the 1969 Joint Communiqué is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> pointed out that
                            Japan might consider some alternative for the beach used by enlisted men
                            and again cautioned against renegotiating the agreement because of the
                            commitments given in the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> promised to bear
                            this in mind, and did not believe, in any case, that the return of
                            facilities even after reversion would be that easy to accomplish.</p>
                        <p><pb n="402" facs="0433" xml:id="pg_402"/>The Prime Minister requested
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> to give him a
                            detailed report of his discussions with the Secretary later.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> said that he was
                            well aware that any announcement about the post-reversion return of a
                            golf course and beach would accelerate the thrust for reversion;
                            therefore he intended to keep this in his heart.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister (reminding Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> of his political A–B–C’s) said that an early
                            announcement would gain face for the opposition.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> replied that this
                            would not be disclosed until later.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Prime Minister, if questioned, could respond
                            that we had discussed this, and that representatives of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had indicated a willingness to be
                            reasonable in working out something in the interest of both countries
                            without impairing security capabilities.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister again expressed his appreciation for the May 15 date.
                            The earlier the better, but he asked Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> whether it would be necessary to
                            explain why Japan would take over the administrative rights for half a
                            month.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> proposed to
                            explain this on the grounds that both sides agreed that they could
                            complete preparations by this date.</p>
                        <p>The President supported this reason, saying that we moved the date up to
                            the earliest one that would permit completion of the preparations.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> had discussed the reassurances to be given on
                            R-day on the removal of all CBR weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> replied that he
                            had agreed to transmit a letter to Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> May 15 confirming the absence of all CBR weapons,
                            along the lines of the testimony before the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> suggested that he
                            also might wish to confirm continued cooperation by the United States
                            with Japan’s nuclear policy.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed appreciation for this assurance, and noted
                            that he and the President had discussed <gloss target="#t_CB_1"
                                >CB</gloss> weapons earlier.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> said that there
                            are no <gloss target="#t_CB_1">CB</gloss> weapons present.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that suspicion in Japan had deepened when
                            certain code markings at ammunition depots were repainted by the U.S.
                            forces after the issue was raised in the Diet.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> commented that
                            American servicemen gave considerable help to the opposition parties in
                            support of allegations of the presence of nuclear and <gloss
                                target="#t_CB_1">CB</gloss> weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that anti-war groups seemed to be rather
                            successful in this area.</p>
                        <p><pb n="403" facs="0434" xml:id="pg_403"/>Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> turned to Naha airport and the
                            US Navy P–3s stationed there. The United States, he said, had promised
                            to return Naha airport to exclusive Japanese control by R-day (for civil
                            aviation and Air Self Defense Force use) and to transfer all the P–3
                            aircraft elsewhere. It seemed that these P–3s might be transferred to
                            Iwakuni <gloss target="#t_MCAS_1">MCAS</gloss> (located in Yamaguchi
                            Precture, the Prime Minister’s home district) or Misawa AB, which would
                            create the political problems he had reviewed for Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>. He reported that he had made a
                            request of the Secretary that these P–3 aircraft be transferred to
                            another base in Okinawa, not to mainland Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> replied that we
                            must consider this carefully, because while the aircraft themselves
                            could be transferred it is unlikely that the service facilities at Naha
                            AB which they require could be rebuilt elsewhere so quickly.</p>
                        <p>Along these lines, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> also noted the discussions of Japan’s purchase of
                            the Northrup F–5 trainer (which would mean much to California) and the
                            Grumman <gloss target="#t_ASW_1">ASW</gloss> aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> explained that
                            Japan has already invested heavily in its own T–2 program, and having
                            already produced two of these aircraft it would be difficult to stop
                            now. The <gloss target="#t_ASW_1">ASW</gloss> aircraft, he said, is a
                            separate matter, which he intended to restudy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> emphasized that
                            the F–5 had much to recommend it: low cost, availability now to begin
                            training pilots, and the fact that its purchase would help offset some
                            of our own defense expenditures in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> replied that the
                            Ministry of Finance believed that the less purchased the better, but it
                            is also concerned about costs and prefers the least expensive course. On
                            the other hand, the Defense Agency, which has already built two T–2
                            aircraft, favors its own program, even though more costly, as a means of
                            developing Japan’s own independent aircraft industry. However, he agreed
                            to give more thought to this problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            purchase some F–5’s as a transitional measure, since production of its
                            own T–2 would probably not meet the time frame for training F–4
                            pilots.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister suggested a deal: he would consider the F–5 purchase
                            if the United States would consider not moving the P–3’s to Iwakuni
                                <gloss target="#t_MCAS_1">MCAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> noted the existing
                            arrangements for coproduction of F–4’s in Japan, and the possibility of
                            training F–4 pilots in the United States. He felt that it would be
                            better to leave discussions of these aircraft to the business firms
                            themselves. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> This signal is consistent with

                            did not believe this is a subject for the political leaders to take up.
                            He added that he would review this again, in terms of the budget.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the joint press statement had been agreed
                                on.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">The text of the joint press

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> reported that it
                            had been, and thereupon proceeded to read all of paragraph 4 and the
                            economic paragraph to the Prime Minister (in Japanese).</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> then explained
                            that the substance and the manner of the R-day assurances of a
                            nuclear-free Okinawa would not be made public.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the United States could consider an
                            open-visit policy for responsible Self Defense Force officers to help
                            eliminate any possible allegations about nuclear weapons remaining in
                            bases in Okinawa. Of course, he said, this would constitute something
                            other than a formal “inspection” process.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> explained that the
                            opposition recently charged in the Diet that it had photographs backed
                            by statements by American servicemen to prove the presence of nuclear
                            weapons at Iwakuni <gloss target="#t_MCAS_1">MCAS</gloss>. At that time,
                            a senior Self Defense Force officer, escorted by his American host,
                            toured the facility and was thus enabled to report that he found no
                            evidence whatsoever of nuclear weapons in the facilities in question. On
                            this basis the Prime Minister was able to respond with confidence to
                            these charges in the Diet. This kind of messy political problem arose
                            from time to time, and it would be most helpful in refuting future
                            charges if after reversion Self Defense Force officers could say they
                            have visited the bases and found no nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> said the
                            Americans in question are desertees. In principle, we could not accept
                            inspection, but in terms of seeking a modus vivendi he said that he
                            would consult the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that recently some stolen shipping invoices for
                            poison gas, thinned down for training purposes, had been presented in
                            the Diet as proof of the presence of <gloss target="#t_CB_1">CB</gloss>
                            weapons in Japan. He had great difficulty in answering these
                            allegations, which were followed immediately by other charges that the
                            United States forces kept sheep at one base as a safety measure, since
                            everyone knew sheep were the first to die of leaking gas, and thus
                            served as a warning device. This turned out to have no basis in fact
                            whatsoever, but it indicated the kind of trouble he has been having.</p>
                        <p><pb n="405" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_405"/>The President suggested that
                            this party join the other Cabinet Ministers in a nearby room for a brief

                            Discussion therefore evolved as a series of responses to <persName

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> opened with an expression
                            of warm appreciation for the President’s personal message sent from the
                            aircraft enroute home. I responded that my visit to Japan was undertaken
                            at the specific request of the President and that he had asked me to
                            extend his warmest wishes and regards to Prime Minister <persName

                            as expressed at San Clemente, that U.S.-Japanese relations are
                            foundation stone of peace in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> seemed puzzled by evident
                            lack of discussion of third country issues during week-long talks in
                            Peking. I replied that there was a great deal to discuss of a
                            philosophic nature, particularly after <pb n="406" facs="0437"
                                xml:id="pg_406"/>more than two decades of non-dialogue between
                            Peking and Washington. Furthermore both sides were reluctant to get into
                            third country issues out of deference to our respective friends.
                            Moreover, as <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> had undoubtedly
                            noted from accounts of conversations Chou had had with visitors to
                            China, he delighted in wide-ranging talks of a philosophic-historic
                            nature and such discussions may have been helpful in removing certain
                            misunderstandings with regard to our position and confirming our genuine

                                >PRC</gloss> despite fundamental differences.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, like <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> earlier, felt there was an
                            apparent contradiction between our acceptance of the five principles and
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s subsequent
                            statement to the press that we would honor our defense commitment to
                            Taiwan. I repeated point I had made to <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> about sovereign rights of self defense and added
                            that our recognition of the five principles constituted no departure
                            from previous U.S. policy. Indeed, these principles offer a common
                            standard accepted by Peking which provides us with better basis to
                            criticize any acts of interference or aggression others might
                            commit.</p>
                        <p>5. In response to a further question re Taiwan, I called <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s attention to fact that we had
                            reaffirmed our interest in peaceful settlement by Chinese people
                            themselves and that key phrase in communiqué “with this prospect in
                            mind” referred to ultimate withdrawal of our forces. Full withdrawal is
                            therefore contingent on a solution satisfactory to Chinese people on
                            both sides of Taiwan Straits. This formulation was not a change in
                            policy but simply a definition in different terms. As promised at San
                            Clemente, we had not pulled the rug out from under our friends and
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> hoped I could persuade
                            leaders in Korea and Taiwan of this “correct” understanding since they
                            are relatively much more concerned. I commented that I was reasonably
                            confident about reactions of Koreans, even though latter are passing
                            through difficult period due to a number of factors. However, we had
                            made it clear publicly in Shanghai that we would observe all our
                            commitments (including that to <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>).
                            Furthermore we will continue to give assistance to Taiwan and we will
                            continue to promote trade and investment with and in Taiwan. Leaders on
                            Taiwan would do well to focus world attention on Taiwan’s own impressive
                            accomplishments in improving conditions of life for their people. It
                            could thus best ride out the storm. In this connection I urged that
                            Japan stay in close touch with us on this problem and that Japan too
                            should promote trade and investment in Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>7. At another point in our conversation when discussing outlook of <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> leadership, I stressed that <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> leaders seemed to prefer direct,
                            forthright presentation of views and to react negatively to any attempts
                                <pb n="407" facs="0438" xml:id="pg_407"/>to gloss over or paper-over
                            differences where indeed such differences exist. I therefore felt that
                            Japan would be well-advised to deal firmly with Peking as indeed
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> has been doing.
                            Excessive conciliatory efforts would only make Peking more demanding and
                            impair prospects for improved relations. The Peking leadership
                            recognizes that time will be required to adjust fundamental differences
                            with countries like U.S. and Japan. They are realistic in that
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>8. As to <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> allegations about reviving
                            Japanese militarism, we had rejected that viewpoint stating that
                            Japanese people and government are strongly opposed to any return to
                            militarism, that we understood their position and reasons for feeling
                            that way and fully supported it.</p>
                        <p>9. On trade, I felt that <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> had limited
                            interest in trading with us. Some Americans would be permitted to attend
                            Canton trade fair. But all Chinese statements on increasing trade
                            included the modification “gradually” or “step-by-step”.</p>
                        <p>10. In concluding I sought and received <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>’s agreement that substance of our talks would be
                            held in the strictest confidence. I could assert, as we had promised,
                            that no deals had been made under the table and that we were not
                            colluding with the Chinese against the Russians since that would
                            contradict the spirit of the President’s determination to promote
                            dialogue and improve relations among all powers.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>As my mission to Tokyo draws to a close, please accept my appreciation
                            for the privilege of having served you and our country at this critical
                            juncture at this important capital.</p>
                        <p>Much nonsense is being written in the newspapers. One myth is that your
                            historic visit to Peking is wrecking our relations with Japan. Another
                            is that our Embassy in Tokyo is “demoralized”.</p>
                        <p>As you so perceptively pointed out in your Third Annual Foreign Policy
                            Report to the Congress,<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">“Third Annual Report
                                to the Congress on United States Foreign Policy,” <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Public Papers: Nixon, 1972,</hi> pp. 194–345.</note> the July
                            15 announcement could not but have had repercussions in Japan. It is my
                            conviction that: a) thoughtful Japanese, including Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> and his government,
                            fully appreciate that your Peking visit was a historic breakthrough in
                            the quest for a generation of peace; b) because of Japanese
                            sensitivities and complexes about China, a certain amount of agitation
                            on Japan’s domestic political scene was inevitable; and c) thanks to
                            Anchorage, San Clemente and many other reminders, our pragmatic Japanese
                            friends will continue to attach primary importance to their relationship
                            with the United States, even as both our countries, consulting closely,
                            address the delicate challenge of improving relations with Peking.</p>
                        <p>Most Japanese realize that a healthy relationship with the United States
                            is indispensable for their country. Consistent with Newton’s laws of
                            gravitation, Japan needs a counterweight to the massive and proximate
                            power of China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Also,
                            despite the mirages of potential trade elsewhere, notably with Europe
                            and mainland China, there is for the Japanese no substitute for the
                            enormous American market for their exports.</p>
                        <p>As to our diplomatic endeavors, this is a world far different from that
                            of Ambassador Grew 35 years ago. Instead of a ship or two per month at
                            Yokohama, nearly 1,000 Americans de-plane daily at Haneda Airport. Aside
                            from the upsurge of tourism, it is only natural that <pb n="409"
                                facs="0440" xml:id="pg_409"/>the arrivals include innumerable
                            businessmen, seeking either to do business in Japan or to know how Japan
                            wrought its miracle.</p>
                        <p>It is also natural that in this shrinking planet, problems are much more
                            multilateral these days. Thus missions by Secretaries <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1"
                                >Connally</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName>
                            and other high-level Washington emissaries are invaluable. Some newsmen
                            speak as though such missions were unorthodox and unthinkable, but such
                            ventures have existed since the days when Silas Deane travelled to Paris
                            soliciting cooperation in our nation’s movement for independence.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that this Embassy has welcomed your special emissaries.
                            They have been able to achieve results well beyond bilateral
                            considerations. Our Tokyo mission has enjoyed cooperating with them,
                            backstopping their endeavors, and sending in to Washington a continuous
                            flow of pertinent information. Meanwhile, the Embassy has been keeping
                            busier than ever with the broadening spectrum of bilateral problems,
                            which inevitably has developed between the Free World’s two strongest
                            economic powers.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is not to say that our diplomatic intercourse with Japan
                            has been uncomplicated. Our associates in Washington have had
                            diversities of opinions, even as we have had some normal variations in
                            view here. Those with a keen sense of political trends in Japan have
                            been concerned that Japan’s postwar orientation, so favorable to us,
                            might be in jeopardy. Those who so understandably have been preoccupied
                            with sustaining a healthy United States economy, without which Japan’s
                            economic exhilarations cannot last, have favored tough stances.</p>
                        <p>My own tendency has been to steer the course between Scylla and
                            Charybdis. Tough we should and must be. Also essential is the
                            maintenance of a political regime in Japan cooperating fruitfully with
                            America.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing my stewardship, I believe we have weathered inescapably
                            adverse historic forces with success. The credit is yours. You
                            understood the importance of negotiating a mutually satisfactory
                            resolution of the Okinawa problem. Its achievement assured the
                            continuation of an American oriented policy in Japan, particularly the
                            automatic extension in 1970 of our Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
                            Security (the issue which prompted a volcanic eruption at the conclusion
                            of President Eisenhower’s administration).</p>
                        <p>While most of our economic problems have had global overtones, we can
                            report that much progress has been made in prying Japan loose from its
                            self-centered policies. The sizeable yen revaluation would not have been
                            predictable a year ago; it would not have occurred without August 15.
                            Meanwhile, much patient but cumulatively notable progress has been made
                            in scaling down restrictionism in Japan’s trade and investment
                            practices.</p>
                        <p><pb n="410" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_410"/>Despite adjustments achieved,
                            Japan remains our most formidable economic competitor. As one observer
                            phrases it, “The Japanese are guilty of unfair labor practices; they
                            like to work”. Thus your endeavors to increase American productivity and
                            forestall work-stoppages are of critical importance, if we hope to
                            remain competitive.</p>
                        <p>There seems little doubt but that for years to come, we shall have
                            serious problems with Japan in the economic field (as was true in
                            Ambassador Grew’s days but now with higher quality Japanese products).
                            Therefore, I am pleased that a fellow Illinoisan, whose credentials
                            include guiding a major American corporation’s interests adroitly and
                            successfully through Japan’s economic labyrinth, will be carrying on the
                            Ambassadorial responsibilities in Tokyo.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3"

                        <p>No capital is more important, no Ambassadorial work load more demanding.
                            Having since my arrival invested circa 18 hours per day, I have often
                            thought what is needed here is a four-platoon system: 1) one Ambassador
                            to work the day shift, i.e. a flood of vital paper work plus a full
                            schedule of appointments, including discussions with Japanese
                            officialdom and opinion leaders; 2) one to work the “night shift”, where
                            unlimited social occasions afford abundant opportunities for informal
                            consultations and problem solving; 3) one to take care of the
                            never-ending procession of top-level American visitors, e.g. government
                            officials, leading publishers, company presidents and vice presidents;
                            etc.; and 4) an Ambassador who can escape from the exhausting daily
                            grind to meditate where we are and where we are going.</p>
                        <p>If a generation of peace is to be achieved, no collaboration is more
                            important than that between our country and Japan. During the past three
                            years some painful adjustments to reality were required. Here in Japan,
                            if anywhere, 1971 was a “watershed year.” I am confident, however, that
                            the linchpin relationship is stronger for it.</p>
                        <p>In the future we must expect and accept a greater degree of Japanese
                            independence of action. At the same time, our Japanese friends now
                            realize that with strength comes responsibility. I believe we can count
                            on them to work closely with us in architecting the new structure of
                            world peace.</p>
                        <p>In your historic mission, you know you have not only the well wishes of
                            our Embassy in Tokyo, but those of all mankind.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> began by outlining
                            in some detail the role which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName> should play as the President’s personal
                            representative in Japan. Although Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> had previously been unknown
                            to either the President or to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> he, the Ambassador, came highly recommended by
                            people such as <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wanted Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> to know that the
                            President had full trust and confidence in him. He should consider
                            himself free to report back to the President directly whenever
                            instructions from elsewhere in the bureaucracy seem to be in conflict
                            with what he understood the President’s policy toward Japan to be.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> urged Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to try to the
                            maximum extent possible to have him, Ambassador <persName

                                House and declared his appreciation of the “telephone message from

                                explained, “I personally not concerned about you having private
                                meetings with Foreign Minister and other ministers but believe it
                                would not be desirable for status of Embassy here to exclude me from

                            by the Japanese, as had been the case with <persName corresp="#p_MAH_1"
                                >Armin Meyer</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> assured Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> that he would not be
                            by-passed. Every effort would be made to provide Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> with the maximum visibility
                            possible during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            visit to Japan. He would probably have private meetings with at least
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was on the way out anyway;
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> had been trying for at
                            least three months to have a private meeting in his house with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. Assuredly
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> would be
                            present at dinners or luncheons involving the Japanese leaders.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said
                            that he would do his damndest to get Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> in with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>, whose only interest was to
                            succeed to the Prime Ministership. If this didn’t work, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted, he would make a
                            strong statement emphasizing that the President had full trust and
                            confidence in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName>. It would certainly be possible to get the
                            Ambassador in with <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> and
                            high Foreign Ministry officials, and at the dinner at which <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>, and others would be present. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s interest in building
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> up was not
                            indirect—the reason that we had gone to such lengths to put Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> in Japan was to
                            get our man there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> gave his assessment
                            of U.S. relations with the Japanese, saying that the problems were due
                            to the fact that they were essentially a tribal society with a peculiar
                            lack of understanding of the opinions of anyone else. The survival and
                            glory of the Japanese leaders had been through their ability to maintain
                            this tribal identity. Although these people did not understand social
                            complexities elsewhere, they had a remarkable ability to mobilize
                            opinion in Japan. This was done through a process of social consensus.
                            It took a long time for them to make a decision, but once it was made it
                            was carried through very effectively.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> observed that the
                            Japanese were now moving in the direction of greater assertiveness in
                            foreign policy. This he considered a desirable thing, unlike some people
                            in State who still clung to the idea that the Japanese could be induced
                            to shoulder a greater share of the U.S. economic burden without
                            involving themselves politically. The “<persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> shock” had encouraged this trend, and in this
                            respect had had a good effect. Anyway, it couldn’t be undone. We had
                            tried in innumerable ways to brief them, but they seemed to want to use
                            the “<persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> shock” as an excuse
                            to get a more autonomous position. We were not, however, opposed to a
                            more autonomous Japanese position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stressed that he
                            didn’t know what precise conclusions should be drawn from this
                            situation. It was essential for us to maintain our alliance with Japan.
                            He did not believe, though, that we should <pb n="413" facs="0444"
                                xml:id="pg_413"/>keep going around apologizing to the Japanese over
                            the alleged slight that we had given them regarding the China
                            initiative. Rather, we should play up the position that they were our
                            key ally and that we would certainly not sell out our relationship with
                            Japan for the sake of opening up China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> remarked again that the Japanese would
                            inevitably assume a more autonomous position, and that they would play a
                            bigger role in political affairs. Paradoxically, the closer were our
                            ties with Japan, the better our relations with Peking would be.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> for his views on
                            the remilitarization of Japan, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that he personally felt that some
                            remilitarization of Japan would be useful because it would keep the
                            Chinese worried, especially with respect to Japan going nuclear. This,
                            of course, was not the State view. Regarding cables, our line was not as
                            soft as the State line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> described Tokyo as
                            one of the two or three posts in the world where it was worth being
                            ambassador, and where it made a difference who was the ambassador. He
                            suggested to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName> that the latter should not be too apologetic
                            in dealing with the Japanese, nor butter them up too much or be
                            obsequious. They themselves had made a profession out of being
                            obsequious to us in the 50’s and 60’s because they needed us to build
                            them up, but they didn’t need us now.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> asked how
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> felt about a
                            possible effort on our part to make Japan a permanent member of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> declared that this was
                            inevitable in his opinion. Both Japan and India ought to be permanent
                            members. However, as of the present moment he knew of no particular
                            effort on our part in this direction.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> raised the
                            question of economic policy with respect to Japan—could there be
                            conflicting guidelines between State and Treasury? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> assured Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> that this problem, if it
                            developed, could be handled. He personally was of the opinion that
                            economic consideration should be subordinate to political
                            considerations.</p>

                        <p>The rapprochement in our relations with Peking is a psychological
                            nightmare for Moscow, but one of its more concrete manifestations would
                            be if both Peking and Washington managed to accommodate Tokyo into a new
                            triangular relationship that, in effect, excluded the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for what the Soviet leaders consider
                            their rightful place in Asian affairs. But Soviet counters are not that
                            wide-ranging. They can and will try to limit and disrupt
                            Chinese-American relations. But as a long-term contingency the Soviets
                            will have to do their best to conciliate Japan and draw the Japanese
                            into a Soviet rather than Chinese orbit. This process has already begun
                            on the Soviet side. It is proceeding on the economic plane primarily,
                            but the political aspect is moving to the forefront since <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s visit to Tokyo in
                            January.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Bait</p>
                        <p>In the wake of the split with Peking, Russia’s largest trading partner in
                            Asia is Japan. But the real lure to the Japanese must be seen as the
                            vast natural resources that could be developed in the Soviet Far East.
                            Thus, the Soviets are pressing joint projects such as development of the
                            Tyumen oil deposits at a cost of around $4 billion which would supply,
                            by a pipeline to Nakhodka, 25–40 million tons a year. In return the
                            Japanese would extend a major credit to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> to develop the oil deposits and build the pipeline. A
                            team of Japanese experts will go to Moscow early in May to explore the
                            project. The Japanese are also interested in exploiting the coal
                            deposits of the Soviet Far East, and have already agreed to develop a
                            new port facility.</p>
                        <p>It is this type of approach—trading the development of Soviet natural
                            resources for Japanese technology and credit that the Soviets hope will
                            have a great appeal in the Japanese economic and business <pb n="415"
                                facs="0446" xml:id="pg_415"/>communities, and, therefore, shade over
                            into the Liberal-Democratic Party policies. Soviet indebtedness to Japan
                            and Japanese dependence on imports from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> would thus become a link to Tokyo that would be strong
                            reinsurance against Japanese involvement with China. Moreover, in view
                            of the probable increasingly difficult economic relations between the US
                            and Japan, the Soviets would see their own involvement as loosening
                            American ties and, in effect, offering an alternative source to sustain
                            Japan’s obsession with economic growth.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Politics</p>
                        <p>The economic relationship should not be discounted. Over the long term it
                            could prove a strong wedge for the Soviets. But, basically, the Soviets
                            have to decide whether to make the concession in the political field
                            which would be required by any Japanese government. And this comes down
                            to a straightforward territorial issue.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets still retain what the Japanese consider their “northern
                            territories—Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai Islands. These
                            islands were supposedly handed over to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> at Yalta, though it is not clear that a permanent
                            annexation was contemplated. (We, the US, say military occupation only
                            was envisaged.) The Japanese waived their claim to Southern Sakhalin and
                            the Kurils in the San Francisco Peace Treaty, but maintain their claim
                            to the “Northern Territories.” The joint Soviet-Japanese declaration of
                            peace in 1956 did not settle the issue, though the Soviets offered to
                            return Shikotan and the Habomai Islands upon the conclusion of a formal
                            peace treaty. The Japanese, however, held out for the two larger islands
                            of Kunashiri and Etorofu. There the matter rested until last year.
                            (Indeed the Soviets hardened their position by claiming the matter was
                            entirely settled, partly because they feared the implication for their
                            Chinese border if they admitted any territorial revision.)</p>
                        <p>In the wake of the US-China rapprochement, however, and especially the
                            reversion of Okinawa, the Soviet position has become more and more of a
                            liability, and apparently had to be subordinated to the larger concern
                            of a counteroffensive against Peking. Thus, the Soviets hinted that the
                            question of the islands was not actually closed and, when <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> was in Tokyo last January, it
                            was agreed to begin negotiations on a peace treaty “within the year.”
                            Since the Soviets well know that the first issue will be the territorial
                            claims, there is an implication that the Soviets will make concessions
                            rather than deadlock the treaty negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Peace treaty negotiations will also allow the Soviets to raise larger
                            political issues bearing on Japan’s position in Asia. It is certainly no
                            accident that the Soviets have begun to talk about Asian collective
                            security, and to spell out a few general principles—non-aggression, <pb
                                n="416" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_416"/>peaceful co-existence, etc.
                            Presumably, any Soviet-Japanese peace treaty might be an important piece
                            in Soviet development of an Asian grouping linked to the <gloss

                        <p>It is a cliché to describe Soviet policy as aimed at encircling China.
                            Nevertheless, this is the current thrust of Soviet policy in South Asia,
                            and to some extent in Southeast Asia. For such a policy to make much
                            sense, however, Japan (and the United States) are the key. We would do
                            well to realize that the Soviets have much to offer to Japan, including
                            an implied guarantee of security against China. Despite the traditional
                            Japanese distrust and antipathy toward Russia and its fascination with
                            China, the role of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cannot be
                            discounted in Japanese calculations.</p>
                        <p>As for the Soviets, it is worth ending on a vignette. Western Sinologists
                            who have talked with their Soviet counterparts report that the common
                            complaint is that the Soviet students are enthusiastically taking up
                            Japanese studies, including the language. When the Sinologists recently
                            appealed to the Government for more money for research, etc., on China,
                            they were turned down in favor of increasing the emphasis on Japan.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>There are a number of US-Japan security related issues that you may be
                            confronted with in your discussions with representatives of the
                            Government of Japan and/or the American Embassy. I would like to convey
                            to you my views on these issues in the event that you have the
                            opportunity to discuss them.</p>
                        <p>Recently, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>
                            approached Lt. General Graham, Commander U.S. Forces, Japan (<gloss
                                target="#t_COMUSJ_1">COMUSJ</gloss>) with a proposal that would
                            transfer the chairmanship of the US-Japan Joint Committee on Military
                            Affairs from <gloss target="#t_COMUSJ_1">COMUSJ</gloss> to the American
                            Embassy. <gloss target="#t_COMUSJ_1">COMUSJ</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC_1">CINCPAC</gloss>, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            oppose this proposal, and I fully support their position. The
                            preponderence of the problems considered by the committee are military
                            in nature and range across the entire spectrum of military operations.
                            Decisions on Joint Committee matters are in accordance with our treaty
                            and SOFA obligations. They vitally affect US forces and must primarily
                            be developed and made by military commanders. The Embassy
                            politico-military advisor, who sits on the Joint Committee, is kept
                            fully informed of all actions and problems as they are raised and
                            staffed. The myriad of technical detail necessary for the resolution of
                            these problems is found in military channels and can most effectively be
                            brought to bear under military control. I strongly urge that present
                            arrangement which has proven extremely effective since 1952 be
                            continued.</p>
                        <p>There is some evidence that the Japanese are thinking of possible means
                            of defining more specifically, at least in their own minds, military
                            situations that would require “prior consultation”. The prior
                            consultation clause concerning implementation of Article VI of the 1960
                                <gloss target="#t_MST_1">MST</gloss> is a flexible arrangement and
                            has served the US and Japan well. Specific wording follows: “Major
                            changes in their equipment, and the uses of facilities and areas in
                            Japan as bases for military combat operations to be undertaken from
                            Japan other than those conducted under Article V of the said treaty,
                            shall be the subjects of prior consultation with the <pb n="418"
                                facs="0449" xml:id="pg_418"/>government of Japan.” However, during
                            recent days in the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> Diet, opposition
                            parties and news media have paid much attention to the prior
                            consultation clause alleging lack of consultation in recent US Air
                            deployments from Japan to SE Asia. Based on <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> understandings
                            of the consultation clause, prior consultation was not required for
                            these moves. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> was informed.
                            Nevertheless, for political reasons Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> acquiesced to opposition
                            pressures and stated that this subject would be addressed at the next
                            US-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting. Defense concern is
                            that past arrangements not be undercut. Revision of the prior
                            consultation clause could severely restrict flexibility of employment of
                            US forces and use of facilities and areas in Japan and in turn bring the
                            viability of the US-<gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MST_1">MST</gloss> into serious question. US forces
                            and bases in Japan must continue to be available for support of other US
                            treaty commitments in East Asia with a minimum of restrictions.</p>
                        <p>We are at the onset of the typhoon season in the Pacific. Our build-up of
                            B–52s in <gloss target="#t_WESTPAC_1">WESTPAC</gloss> has saturated B–52
                            facilities at Guam and U-tapao<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">U-tapao was a
                                U.S. air base in Thailand.</note> to the extent that neither
                            location can be used to accommodate aircraft threatened by typhoon
                            tracks. Kadena Air Base on Okinawa has long been used for Guam based
                            B–52s during typhoon periods. Because of the fact that the B–52 requires
                            200 feet wide runways and taxiways, there are a limited number of
                            airfields that can be utilized. These include Kadena and Yokota in
                            Japan, Hsin Chu and CCK on Taiwan. The recent threat by typhoon Lola and
                            a request for <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> understanding that it
                            might become necessary to evacuate some B–52s to Yokota, due to the
                            large build-up of B–52s on Guam and in Thailand, resulted in Embassy
                            Tokyo taking strong opposition due to political sensitivities within the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>. There was an indication that
                            even continued use of Kadena would create political problems because of
                            the Okinawa elections. Obviously, it is not in the U.S. interest to
                            allow this extreme political sensitivity to persist. Typhoon evacuations
                            are emergency situations. Safe-haven by one of our major allies should
                            not be denied, regardless of class of aircraft. These temporary
                            evacuations should not be considered as a parallel issue to combat
                            operations. As long as the current high number of B–52s are deployed in
                                <gloss target="#t_WESTPAC_1">WESTPAC</gloss>, our planners require
                            assurances that bases in Japan, in addition to those in Okinawa, may be
                            used. I would greatly appreciate your effort to affirm an understanding
                            that should the need arise, Japan bases including Yokota Air Base on the
                            mainland, may be used for B–52 safehaven.</p>
                        <p><pb n="419" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_419"/>In the interest of improving the
                            morale of our Navy personnel and to provide better utilization of our
                            forward deployed carriers in the Pacific, I have proposed homeporting to
                            Yokosuka an aircraft carrier and airwing. As you know our carriers have
                            been visiting Yokosuka regularly for a number of years. The essential
                            difference between these visits and the stationing of an aircraft
                            carrier there would be the introduction of approximately 800 families to
                            the Yokosuka and Yokohama area. We have sufficient on base housing to
                            accommodate approximately 500 of the families and believe that the
                            overflow can be absorbed by the community. We are currently exchanging
                            views with the Department of State on this issue. State has raised the
                            issue of whether formal “prior consultation” would be required and the
                            old issue of public/opposition speculation as to whether nuclear weapons
                            might be aboard. I do not believe that these possible issues should
                            discourage us from proposing to the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            our need for the homeporting concept. The move would be visible evidence
                            of our intent to regard seriously our security commitments to Japan and
                            would promote closer ties between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>The last remaining order of business directly related to the reversion of
                            Okinawa entails relocation of US Naval air units from Naha Air Base and
                            the transfer by June 1973 of the immediate defense mission for the
                            islands. Plans for the latter are progressing smoothly. Plans for
                            relocation of the P–3s have not been implemented as in December 1971,
                            the Government of Japan failed to appropriate the required construction
                            funds. The next move is up to the Japanese. Once appropriations action
                            is taken by the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> and construction
                            plans are implemented, both on Okinawa and mainland Japan, we are
                            prepared to uphold our end of the agreement which will relocate this
                            last remaining military operation from Naha airport. Embassy Tokyo
                            believes that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> will act on this
                            issue after the Diet adjourns in June but the matter may be delayed
                            until the anticipated new government is formed.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, consistent with our basic tenets of stated policy toward Japan,
                            which encourages moderate increases and qualitative improvement in
                            Japan’s defense efforts, you may find an opportunity to discuss ways
                            that Japan might play a more effective national security role. We have
                            long encouraged the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> to share a
                            greater portion of the Asian security costs. Their meager expenditures
                            called for in their 4th Defense Build-up Plan continue to amount to less
                            than one percent of Japan’s annual <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>.
                            Possible contributions include Japan’s need to replace obsolete military
                            equipment, incentives for retention of people in uniform, expanded air
                            and submarine defense capability, increased participation in joint
                            exercises, and providing economic and supporting assistance to other
                            needy Asian allies. I believe that Japan can and should <pb n="420"
                                facs="0451" xml:id="pg_420"/>make a greater contribution to Asian
                            security from which it reaps substantial benefits.</p>

                        <p>During your visit to Japan next week, it would be extremely useful if you
                            reconfirm to the Japanese that the United States Government has a
                            continuing interest in Japanese ratification of the Nuclear
                            Non-proliferation Treaty.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">On April 6,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ETL_1">Eliot</persName> had sent to
                                Kissinger Nixon’s talking points for the April 10 signing ceremony
                                of the Biological Weapons Convention. In a memorandum discussing the
                                talking points, <persName corresp="#p_ETL_1">Eliot</persName> noted:
                                “Our reference, in the talking points, to the Non-proliferation
                                Treaty reflects our judgement that it would be very useful for the
                                President once again to endorse the Treaty. Absence of any mention
                                of the Non-proliferation Treaty in the President’s latest Annual
                                Foreign Policy Report has given rise to the belief in Tokyo that the
                                Administration is becoming less committed to the non-proliferation
                                objective, particularly with respect to Japan.” (Ibid., <gloss

                                Guhin sent <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> a
                                memorandum, stating that he had included a general statement in the
                                President’s draft remarks addressing this concern of the Department
                                of State. (Ibid.) The text of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>’s remarks at the signing ceremony are printed
                                in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Nixon 1972</hi>, pp.
                                525–526.</note> We would then find an opportunity also to apprise
                            the Soviets that this approach had been made.</p>
                        <p>There have been recurring indications of uncertainty on the part of the
                            Japanese Government and general public with respect to how firmly the
                            U.S. Government is committed to the concept that Japan should not
                            acquire nuclear weapons. The senior Soviet official in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> also raised this matter in Vienna
                            with the senior U.S. member of the Agency staff. This subject did not
                            arise in the course of the Vice President’s recent discussions with
                            Japanese Government leaders in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Assurances of continued U.S. support for Japanese ratification of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> have already been given, both
                            to the Japanese and to the Soviets. I feel strongly, however, that it is
                            important to put these fears <pb n="421" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_421"/>to
                            rest once and for all at a high level. Japanese participation in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> would in our view be greatly
                            welcomed both in Moscow and in Peking, and could also have highly
                            beneficial effects on progress toward wider acceptance of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> by other “threshold” countries.</p>
                        <p>The suggested approach would be particularly timely, coming on the heels
                            of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, since agreement on strategic
                            weapons limitations will tend to undercut criticism in Japan and
                            elsewhere that the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> places far
                            greater obligations on the non-nuclear states than on the nuclear
                            states.</p>
                        <p>While an eventual Japanese decision concerning <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss> ratification will obviously depend on many factors, an
                            important element will be their leaders’ continuing confidence in the US
                            nuclear umbrella. It would therefore be helpful if in connection with
                            reconfirming the US desire to have Japan ratify the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>, you could assure the Japanese that
                            the US-Japan Security Treaty remains the key to regional stability in
                            Asia and continues to be an essential element in the relationship
                            between Japan and the US.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the suggested approach, the following background
                            information may be helpful. When the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss> came into force on May 5, 1970, 97 countries including
                            Japan had signed the treaty. Some 70 countries have now become parties
                            to the treaty, although the rate of accession has diminished
                            substantially during the past year. Anticipated ratifications by the
                            EURATOM countries during the coming year should, however, restore some
                            of the earlier momentum.</p>
                        <p>We hope that the Japanese will now promptly begin their talks with the
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>, since their safeguards
                            arrangements will have to be settled before they will be ready to
                            propose <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> ratification to the Diet.
                            The Japanese Government has consistently maintained that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss> safeguards should not disadvantage
                            Japan, especially with respect to its competitive position vis-à-vis the
                            West Europeans. The <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> is currently
                            in the final stages of working out a safeguard agreement with EURATOM on
                            the basis of guidelines which Japan helped to shape.</p>
                        <p>The US has begun preliminary discussions with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> on implementation of the US
                            voluntary offer to place its non-military nuclear facilities under
                            international safeguards. This fact should help reassure Japanese
                            industry that it will not be disadvantaged in some fashion by
                            safeguards.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I want you to know
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName> is my trusted
                            assistant and that you can rely on him to maintain the confidential
                            nature of our talk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I myself have long had
                            two trusted assistants. I told the Ambassador that I would have one of
                            them with us today—Mr. Itoh.</p>
                        <p>I know that you have visited both China and Japan, but between these two
                            countries I think Japan is the best. It’s a pity that your time here is
                            so limited—you should see more of our country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a pity, but
                            I am touched by the reception I have received here. I have established
                            deep personal bonds here now. Of course, I have always considered Japan
                            as America’s basic friend in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: A quarter of a century
                            ago you wouldn’t have seen anything like what you see today when you
                            look out the window.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I was here 20
                            years ago, and at that time there was still great destruction; so I know
                            what great achievements you have made, and the enormous courage and
                            discipline you have shown in doing all this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: This hotel was built
                            11 years ago, just in time to accommodate a meeting of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. This was the third time such a
                            meeting had been held in Japan. It was the year Japan assumed a new
                            status under Article VIII of the U.N. Charter.</p>
                        <p><pb n="423" facs="0454" xml:id="pg_423"/>For what we have become today we
                            are very grateful to the United States. I remember when I was Finance
                            Minister, I negotiated a loan from the U.S. of $20 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They tell me that
                            as a Minister you’re a very tough negotiator.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I may have been in two
                            or three tough negotiations in the past, but I still have a feeling of
                            gratitude toward the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our feeling is the
                            same, based on great respect for your achievements and your people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I first started my
                            political activities under Prime Minister Shigehara, who was one of the
                            disciples of the late Prime Minister Yoshida. Since then I have remained
                            a good student of the Yoshida school of political training. In the over
                            25 years of Japanese recovery, I know how much we are indebted to the
                            U.S. Government. Between our two countries the problems are not so much
                            on the general posture of our relations but on individual issues.
                            Because we were occupied for some years, we still have the philosophy
                            that we’re occupied and this might come up from time to time. But on
                            major issues, we can always agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We both start from
                            the assumption that we are together—that we have a basic friendship in
                            the Pacific, and whatever differences come up are family
                            differences.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: We share common
                            interests. Japan would like to see U.S. leadership, economic or
                            otherwise, become stronger. Any difficulties the U.S. may find herself
                            in are not in Japan’s interests. The Japanese people see this, and
                            though the Liberal Democratic Party is in some difficulties, it has been
                            supported by the people for 25 years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I read in the
                            newspapers that you are one of the leaders who may succeed Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. I don’t know if
                            this is accurate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: The newspapers are
                            usually 100 percent wrong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are there
                            differences of policy between the various contenders or is it mostly a
                            question of personalities?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Mostly personality. I
                            would say that there is a religious difference between <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are these the
                            leading candidates?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Yes. Among the four,
                            three have experiences as Foreign Minister, and both <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> and I have been Finance
                            Minister. All Prime Ministers in the past, Shigehara, Yoshida, Ikeda,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, have been loyal members
                            of the Liberal Democratic Party—that’s how they became Prime Minister.
                            Of course, I’ve always been a member of the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1"
                                >LDP</gloss>, and so has <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Ohira</persName>. By contrast, <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> did not belong to any party when he first sought
                            a seat in the Diet. He went into politics this <pb n="424" facs="0455"
                                xml:id="pg_424"/>way: <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>
                            was depurged, and came back into political life; <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName> came with him and only entered
                            the Party after he (<persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>) was
                            elected. In some respects, though, he is in the Mainstream of the
                            Party.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> is not from the Liberal
                            Democratic Party, but from the National People’s Party.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When did he
                            join?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: About ten years ago.
                            At that time, his party merged with the Democratic Party, which later
                            merged with the Liberal Party, which then became the Liberal Democratic
                            Party.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I see that a
                            former student of mine, <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName>,
                            is going to run, too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: He is not expecting to
                            be elected—that is not his purpose. He’s looking at two elections in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is he holding his
                            people on the first ballot so that he can move later?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Actually, he will not
                            announce his candidacy officially because he won’t be able to get ten
                            percent of the total vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He’s thinking of
                            the time after next?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Yes, I agree. He is
                            hopeful he will be a strong candidate later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that because
                            the man who gets elected next time can’t run again?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Like your President
                            cannot run for a third term we have the same sort of ban. We have two
                            six year terms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Has an incumbent
                            Prime Minister ever been defeated for election as the President of his
                            party?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So whoever gets
                            elected President wins the Prime Ministership?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Mr. Hatoyama was Prime
                            Minister but did not seek re-election. <persName corresp="#p_KN_1"
                                >Kishi</persName> served two terms, Ikeda three, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> four, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> was there too long so the Party
                            passed a new rule to prevent a Prime Minister from being in office so
                            long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have found in
                            Washington that one may think four years is a long time, but it is
                            amazing how quickly this period is over. I spent my first year learning
                            the job and getting to know the key people, but from the middle of the
                            second year we were already in the election again. But it is a little
                            different in Japan, because you know all the key people already, and
                            whoever gets elected knows what it’s all about.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Yes, that’s the
                            difference in our parliamentary system. All members of the Cabinet must
                            be members of the Diet, and while <pb n="425" facs="0456"
                                xml:id="pg_425"/>your President serves four years, our Prime
                            Minister averages two years. We have had 11 elections in 22 years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn’t know a
                            single member of our Cabinet when I was appointed, even though on the
                            President’s behalf I had to deal with them every day. They want me to be
                            Ambassador to Outer Mongolia without communications, because it’s my job
                            to say <hi rend="italic">no.</hi> The President does all the pleasant
                            things and I do all the unpleasant ones.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: We, for example, know
                            every last member of the Opposition party—the governors, the Diet
                            members, etc. So whenever someone, somewhere has an interview with me, I
                            know exactly what’s on his mind. I’m known in the press as a very rapid
                            processor of people seeking interviews. They say I use a computer, but I
                            don’t—I know peoples’ minds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the
                            biggest problem for Japan now?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: China, because it’s
                            very challenging to establish a consensus and unify the view within the
                            Party on relations with China. After all, we had two thousand years of
                            interchange between Japan and China, culturally we are heavily indebted
                            to China, China was our enemy in two wars, and World War II started in
                            China, so China to us is not so simple as Cuba is to you.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Cuban problem
                            is a little larger than that for us.</p>
                        <p>What precisely is the nature of the China problem for Japanese
                            policy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: What to do with
                            Taiwan. It is a very delicate matter to attain a national consensus on
                            what attitude we should take with respect to Taiwan, not only because
                            Taiwan was a part of Japan for three-quarters of a century, but because
                            there are other connections between Japan and Taiwan. This is an
                            extremely sensitive problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Precisely what do
                            you believe your attitude should be?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: We need to have full
                            agreement between Japan and the U.S. on the Taiwan issue. This is a
                            difficult issue for Japan and China alone to settle. The U.S. and China
                            between them can afford to solve the issue, and in a more rational
                            manner than we in Japan can afford, and that’s why at this meeting I am
                            looking forward to hearing your views on Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Does this mean
                            that you won’t take steps independently from us regarding Taiwan?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: With respect to the
                            Taiwan problem, it would be more logical and rational to have the U.S.
                            involved in the solution rather than to have Japan act independently. As
                            in the case of a man and his wife having a fight, sometimes a family
                            friend can come in and solve the problem.</p>
                        <p><pb n="426" facs="0457" xml:id="pg_426"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: Who are the man and the wife, and who is the
                            friend?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: For sure, the good
                            friend is the U.S. Historically speaking, the man and wife are Japan and
                            China, but for the last three-quarters of a century Japan and Taiwan are
                            the couple.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As I understand
                            it, your view is tantamount to saying that on the disposition of the
                            relationship with Taiwan, Japan and the U.S. should have a common
                            policy. Is this correct?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I think that this
                            would be the best thing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are prepared to
                            do that. Incidentally, I’m not fully acquainted with the rules here in
                            Japan—what are the rules of our conversation? Will you have a press
                            conference? How will our conversation be reported?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I will have to have a
                            press conference, but I will never reveal what we said about Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we agree about
                            what we’ll say at the end?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Yes, let me talk to
                            you about this. What I will say is that we had a very general
                            discussion; that I wanted to get Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s view on very broad international matters,
                            but instead he pressured me to buy more from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s very good.
                            You can also tell them that he said you should stop selling so much!</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Excellent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then they will
                            have to double the guard on my way to the airport.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I will tell the press
                            that since Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            pressured me to buy more from the U.S., I was driven here this morning
                            by a Dodge.</p>
                        <p>I won’t touch on Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That would be
                            good.</p>
                        <p>We want you to know, Mr. Minister, that whoever becomes Prime Minister,
                            we want to establish a very close and confidential relationship with him
                            from the White House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I appreciate that
                            comment, and plan to keep my mouth very tightly closed about it. When
                            the late Robert F. Kennedy visited Japan, we talked about Okinawa and
                            there was some leak; the press played this up and I was embarrassed.
                            Therefore, I will be very strict.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That wasn’t the
                            reason why I said it. I was not referring to this conversation. We will
                            have many important issues to settle with the next Prime Minister, and
                            so the President will want to set up a very close relationship with him.
                            I didn’t say what I did as a warning, but as an indication of what we
                            want to set up in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I am convinced that
                            there is no problem too difficult for the two of us to solve. To do so
                            is not only in the interests of <pb n="427" facs="0458" xml:id="pg_427"
                            />both of us, but in the interests of the world. It was with this spirit
                            of determination that I was able to solve the textile problem which was
                            nagging at us for two or three years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This was very much
                            appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: If I could solve the
                            textile problem, I can solve anything else. Occasionally there might be
                            tough words in the course of the negotiations, but we can solve
                            anything. With that spirit in mind, I’m not as concerned at your
                            leap-frogging over our head regarding China as so many people here seem
                            to be. I have not minded this because I knew it was difficult for Japan
                            to establish this channel with China and that in a way you are acting on
                            our behalf.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We didn’t
                            leap-frog all that much, because in many respects you have had more
                            trade and contact than we have—and you have them still. We had the drama
                            and you had the contacts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I just want to make
                            sure that when I speak of leap-frogging, you don’t misunderstand what
                            I’m saying.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: In my heart, I’m glad
                            that you did what you did and I said so at the time. No matter how much
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> wanted to go
                            to Peking, they wouldn’t open a window or a door; however, by the
                            President’s going to Peking, they would want to smooth their
                            relationship with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In some respects
                            this is true.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: In this regard, I
                            would welcome your returning to Peking and solving the Taiwan
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How would you like
                            to see the Taiwan problem solved?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: This is a very
                            delicate issue which must be kept strictly confidential. If it leaked
                            there would be a scandal.</p>
                        <p>First, it is absolutely necessary that the Soviets will not be able to
                            intervene in Taiwan the way that they have intervened in Bangladesh and
                            North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Second, it should be solved as a domestic Chinese issue. This might be
                            time-consuming, but it must be accepted.</p>
                        <p>Third, it is best solved by the Chinese people themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With or without
                            the use of force? The big question is whether it can be solved
                            peacefully or through the use of force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: A solution by force
                            cannot be effected and should not be effected. When you compare the
                            Sino-U.S. relationship with the Sino-Soviet relationship, you can see
                            that the U.S. is not an enemy of China, while the Soviets, who have a
                            very long border with China, are shelling China. For two to three
                            hundred years the Chinese and the <pb n="428" facs="0459"
                                xml:id="pg_428"/>Russians have had a history of border conflicts,
                            and the Chinese people are beginning to find out that those who are
                            trying to contain China are not the Americans but the Soviets, as
                            illustrated by Bangladesh and North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>What aggravated the Sino-U.S. relationship as it concerned Taiwan was
                            your crossing the 38th parallel in Korea, and then the presence of the
                            Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait. At that time, the Chinese felt that
                            what the U.S. was up to was containing them. However, since then Soviet
                            activities have been stepped up and have become so serious. Now the
                            Chinese feel that if the Seventh Fleet was withdrawn the Soviets would
                            immediately step in. So in the eyes of the Chinese, the Seventh Fleet is
                            not an enemy but can even be a friend. That’s why I believe that when
                            the wills of the Japanese, American, and Chinese peoples spontaneously
                            become unified, the Taiwan problem will be solved. It seems to me that
                            until such a time further clarification can be sought in the U.S.-China
                            relationship, and for us, we can leave the Taiwan question more or less
                            in your hands. I believe that this is what the Chinese have in mind, but
                            they would never tell us or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It seems to be
                            such an easy problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: In the interests of a
                            peaceful solution of this problem, it makes good sense to divide the
                            labor between friends. In exchange, we are willing and are prepared to
                            cooperate on your defense problems, and to maintain a strong
                            international position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That reminds me of
                            a story of a husband-and-wife relationship. Someone asked the wife who
                            decided the big questions and who decided the little ones, and she said
                            that the husband decided all the big questions. Asked what kinds of
                            questions she decided, she said such things as what house to live in and
                            where the children should go to school. She was then asked what does <hi
                                rend="italic">he</hi> decide? Oh, she said, questions such as war
                            and peace, and international relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: (Laughing) I can
                            understand that. In Japan, and in the Orient, we say that whatever
                            concerns there are outside the home are the husband’s job, and whatever
                            are inside the home, are the wife’s. Another thing we believe in is that
                            bilateral solutions are difficult, and that a multilateral approach is
                            better. That is why we are making an appeal to <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss> on some trade issues with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with the
                            Minister that in some of the basic foreign policy problems today we have
                            a major responsibility, and that Japan can help in economic and other
                            relationships.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Yes, we can do that.
                            Under the kind of Constitution you’ve so kindly left us, we can do
                            that—we can help out economically.</p>
                        <p>During the days when the Constitution was being drafted in Japan, I
                            insisted that Japan should have armed forces befitting our place in <pb
                                n="429" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_429"/>the world; the U.S. refused, so
                            that’s why we have Article IX. So, under the Constitution, we were very
                            happy to yield to the husband, the U.S., and have him deal with all of
                            the problems outside the house. With respect to economic problems,
                            though, we can help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: During the
                            Occupation we exported many professors, who put into execution many
                            theories they could never put into effect at home. I have studied the
                            Occupation, and I must say you handled us with great skill. I admire
                            your ability to use the Occupation for Japanese purposes. You gave us
                            the illusion that we were giving you orders when we were actually
                            carrying out your wishes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: You very generously
                            provided Japan with technology and capital resources. This was very much
                            appreciated, and we know we owe you a royalty for what you have done in
                            the past. But I advise you to collect in a neat manner, not like a loan
                            shark or on a balance figure, but in the spirit of friendship.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can’t construct
                            a relationship on the basis of gratitude, but rather on the basis of
                            interest. We know you are a great country, and it would be a big mistake
                            for us to come to you and say that you owe us something. We should come
                            and discuss as friends what we both want, and work it out. It can’t be
                            worked out on the basis of the Occupation relationship. What we really
                            should do is to look at the problem, and see what is the best for the
                            future and forget the debts. In fact, there aren’t many debts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: You have given an
                            admirable exposé. I respect very much what you have said—I am very
                            impressed. In that spirit we should face up to and solve whatever
                            problems there are between our two countries on a rational and positive
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can be sure
                            that is the spirit of our Administration. We have tremendous problems in
                            the world, in foreign policy and in economic matters, but neither of us,
                            Japan and the U.S., can conduct an independent policy without doing
                            damage to both.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: What we need is
                            cooperation and good, constant consultations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me ask the
                            Minister something about economics, which is not a field I usually
                            address in great detail. I have been impressed by the fact that issues
                            arise only when there is already some crisis, and then businessmen come
                            to the White House and complain about the Japanese. The next thing is
                            that we have a confrontation, in which you think that your industry is
                            being penalized for efficiency, and we think that you are conducting
                            unfair practices. My major interest in economics is to make sure it
                            doesn’t disturb foreign policy, so I am not here to urge you to do
                            anything in particular. I wonder, though, whether the Minister has
                            thought about how to prevent these problems <pb n="430" facs="0461"
                                xml:id="pg_430"/>from developing—whether we can take steps ahead of
                            time to keep them from arising?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: This is indeed a very
                            important matter. Since we are both democratic nations, we can’t prevent
                            industries coming to governments with complaints—we have this too.
                            Perhaps there may be institutional differences between us or different
                            interpretations of facts, but these should be prevented from coming to
                            the surface. That’s why at San Clemente I proposed meetings of experts
                            from our two countries at the heads of division level and more
                            consultations between our two countries, even monthly ones. By such
                            methods we can prevent troubles from developing, both at the public and
                            private levels. We need mechanisms, both public and private, and on our
                            side we are trying to establish them.</p>
                        <p>I believe we need more dialogue between our experts. There are
                            institutional differences based on different customs and conventions.
                            You have anti-dumping restrictions, which are a matter of course for you
                            but to Japan look like court cases with somebody being tried. And if you
                            have something like this between two members of a family, you will never
                            have friendship between the two for three generations. With respect to
                            the textile issue, I felt that I was being sued. If beforehand I had
                            been given two months warning, and if there had been close
                            consultations, I believe that this situation could have been
                            avoided.</p>
                        <p>I expect to remain active in political life for ten more years, although
                            the Japanese retirement age is 55. I was surprised when Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AST_1">Agnew</persName> visited to hear from a
                            member of his staff, a former U.S. diplomat who had served in Tokyo and
                            had been an ambassador somewhere else, that he was retiring; I asked how
                            old he was, and was surprised to hear that he was 65. Maybe like him
                            I’ll stay until I am 65, which means 10 more years. Perhaps if I stay,
                            there won’t be any bad Japan-U.S. economic problems while I’m
                            around.</p>
                        <p>There are both good and not so good factors in Oriental philosophy. We
                            generally believe that when a difficult problem arises, like the problem
                            between a husband and wife, you should take time. Give it a night or
                            two, and it will be solved. But this does not work in economic matters,
                            for if you take time, the problem will be aggravated. It is better to
                            settle it quickly, to reach an agreement acceptable to both in the
                            interests of a mutual solution. The same thing can be said about
                            diplomacy. In problems affecting the East-West relationship, time is of
                            use, but problems between friends should be settled quickly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with your
                            general approach, but as the Minister knows Americans are very impatient
                            people and want to settle things quickly. However, our bureaucracy is
                            such that even if we wanted to get a quick solution, we couldn’t.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday some Japanese friends suggested to me that in economic fields
                            some machinery should be set up so that if a certain point is <pb
                                n="431" facs="0462" xml:id="pg_431"/>reached in an issue, some
                            automatic restraints can be put into effect. Do you think that this is a
                            useful approach?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: In Japan, we of course
                            believe that our basic legal instruments should handle trade and
                            economic problems, but our bureaucracy is ineffective and not always
                            able to handle such matters. Therefore, I would like to see the
                            executive branch handle them because it would bring more flexibility on
                            matters such as curbing exports, restraints on imports, managing foreign
                            exchange reserves, etc. Already some bills have been introduced in the
                            Diet to this effect.</p>
                        <p>Can I ask a couple of questions regarding the Soviet Union?</p>
                        <p>I think that you know the Soviets have made an offer to us on the
                            development of the Tyumen oil fields. Some time toward the end of this
                            month, a large Japanese private mission will go to the Soviet Union to
                            explore the Soviet proposal. What the Soviets will ultimately want is a
                            loan from international banks of $1 billion, in return for which they
                            will supply 25,000 to 40,000 kiloliters of oil in the period 1977–1987.
                            Japan must of course consider this with great care and caution because
                            the Chinese don’t approve of what is going on. Once the Soviets have
                            developed these Siberian lands, they can station tanks and aircraft
                            along the border with China, and can also make Nahodhka a great naval
                            base. But Japan wants crude oil, and wants to consummate the deal. So as
                            I mentioned at San Clemente, I believe that U.S. cooperation is called
                            for. Esso and Gulf have expressed a desire to subcontract some of the
                            work. What is your view?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There are three
                            problems in this: first, the immediate economic one; second, a long-term
                            economic problem; and third, a political problem. Most businessmen only
                            look at the immediate economic problem, but it’s easy to make
                            investments and hard to get the money back. Accordingly, in terms of the
                            immediate economic problem, we think it is a worth while project.
                            However, with respect to the long-term economic problem, we have already
                            seen in the Middle East what weak countries can do once they have
                            foreign investments on their territory. In these terms, what a big
                            country can do, when it has several billions of dollars of investment,
                            is really a serious matter to decide.</p>
                        <p>Of course, there is the political problem, which the Minister has already
                            explained and to which I can add nothing in terms of China or other
                            matters. We’re studying right now how to prevent the Soviet Union from
                            blackmailing us if we put large amounts of capital in there.</p>
                        <p>I have noticed that your businessmen are afraid we may want to maneuver
                            you out of the oil fields and get exclusive possibilities there. That
                            just proves your businessmen are as short sighted as ours. I can tell
                            you that we don’t want exclusive investment possibilities in Siberia,
                            and wouldn’t take them if we could get them. If you want exclusive <pb
                                n="432" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_432"/>possibilities, though, you’re
                            welcome. If you want all those headaches alone, you won’t get any
                            quarrel from us. And if you want to deal with the Soviets and China
                            yourself, you’re welcome. Our approach is—we are now studying the
                            problem, and will have Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName> going to Moscow in July for general
                            discussions, and he will discuss this project among others. His
                            instructions from us are not to do it on an exclusive basis. My view is
                            that we should do it jointly, but if your people get ahead of us I will
                            congratulate you. I’m being very frank now, and don’t want you to say
                            this to the newspapers. We will do it together with you if you want, but
                            you should think very carefully how to do it because this is not a
                            joke.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I fully agree, and
                            share your view. That’s why I asked you this question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that after
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName> has been in Moscow
                            we should send somebody to Tokyo, or you should send someone to
                            Washington, whichever you think better.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I would like to see
                            that kind of consultation. When I mentioned Gulf and Esso, what I had in
                            mind was not an exclusive Japanese deal; in San Clemente, my interest
                            was in getting a reading of your reaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: At that time, I
                            hadn’t studied the problem very carefully. What did we say?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I was fully aware at
                            that time that you had more pressing issues on your mind than the Tyumen
                            oil field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That was true at
                            the time. If I can tell the Minister this, it was very refreshing to
                            meet him in San Clemente. He’s very direct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I really think I’m
                            good timber for managing things, although I am not a great politician
                            because I speak directly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’ll end up
                            running the world if you are as good a diplomat as you are a
                            politician.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I want to talk about
                            the Cuba problem with perfect candor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Cuba?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: We buy $200 to $300
                            million worth of sugar from Cuba every year, but have nothing to invest
                            there and our vessels come back with empty bottoms. The Cubans want to
                            buy trucks and loaders from us, but we don’t want to do such business
                            without American understanding. We don’t want to get a cold eye from the
                            Americans for engaging in this kind of business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not for anything
                            less than $1 billion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: (Laughing) Maybe we
                            Orientals are too naïve. Another question is the importation of uranium
                            ore.</p>
                        <p><pb n="433" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_433"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: On the question of Cuba, I’ll be candid. The
                            Cuban issue is partly diplomatic, and partly a U.S. domestic political
                            issue. Quite candidly, with the U.S. elections coming up, this is not a
                            good time to discuss it rationally. I tell you honestly that if you do
                            it before November, there will be a problem. Somebody would raise it,
                            and we would have to take a formal position which otherwise would be
                            unnecessary. After the elections, I think we can talk about it in a
                            constructive way. I’m speaking very frankly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Of course, in the
                            political world we are always subject to hearsay and rumors. I have
                            heard some report that the President won’t seek re-election. I’m sure
                            that this is groundless.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s about as
                            likely as your not running as a candidate for the Prime Ministership. In
                            1976 he won’t run for re-election, but that’s only because the
                            Constitution prohibits it. I can tell you a joke going around in the
                            U.S. Question: What will Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> do if he gets elected President for life? Answer:
                            He’ll immediately start running for a second term. If you repeat this,
                            Mr. Minister, I’ll be without a job.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: If only the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> rules were changed, I’m sure I could
                            run for three or four terms. However, I don’t care about that.</p>
                        <p>My next topic is uranium ore. Japan is interested in purchasing 5,000
                            tons worth $300 million. We are not ready yet to give a concrete
                            commitment, but negotiations are going on with private firms and Japan
                            is willing to go ahead. I’m interested in your passing this along to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>. Just like when
                            Japan buys gold—we buy it from the U.S. Government and leave it in a
                            bank vault in New York City—we’re willing to buy the uranium from you
                            and have you keep it in storage for us. We’ll look into it this
                            week.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is not
                            handled by <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Peterson</persName>, but by the
                            Atomic Energy Commission. How can I get word to you without having 1,000
                            copies made of my answer?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: All you need to do is
                            to get government-to-government negotiations started.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll send our
                            Ambassador privately to let you know our reaction, and then we will act
                            formally. We’ll give you our informal attitude first.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> and I have agreed to
                            maintain a very informal relationship. He’s a businessman, a Chicago
                            businessman, and like Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>, who went to Europe, I’ve known him for some
                            time and understand his language.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> has a direct relationship
                            with the White House, and if you want to get a message to the President
                            or to me, just say to him to send it directly to the White House and I
                            will see it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Thank you, I’ll do
                            that.</p>
                        <p><pb n="434" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_434"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Minister, you have been very frank, and I
                            have appreciated the opportunity of talking to you. I’ve tried to be
                            frank with you.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I pray that in the
                            future you will consider talking to me with candor, and I will do the
                            same with you.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I consider this
                            the beginning of a long relationship, except that Mr. Minister will be
                            in politics longer than I—I can’t be involved beyond 1976.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: My political future is
                            nebulous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we just agree
                            briefly on what you, Mr. Minister, will tell the press?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: First, I would like to
                            be able to tell the press that if the Tyumen oil field is to be
                            developed Japan and the U.S. would like to cooperate; however, whether
                            we will be involved in this project is yet to be determined.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, you can say
                            that we haven’t yet made a decision, but in principle would like to
                            discuss it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Secondly, I would like
                            to say that I found an expression of U.S. interest in our buying 5,000
                            tons of uranium ore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But I don’t know
                            anything about it, I just don’t know—.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: Could I say that I
                            raised this matter with Your Excellency, and that it will be raised with
                            others in the U.S. Government?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s very unusual
                            for me to say that there is a matter outside my expertise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I’m sorry to make you
                            look like a nonexpert on this one thing. But the press will be hard on
                            us to get some news, so we must feed them something. Can I say that
                            economic problems between our two countries can be solved—anything and
                            everything?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (Nods)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: I would like to be
                            able to say that we exchanged views on U.S.-China, U.S.-Taiwan,
                            U.S.-Soviet, and U.S.-South Korea relations, but I can’t reveal the
                            content of our discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good.
                            Excellent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>: As a fifth item, I
                            would like to say we agreed that Japan and the U.S. should forget debts
                            and loyalties going back to Occupation days, but should take a new stand
                            on problems of the world today and have close consultations and
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can also say
                            that our meeting was conducted in a very friendly atmosphere, but this
                            is up to you.</p>
                        <p>Rather than saying “debts” of the Occupation, say “atmosphere” of the
                            Occupation, and in a spirit of cooperation.</p>
                        <p><pb n="435" facs="0466" xml:id="pg_435"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName>: I will say “as true friends”—as true friends,
                            Japan and the U.S. should take a new world view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overview</p>
                        <p>I believe my June 9–12 visit to Japan successfully served its basic
                            purpose of furthering understanding between our two countries and
                            strengthening the U.S.-Japanese partnership.</p>
                        <p>I went to explain the new shape of the world that we perceived, the
                            overall foreign policy and specific courses that you are pursuing to
                            meet changed conditions, the roles of the U.S. and Japan in the world,
                            and our evolving bilateral relationship. I also went to listen to their
                            general and specific concerns about U.S. policy and their view of the
                            future, and to get a better feel for Japanese motivations, psychology
                            and outlook.</p>
                        <p>Within the confines of less than three working days, I talked with the
                            broadest possible cross-section of Japanese political, economic,
                            intellectual and media leadership. I spent four hours with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, three and a half
                            hours with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> and over two hours with the other main challenger
                            for the succession, Minister of International Trade <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>. I also saw other leaders of the
                            ruling Liberal Democratic Party, including heads of various factions and
                                for<pb n="436" facs="0467" xml:id="pg_436"/>mer Foreign Ministers
                            during two lengthy working meals. Private sessions were also held with
                            leaders of the two main opposition parties, the Socialists (the first
                            time in several years apparently that a top American had seen them) and
                            the Komeito party. Several hours were spent formally and informally with
                            the leaders of Japanese business, two and a half hours with top media
                            representatives, and two hours with a cross-section of university
                            professors. Finally, my live television press conference at the
                            conclusion of my visit and the extensive media coverage throughout,
                            which was generally straight and positive, served to get our major
                            themes across to the Japanese public at large.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I believe my visit gave our new Ambassador, <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Robert Ingersoll</persName>, and his top staff a
                            fuller appreciation for your foreign policy in general and policy toward
                            Japan in particular, and I believe the wide exposure to all leadership
                            elements in Japan should enhance the Ambassador’s prestige and
                            entree.</p>
                        <p>On your behalf I conveyed privately and publicly announced your
                            invitation to the Emperor to visit the United States at a mutually
                            convenient time. I also informed <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>
                            about my upcoming trip, thus making clear we were taking them into our
                            confidence and arming them for any Japanese domestic discussion of the
                            trip.</p>
                        <p>Following are brief highlights of the major issues that were discussed,
                            including U.S.-Japanese relations, Japan’s role in the world, China, the
                            Soviet Union, Indochina, Korea and economic issues. There is also a
                            brief rundown of each of my meetings.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, we cannot expect major lasting accomplishments from such a
                            short visit by itself. In addition, the almost universally positive play
                            in Japan to date will inevitably be subject to editorial carping in
                            coming days by certain elements. Nevertheless, based on my own
                            instincts, the comments we received from both Japanese and Americans,
                            and the basic media coverage, I believe this trip cleared away much
                            underbrush and put us in a position to make a fresh departure in our
                            relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S.-Japan Relations</p>
                        <p>The note which I struck in general was that the U.S. valued its relations
                            with Japan very highly indeed, and believed that the maintenance of the
                            U.S.-Japan alliance was vital to peace in the Pacific. We ourselves were
                            satisfied with the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty and felt that it
                            should be kept in its present form for the foreseeable future. If any
                            changes were proposed, they would have to come from the Japanese. Of
                            course, we recognized that Japan was an important, mature country and we
                            would be willing to consider any adjustments in the Security Treaty the
                            Japanese might wish to make.</p>
                        <p>This was against a backdrop in which the U.S. emphatically was not
                            withdrawing from Asia but was determined to stay on under <pb n="437"
                                facs="0468" xml:id="pg_437"/>conditions acceptable to the American
                            people. In answer to Japanese concern, I made a point of saying this
                            meant, too, that we would stay on in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>In the foregoing light I stressed that we had no intention of pushing
                            Japan away from the U.S. If Japan wanted to pursue a more
                            self-sufficient course, it had to do that on its own and not because we
                            forced it in this direction. It was not the policy of this
                            Administration that Japan should develop nuclear weapons, or develop its
                            conventional forces beyond the capability of defending Japan’s home
                            islands. We did not see Japan playing a regional military role, but
                            hoped that it would help stabilize the region by continuing to give
                            economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>I noted that we saw no inconsistency between the friendly relations
                            between Japan and the U.S. and the policies we have pursued with Moscow
                            and Peking. We wanted to consult closely with the Japanese leaders on
                            moves which would affect our common interests. We regretted the lack of
                            advance notice regarding the announcement of your Peking visit, but the
                            circumstances were unique and we foresaw no repetition.</p>
                        <p>There was no effort to rebut my position, and I believe my words sunk
                            in.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japan’s Role in the World</p>
                        <p>Some Japanese had rather peculiar notions of the implications of your
                            “five-power world.” They thought it meant that we were pushing Japan to
                            become a military power or that we put Japan in the same category as
                            Russia and China.</p>
                        <p>I made clear that this was nonsense. Your philosophy under the Nixon
                            Doctrine, I stressed repeatedly, was not to cast them adrift in a
                            multipolar world but just the opposite: to treat Japan as an important
                            and mature country with a significant role to play, so that our alliance
                            was suited to modern conditions. Japan’s role in the world was for the
                            Japanese to determine.</p>
                        <p>There were many categories of power: In the military sphere there are
                            really only two powers, and there was, and would be, no pressure on
                            Japan from us to take on a military role. In the economic sphere it was
                            a multipolar world, and here Japan’s role was crucial. The task of
                            statesmanship was to develop a reliable process of multilateral
                            problem-solving among the Free World economic powers.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese were interested in this. They seemed reassured that we still
                            saw our close tie with them as the foundation of our policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan</p>
                        <p>There were two aspects of the China problem which the Japanese constantly
                            harped upon:</p>

                        <p>In addition, there was Japanese apprehension that, now we had
                            “leap-frogged” Japan in making high-level contact with Peking, we would
                            move rapidly toward the normalization of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> relations and leave Japan in the lurch.</p>
                        <p>I assured the Japanese that no secret deals had been struck in Peking
                            over Taiwan. In the Joint Communiqué we had acknowledged only what the
                            Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait maintain regarding the status
                            of Taiwan and did not challenge, i.e. took note of, this position. We
                            wanted the Taiwan issue to be settled peacefully by the parties
                            concerned (and felt that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> would
                            not use force), but we would not pressure the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss> into opening a dialogue with the <gloss

                            relationships with Taiwan would continue.</p>
                        <p>On Japan’s acceptance of <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>’s three conditions, I said that it would be
                            extremely regrettable if the U.S. and Japan became engaged in a rivalry
                            over improving relations with Peking. I foresaw only a gradual
                            improvement in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relations,
                            while Japan already had extensive economic and even some political
                            contacts with Peking. Our respective moves should be taken in such a way
                            as to prevent the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> from driving a
                            wedge between us, which it wanted to do.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, the “leap frog” theme clearly indicates that it was not so
                            much the substance of your China initiative which bothered the Japanese
                            as the fact that we did what they badly wanted to do <hi rend="italic"
                                >first.</hi></p>
                        <p>Once again it is hard to judge the impact of my words, but the headlines
                            and news stories played up positively this aspect of my statements.
                            Still, it will be very difficult for the Japanese to stop fulminating
                            over China policy, given the extent to which it is involved in domestic
                            politics and the succession question.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Union</p>
                        <p>There was not a great deal of discussion on our Soviet policy or the
                            Moscow Summit. Our China policy clearly was of greater interest to the
                            Japanese. Much of the interest in our Soviet policy was on economic
                            matters, including prospective Japanese development of Si<pb n="439"
                                facs="0470" xml:id="pg_439"/>beria and our possible involvement.
                            They seemed concerned about Soviet naval strength in the Far

                        <p>With Moscow as with Peking, I made clear that we distinguish between our
                            friends and potential adversaries and that the Free World should not
                            engage in a race toward either capital.<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3"

                                sentence.</note> My general presentation was to describe the
                            agreements in Moscow as falling into three categories: First, those like
                            environment, science and space which reflected the fact that we were two
                            advanced industrial countries with common problems and opportunities.
                            Secondly, the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Agreement which was
                            an exclusive problem between the world’s two superpowers and which fully
                            safeguarded our strategic posture. Thirdly, the basic principles of
                            bilateral relations which constitute an aspiration and a framework for
                            our future relations, although we were not naive about its binding
                            quality. I also indicated that we expected further progress on trade
                            issues during the summer.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indochina</p>
                        <p>There were many questions about our Vietnam policy, particularly in my
                            meeting with Japanese academics. I explained your policy at length,
                            stressing that you were determined to see it through and that the only
                            issue left was the Communist demand that we overthrow our ally to
                            appease our enemy. I pointed out on many occasions—I think with
                            effect—that Japan has a direct interest in our constancy toward our
                            allies. It could only be unsettling to Japan if we did sell out an
                            ally’s interest. On the other hand, our steadfastness toward a small
                            ally on the periphery of Asia should be particularly reassuring to the
                            major ally on whom we founded our Asian policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Korea</p>
                        <p>Regarding Korea, I assured the Japanese that I knew of no present plans
                            to reduce U.S. forces in the Republic of Korea, that any future
                            reductions would not affect materially U.S. military capabilities there,
                            and that in any case we would consult closely with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> and Japan. As in other parts of Asia
                            we were staying on in South Korea as part of the Nixon Doctrine, and
                            would maintain our treaty relationship with the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss>. This position answered the main area of Japanese
                            concern—that the U.S. not pull out of Korea. I also referred in passing
                            to the important relationship between the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security
                            Treaty and the defense of South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese did not press me on the subject of improving U.S. and
                            Japanese relations with North Korea. They were unanimous that <pb
                                n="440" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_440"/>the defense of Japan made Korea
                            an area of special sensitivity to Tokyo—though without the emotional
                            overtures of China.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Issues</p>
                        <p>Although the main focus of my talks was on political matters, there was
                            considerable discussion of economic problems including what some
                            Japanese believed to be protectionist, and essentially anti-Japanese,
                            U.S. economic policies. The Japanese recognize the problems which their
                            large trade surpluses will cause, and noted that they were making
                            efforts to deal with the problem. I emphasized the importance of their
                            moving promptly to decrease the surpluses.</p>
                        <p>In response to their queries on what could be done to solve economic
                            problems between us, I stressed that Japan, along with U.S. and Europe,
                            is one of the three pillars of the free world economy. What was required
                            now was a cooperative effort among the three powerful economic centers
                            to reform the international monetary and trading systems, and to work
                            out a framework which would enable us to identify and deal with problems
                            before they become major political issues. Such an approach would allow
                            us to handle problems not on an ad hoc basis—which means that pressure
                            from special interest groups often forces governments to take positions
                            not in the overall national interest—but in a broader context which
                            allows us rationally, and cooperatively, to set broad guidelines and
                            policy consistent with our national interests, which can constitute a
                            framework in dealing with individual problems.</p>
                        <p>Another issue raised at various times was whether the United States would
                            be willing to play a part in joint ventures between Japan and <gloss

                            no objection to the Soviet Union and Japan exploring joint ventures with
                            one another; if U.S. firms wanted to participate and required U.S.
                            Government financing, we would have to look at our participation on the
                            merits of the case, but in principle we would have no objection to our
                            companies discussing this.<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4"><persName

                            of your Vietnam policy, in his wariness that the Communist powers might

                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, emphasized that there were no secret
                            deals, and said that we expected our relations with Peking to develop
                            gradually.</p>
                        <p>—He indicated that he had been concerned not so much over the so-called
                            “shokku” shock, of our policy but rather the motivations behind it. He
                            suggested some envy that we were able to get around the Taiwan issue in
                            our dealings with Peking, which was impossible for Japan because its
                            domestic situation and trade interests gave Peking greater leverage.</p>
                        <p>—He approved of our line with the Chinese that the U.S.-Japan Mutual
                            Security Treaty should reassure Peking about Japan’s future military
                            role and he showed interest in the state of China’s nuclear program.</p>
                        <p>—He also said that <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>’s views were now quite moderate on U.S. policy,
                            that he recognized that we had to make our moves, and was showing more
                            flexibility toward the Taiwanese, including representation for them in
                            the cabinet.</p>
                        <p>—In response to his queries, I briefly described the powerful presence of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTZ_1">Mao</persName> and the intelligence of
                            Chou.</p>
                        <p>On <hi rend="italic">Vietnam:</hi></p>
                        <p>—I made clear your determination to see the conflict through, that our
                            policy was to isolate North Vietnam physically and psychologically, and
                            that we would not overthrow Thieu.</p>
                        <p>—He applauded your firm stance, said that the biggest mistake we could
                            make would be to overturn the government, and asked how Japan could help
                            us. I replied that they should have no contacts with Hanoi in the near
                            term and that they should give more economic assistance to South
                            Vietnam. He responded that they had planned to give some humanitarian
                            aid also to North Vietnam, but would now delay this until after the war
                            was over.</p>
                        <p>—As I pointed out in several other public and private sessions during my
                            visit, I emphasized the implications for our major ally Japan <pb
                                n="442" facs="0473" xml:id="pg_442"/>of our steadfastness with a
                            small friend, South Vietnam. I concluded that we thought we had the
                            Vietnam situation well in hand and that only a <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG_1">McGovern</persName> victory could bring
                            defeat.</p>
                        <p>In response to his questions about the <hi rend="italic">Moscow
                                Summit:</hi></p>
                        <p>—I gave him the rundown on the three types of agreements that I explained
                            to other groups as well as those bilateral agreements which reflected
                            the fact that the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had
                            common problems as advanced industrial countries; the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement involving the only two
                            countries who could destroy the world; and the basic principles which we
                            recognized were no instant panaceas but rather useful guideposts for
                            future relations. I emphasized that our strategic position in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Treaty firmly guaranteed our
                            national security.</p>
                        <p>—In response to his questions I said that the Sino-Soviet split was
                            obviously serious but that we would not try to exacerbate it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> asked about the <hi
                                rend="italic">Korea</hi> situation.</p>
                        <p>—I replied that there might be some adjustment in our forces over time
                            but that we would always consult Japan. I emphasized that we had made no
                            deal with either China or Russia, and said that we had the impression
                            that those two countries’ policies with regard to Korea were prompted
                            more by their own rivalry rather than any desire to really press North
                            Korean demands upon us.</p>
                        <p>Toward the end of our conversation I managed to ask my only question,
                            inviting his comments on the <hi rend="italic">succession
                            question.</hi></p>
                        <p>—He made clear his preference for <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> because of his age and experience, his
                            traditional education, his knowledge of international affairs and his
                            greater world reputation. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            he clearly thought was tough and intelligent, but unpolished and
                            somewhat of an unknown factor, particularly on international
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>—He stressed that he would do everything he could to help <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>, but that even with this
                            assistance he placed <persName corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>’s
                            chances at no better than 50–50, given the support that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> enjoyed in many quarters,
                            especially among the younger elements. Either man, however, he
                            emphasized, would pursue policies within the basic Liberal Democratic
                            Party framework.</p>
                        <p>I forewarned <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> about my <hi
                                rend="italic">upcoming trip to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                    >PRC</gloss>,</hi> saying that we would give him advance notice
                            when the date was firmly set. He indicated that the announcement of the
                            trip might affect the debate in the Diet over some remaining legislative
                            issues but that this would be manageable, particularly since he would be
                            able to say that this had been discussed with him in advance. He
                            specifically asked me to put in a good word with the Chinese on behalf
                            of Japan and its wish to improve relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended with <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>
                            again stressing the need for the Free World to stick together and
                            expressing his hope for your reelection. <pb n="443" facs="0474"
                                xml:id="pg_443"/>Although our conversation did not dwell as much on
                            future U.S.-Japanese relations as I would have liked, I believe it was
                            nevertheless very helpful in giving him a firsthand rundown on your
                            perspective and policies. He clearly came away reassured about the basic
                            U.S. course and demonstrated that, whatever the recent turbulence in our
                            bilateral relations, he and Japan remain our good friends.</p>

                                >Fukuda</persName> appeared more relaxed than he seemed last January

                                    >Fukuda</persName> was part of the official Japanese party that

                            succession problem was much on his mind. He went over in some detail the
                            complexities of the Japanese political system in choosing a new party
                            president and prime minister, but he also gave the impression of being
                            confident as to his chances. The tenor of his remarks on the future of
                            U.S.-Japan relations did not suggest a man whose political career was
                            coming to an end.</p>
                        <p>As might be expected from a Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>’s remarks touched upon a broad range of political
                            issues and more peripherally on economic matters. I dealt with these
                            along the lines outlined above. There were in addition a number of
                            points of particular interest.</p>
                        <p>—He acknowledged that your China initiative had caused him problems,
                            since in his words Japan-<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relations
                            comprise the most important problem for the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>—He felt that the first two of <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>’s three conditions for normalizing <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>-Japanese relations had been pretty
                            well overtaken by events and would become acceptable once
                            government-to-government negotiations began. He meant to hold firm on
                            the third, however (abrogation of the Japan-<gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss> Peace Treaty) pending an actual agreement on
                            normalization of Japan’s relations with Peking. The impression he tried
                            to convey was that he would not be pushed around by the Chinese (though
                            he of course might not be able to resist pressures for acceptance).</p>
                        <p>—He was worried over the Vietnam war, but primarily because he felt that
                            the war and the arms race with the Soviet Union had eroded U.S. economic
                            strength and staying power. I suggested that Japan should hold off
                            contacts with Hanoi over the next several months and he agreed.</p>
                        <p>—He responded very affirmatively to my statement that the White House
                            wanted to have the closest possible relationship with the top <pb
                                n="444" facs="0475" xml:id="pg_444"/>Japanese leaders. He indicated
                            that the confidentiality of any arrangement to this end could be
                            assured. He was receptive to the idea of a meeting between you and the
                            new Japanese Prime Minister later this summer.</p>
                        <p>—He was concerned over the possibility of expanded Soviet efforts to
                            exercise influence in Asia. However, he hoped for U.S. participation in
                            Siberian development. I told him that Secretary <persName

                            this matter, and that there would be consultations with Japan on
                                it.<note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">On June 8, the day of <persName

                                encouraging joint U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation. He noted: “At

                                paranoiac and pathological, and not matter of substance. At another
                                level, it would seem to me that there is a <hi rend="italic"

                            conference whether I could make this invitation public, and indeed did
                            so.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> and I met for over two
                            hours at breakfast on June 12. Like <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                                >Fukuda</persName>, he appeared calm and confident about the outcome
                            of the succession contest. From some of the points he made, though, I
                            believe that there was some insecurity in his position and that he was
                            trying in subtle ways to gain U.S. sympathy if not necessarily support.
                            For example,</p>
                        <p>—He went to some lengths to explain that he had always been a member of
                            the Liberal-Democratic Party (and hence inferentially was <pb n="445"
                                facs="0476" xml:id="pg_445"/>identified with stalwart pro-U.S. Prime
                            Ministers) while some of the other contenders, notably <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT_1">Fukuda</persName>, arrived much later on the
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> scene.</p>
                        <p>—He said that he thought the way you had handled your China initiative
                            was correct, and in fact he said so at the time of your July 15
                            announcement. He added that we should not engage in a U.S.-Japanese race
                            to Peking.</p>
                        <p>—He expressed the belief that the U.S. should help to settle the Taiwan
                            issue between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> “as a
                            family friend.” In this way, the U.S. would participate in the
                            settlement and help to draw the others closer.</p>
                        <p>—He claimed credit—justifiably—for settling the textile issue between
                            Japan and the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Somewhat surprisingly, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> did
                            not take the opportunity to go much farther afield than Taiwan and the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> in discussing political issues.
                            Rather, he concentrated more on economic questions. In particular, he
                            went into considerable detail in discussing the possibility of joint
                            U.S.-Japan participation in the Tyumen oil field development scheme with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. (I responded to this as
                            outlined above.) I sense that he feels much more certain of himself in
                            economic matters than political ones.</p>
                        <p>I took the opportunity of informing him that regardless of who became
                            Prime Minister, the White House wanted to establish close and cordial
                            relations with this individual. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> seemed pleased.</p>
                        <p>As you know, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> at 55 is about
                            ten years younger than the other would-be successors to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>. He appears to be a very vigorous,
                            direct, and dynamic man, and I have no reason to believe that as Prime
                            Minister he would take Japan down an anti-U.S. course. Being identified
                            with economic matters, he undoubtedly has a clear concept as to where
                            Japan’s interests lie.</p>

                            minister. <persName corresp="#p_NY_1">Nakasone</persName> expresses a
                            vague kind of assertive nationalism: He hints vaguely at defects in the

                            program to spur prosperity in Asia. He also had an imaginative
                            suggestion of an automatic adjustment process <pb n="446" facs="0477"

                            have dinner with four former Foreign Ministers—Fujiyama, <persName

                            >Ohira</persName>—of whom the last two are also contenders for the Prime
                            Ministership. Neither <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> nor
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> spoke a substantive
                            word the whole evening. I suspect that their being with me together made
                            it difficult for each to say anything which might tip their hands. Each
                            controls substantial blocs of votes in the <gloss target="#t_LDP_1"
                                >LDP</gloss>, and might be able to swing the election one way or

                            themselves. One or the other could again be Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>Fujiyama’s and <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName>’s remarks
                            were rather puerile. Fujiyama wanted a more “positive” U.S. attitude
                            toward ending the Vietnam war, which meant in effect accepting Hanoi’s
                            terms, while <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Aichi</persName> was worried
                            about a possible “anti-establishment” attitude among aid recipients in
                            the underdeveloped world requiring the developed countries to be more
                            generous. I took issue with both of them, and I believe with some
                            effect.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Japanese Socialist Party.</hi> My meetings with the
                            Japanese Socialist Party (<gloss target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss>)—the
                            first with Party leaders by a senior American official since Robert
                            Kennedy—dealt primarily with Vietnam, U.S. bases in Japan and Japan’s
                            relations with China. The <gloss target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss> leaders
                            expressed the view that U.S. “aggression” in Vietnam should cease as
                            soon as possible, and that they could not tolerate further use of
                            Japanese bases for support of the war. The Party did, however, welcome
                            your visit to Peking—although other parties in Japan were
                            “shocked”—because it felt that your visit would contribute to a
                            reduction of tension with China and be an element in ending the war in
                            Vietnam. It was disappointed that it had seen no evidence of the
                            latter.</p>
                        <p>In responding to this, I explained in some detail your Vietnam policy and
                            the reasons why we cannot settle war on the basis of the other side’s
                            proposed “Government of National Concord.” I further explained—in
                            response to the <gloss target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss> leaders’ fear that
                            the U.S. was <pb n="447" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_447"/>restraining
                            Japan’s efforts too closely to China—that we had no judgment on what
                            policy Japan should adopt vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>, no intention of complicating Japan’s efforts in this
                            regard, and no intention of substituting Japan’s forces for our forces
                            in Asia. With regard to the Japanese-U.S. security treaty, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JSP_1">JSP</gloss> leaders were ambivalent, but what came
                            through clearly was their view that if Japan felt it could not continue
                            to rely on the U.S. for its defense, this would increase Japanese
                            pressure to rearm.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Komeito.</hi> My meeting with officials of Komeito
                            (Japan’s third largest party) gave me the opportunity to pursue with the
                            Party Secretary, who had just returned from North Korea, his
                            observations on his trip. The Secretary, who had met with Prime Minister
                            Kim, was struck by the heavy-handed police state which existed in North
                            Korea—which exceeded his expectations—and by the self-centered character
                            of Kim. He also made the point that—contrary to what he had earlier
                            believed—if U.S. troops were removed from the South it was entirely
                            possible that the North would move into the South.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">JUSEC Meeting.</hi> Following my opening meeting with
                            Embassy officials on June 10, 1972, I met for approximately two and
                            one-half hours with my hosts, the Japan-U.S. Economic Council (JUSEC)
                            which is composed of the leading businessmen in Japan. This semi-public
                            session gave me a good opportunity to set the framework for my visit and
                            all my subsequent conversations.</p>
                        <p>I began the meeting with a forty minute presentation of the major themes
                            of your foreign policy and issues in U.S.-Japan relations along the
                            lines described above. On economic matters, I emphasized the importance
                            of our finding a framework to deal with economic issues in a rational
                            way, before they become major political problems.</p>
                        <p>In the question and answer session, the Japanese businessmen asked for
                            more details relating to our moves toward China, how we saw the Japanese
                            role in Asia evolving, and whether we envisaged a change in the
                            U.S.-Japanese Security Treaty. I explained further our reasons for
                            improving relations with China, stressed the priority of our partnership
                            with Japan and stated that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was in the
                            common interest of both countries and that we saw no need to change
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The meeting gave me a better idea of Japanese concerns, and I dealt with
                            the questions frankly and in as specific terms as possible. My overall
                            impression was that Japanese businessmen were concerned about how the
                            United States saw Japan in the years ahead, where Japan itself was
                            going, and what role we envisaged for Japan in the economic and military
                            spheres. I believe my answers reassured them that we were not casting
                            them adrift, that we regard their friendship as of the utmost importance
                            to us, and that we want to pursue a policy of <pb n="448" facs="0479"

                            meeting of approximately two hours with a statement similar to that with
                            which I led off the JUSEC meeting. I also covered in some detail your
                            Indochina policy, in response to criticism of our Vietnam policy which I
                            had read in the Japanese press. The question and answer session
                            proceeded in a manner similar to that of the JUSEC meeting. The editors
                            wanted to hear our views on the concept of a collective Asian security
                            arrangement, as proposed by Brezhnev, and I explained that if this were
                            directed against the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> we could not
                            participate. I added that it would be shortsighted and foolish to
                            attempt to play the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> off against
                            Moscow and vice versa.</p>

                            taken up with answering questions from two who had signed a public

                            The others in the group were more eager to discuss other topics and were
                            far less hostile. They asked the standard questions, particularly our
                            policy toward Taiwan and Korea, as well as about the future of
                            U.S.-Japanese relations. Like academics everywhere, they were sure they
                            had figured out the rational calculation and complicated purposes that

                            has been something of an unknown quantity.</p>
                        <p>—In a television interview July 5, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> reaffirmed the vital importance of the U.S.-Japan
                            alliance to Japan, saying it was “like water and air” to Japan, without
                            which Japan “cannot survive.”</p>

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Masayoshi Ohira</persName>, who
                            served earlier as Foreign Minister (1963–66) and who as the leader of
                            the Liberal Democratic Party’s second largest faction swung his weight
                            behind <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s election in
                            mid-June. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> also believes
                            Japan’s foreign policy must be premised on the U.S.-Japan alliance, and
                            in his previous stint as Foreign Minister was consistently reliable and
                            cooperative in his dealings with us. Equally important, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> did <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            choose as his Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Takeo
                                Miki</persName>, who is also a former Foreign Minister and who also,
                            as a major <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> faction leader threw his
                            support to <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> last month.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Miki</persName> is not so committed to
                            the U.S.-Japan alliance and is more inclined to independent Japanese
                            initiatives. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> has said he
                            would leave foreign policy largely to his Foreign Minister and the
                            Foreign Office. This should act as a constraint on <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s reputed impulsiveness,
                            especially until he has acquired more experience in foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>—On China policy, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> has
                            already committed himself publicly to early normalization of relations
                            with Peking, but has noted that <pb n="450" facs="0481" xml:id="pg_450"
                            />bilateral relations between states are not a one-way street. This may
                            reflect the toughening in Japan’s position clearly articulated to
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName> July 6
                            by Vice Foreign Minister Hogen, when he said that Japan’s bargaining
                            position with Peking was stronger than previously realized. (Hogen also
                            said that Japan would not sever its non-diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and
                            that it would not yield to any <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            pressures on the U.S.-Japan security relationship.) Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>’s views also support
                            this approach: he has said that Japan should normalize relations with
                            Peking on a pragmatic, balanced basis that takes account of its
                            relations with Taiwan.</p>

                                basically a moderate who is deeply rooted in Japan’s postwar
                                conservative political tradition. His departures are in his having
                                risen through early and striking success in business—and without the
                                benefit of a university education—rather than through the
                                traditional bureaucratic route, and in his image of youth, flair,
                                and decisiveness.</p>
                            <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s freedom of action is
                                limited by the Japanese political system, in which the prime
                                minister is only the first among equals, in which the cabinet—like
                                other groups in society—is collectively responsible for its policy
                                decisions, and in which the balance of influence in government among
                                the entrenched bureaucracy, big business, and political groups works
                                against non-consensus politics.</p></quote>

                            policy, at least in the near term, is likely to be more in style. He is
                            likely to be more assertive and self-confident, and as regards relations
                            with us, particularly in the economic field. Given his most recent post
                            as Minister of International Trade and Industry (<gloss
                                target="#t_MITI_1">MITI</gloss>) and his business background, it is
                            in Japan’s economic relations with us that he is likely to assert
                            himself first. Together with his nationalistic <gloss target="#t_MITI_1"

                            can be counted on to resist efforts to pressure Japan to make reforms
                            that may assist particular U.S. trade interests but are contrary to
                            Japan’s interests. At the same time, he has strongly committed himself

                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: I gather it is
                            primarily on political issues.</p>
                        <p>K: There should be no Communiqué without White House approval. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> should not be negotiating
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH_1">Holdridge</persName>: I have told them
                            that nothing should go out without White House approval.</p>
                        <p>K: In no negotiation in which I am involved do I tolerate study groups.
                            No one has ever leaked on me because they do not know what I am doing. I
                            ask a lot of questions but no one knows which I will use.</p>
                        <p>I want John to go over there to get concrete agreement or at least so
                            that we will know what we will face when we meet <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>. I don’t want to be faced with a
                            State Communiqué. I don’t want to go over there and get hit so that we
                            will have to pay a high price for what we want to get.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: It is essential to
                            get rid of the trade deficit with Japan. The President will not want to
                            negotiate figures. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> should
                            be able to say that he agrees that we should get rid of the deficit or,
                            if <pb n="452" facs="0483" xml:id="pg_452"/>agreement has already been
                            reached, we should announce specifics in such areas as agriculture,
                            uranium, airplanes and opening up of Japan to investment. A general
                            commitment from the Prime Minister would be useful for the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>K: <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> will work with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName> to see what can be done, but
                            can these discussions be kept quiet until Hawaii? Then, if we can keep
                            this quiet, we can say in the Communiqué that the President has been
                            informed by the Prime Minister that Japan will do . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: We can keep this quiet
                            over here. The question is can Japan. There are four ministries involved
                            over there. However, this might be to our benefit since some may leak,
                            but only a part of the package.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: We can get a pretty good
                            package. It could be three quarters of a billion dollars.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: $600 to $900 million.
                            With regard to wholesale and retail packaging, letters are being
                            prepared.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: Can these be held
                            up?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: Yes, they can be held
                            until Hawaii. There is also the issue of uranium. The Japanese team has
                            delayed coming here. The <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> wants to
                            go quickly. The issue can be moved quickly.</p>
                        <p>K: Good. Do that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: The Foreign Office and
                            Finance Ministry feel that we can put together a large agricultural
                            package. But their Agriculture Ministry feels that the present $440
                            million is the best estimate of additional purchases. There will be
                            another meeting tomorrow in Tokyo on this.</p>
                        <p>K: Do you control this?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: They report to me.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: This goes through State.
                            All correspondence and replies goes through State.</p>
                        <p>K: I am amazed that they haven’t leaked it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: They come to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> directly and he sends them to
                            me.</p>
                        <p>K: Can you identify things for John to push in Tokyo?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: I will give him some
                            papers.</p>
                        <p>K: Alex is working with <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                            >Ingersoll</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>
                            wants to work with me. Should we let the Japanese choose which
                            Communiqué they want. This is insanity. I want to see the State
                            Communiqué to see if it is strong enough.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: Also we need a talker
                            for the President to explain what he should say to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>.</p>
                        <p>K: Give me the talker ahead of time so that I can discuss this with the
                            Japanese so when the President makes a reference they know what he
                            means. Also, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> are diminished when they are
                            separated. They act as one person. This means <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> will be in the meetings. <pb
                                n="453" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_453"/>When the Japanese say something
                            he will be soft. Then outside he will say how tough we were. Give me a
                            talker so that I can lean on the Japanese.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: We are soon going to
                            make a “dumping” finding on Japanese textiles. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> is concerned with this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: He is personally
                            involved. He views it as a slap at him because he entered into the
                            textile agreement and agreed to quotas and then we will hit him with a
                            dumping case. Under statutes we will have to act by August 12. We must
                            go through with this or we violate our agreement. Japan thinks that just
                            because these items are under quota they can dump.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: There is one out. We can
                            accept the Japanese price assurances. We changed our policy recently and
                            now do not accept price assurances where the price difference is above a
                            minimum.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: The price difference is
                            not within the minimum.</p>
                        <p>K: Can we get this delayed? Can we reopen the case? Can we delay for six
                            weeks?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: I will go back and ask
                            about this.</p>
                        <p>K: There is only one way to get this economic stuff: 1) John, find
                            someone in Japan who represents <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> to whom I can talk and who speaks for <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>; 2) We need primary
                            negotiations. I will do this. Then when the President makes an
                            elliptical comment they will know what it means. I do not want to get
                            into negotiations. I will talk along gross categories, along the lines
                            we had in this Communiqué. We want to put relations with Japan on a new
                            basis. What is past is past and settled. And I want to tell them that no
                            leaks will be tolerated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: Then I will prepare you
                            with a talker to use with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: You want to delegate
                            that?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Flanigan</persName>: No, because there are
                            monetary issues involved.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>: There is another
                            issue—defense burden sharing. We can raise this question if we don’t
                            brutalize.</p>
                        <p>K: I have no objection to raising this since we do establish the basis
                            for going back later.</p>

                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> (who could be the next prime
                            minister) are already convinced that to maintain a cooperative
                            relationship with the U.S. is in Japan’s and their own political best
                            interest. Their immediate problem is to demonstrate that this
                            relationship brings dividends for Japan while they respond to domestic
                            pressure to undertake new departures in foreign policy with Peking and
                            Moscow. The Japanese have been at pains to reassure us that
                            normalization of relations with Peking will be sought on a basis that is
                            no threat to essential U.S. interests in Japan’s pursuit of these
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>The most important outcome of the meeting will be the tone it sets for
                            the future relationship between Japan and the United States during a
                            period of considerable flux in international relations affecting the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Objectives</p>
                        <p>—To emphasize that it is essential for the Japanese to move toward
                            elimination of the present trade imbalance between our two countries, in
                            order to maintain our close political relationship. This meeting is not
                            in any sense a negotiating session on specific items. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> will probably not be able to go
                            much beyond the positions he has already stated on economic matters.
                            However, it is important that you stress the continuing urgency and
                            importance you attach to this issue. The discussion should not be put in
                            terms of Japanese concessions to the United States, but rather on the
                            need to maintain our close political relationship, which we both desire,
                            and assure continued Japanese access to the U.S. market.</p>
                        <p>—To provide evidence both within the U.S. and Japan that we are
                            consulting with the Japanese leadership about our intentions and
                            expectations with respect to U.S. policy in Asia.</p>
                        <p>—To provide a further opportunity to make explicit to the Japanese
                            leadership that developments in U.S.–<gloss target="#t_PRC_1"

                            October to early 1973.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japanese Objectives</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> wants very much to
                            establish his relationship with the U.S., Japan’s most important ally,
                            prior to Japan’s pending negotiations with both China and the Soviet
                            Union. At the same time <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            must bear in mind that it is up to him to demonstrate a more
                            “independent” policy toward the U.S. while simultaneously stressing our
                            mutuality of interests. It would be disastrous for <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> to allow the impression to arise
                            that the U.S. was constricting the terms of Japan’s approach toward the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—The Japanese also want evidence that we acknowledge and support Japan’s
                            status as a major power. (We can provide this evidence by making it
                            clear that we support Japan’s desire for a permanent seat on the
                            Security Council.)</p>
                        <p>—The Japanese want to protect their economic position without injuring
                            U.S.-Japanese bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talks on China</p>
                        <p>—Our experience with the Chinese leaders should be shared with <persName

                            in order to provide him with a feel for the nature of negotiations with
                            the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>—We hope the Japanese will stress to the Chinese our shared view that the
                            Taiwan question should be solved “peacefully,” and that Japan intends
                            “to strengthen” its relationship with the U.S. based on the present
                            Security Treaty.</p>

                                September [1972] [3 of 4]. During the afternoon of August 19,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> met with

                            confined their comments to generalizations—there was a consensus in
                            Japan on a quick normalization, this could not be denied, Japan might
                            thus find itself with diplomatic relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> before the U.S. does, etc. It is not
                            impossible that <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> will be in
                            Peking for the October 1 <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> National
                            Day.</p>
                        <p>In consequence, Japanese relations with Taiwan will receive little or no
                            consideration, though some effort will be made to retain cultural and
                            economic ties. So preoccupied are the Japanese with normalization that
                            they displayed to me only passing interest in other political questions,
                            including even Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>It is highly likely, on the other hand, that <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> will be reasonably forthcoming on U.S.-Japanese
                            economic matters. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> told me
                            he has personally ordered his Minister to come up with an economic
                            package before Honolulu which would reduce Japan’s balance of trade
                            surplus by next March 31 by as close to $1 billion as possible. He does
                            not want to be required to discuss economics at Honolulu, and this is a
                            positive incentive. He also may feel that it is worth it to get U.S.
                            acquiescence in his approach to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>. At any rate, he spoke in general terms of purchases of
                            U.S. grain, enriched uranium aircraft, <pb n="457" facs="0488"
                                xml:id="pg_457"/>military equipment, and other agricultural and
                            industrial products to meet our needs.</p>
                        <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> did not want to be
                            pinned down as to exact amounts or time frames because the effects of
                            some Japanese purchases would not be felt until after March 31, 1973,
                            and some items would be listed in the services account rather than the
                            trade account. The important thing, he said, was to keep working toward
                            the goal of a $1 billion balance of trade reduction, which he and his
                            Ministers would do. He wanted to avoid the situation, too, in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> had found himself: being
                            accused of a breach of faith when he had only promised in effect to “do
                            his best.”</p>
                        <p>I believe that we should accept the current situation both respecting
                            Japan’s approach to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and our
                            economic relations. On China, the Japanese are determined to plunge
                            ahead, and any U.S. attempt to slow the pace will only cause them to
                            leak the fact we were doing so to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> and to the Japanese people. On economics, <persName

                            has concurred, that the contents of this package should be released
                            publicly in connection with the Honolulu meeting. Of course, <persName

                        <p>On balance, on the political side I believe that Japan’s preoccupation
                            with China will result in reduced consultations with us despite pious
                            protestations to the contrary. Nevertheless, our basic close
                            relationship should survive, even if somewhat diminished. Economically,
                            the Japanese appreciate the value of their access to the U.S. market,
                            and indeed of a stable world monetary system. They will take the
                            necessary steps to assure these goals.</p>

                                which affect the US-Japan security relationship. These include the
                                need for close cooperation under the terms of the security treaty,
                                US military operations from bases in Japan, and our security
                                relationships with the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea.
                                Although these issues have been the subject of past discussions, I
                                believe that a reiteration of our intent to uphold our security
                                commitments in the Far East, and the attendant continuing need for
                                bases in Japan, would be appropriate.” (Ibid.) In addition to this

                        <p>Your meeting with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> may present an opportunity to raise the issue of
                            our increasing concern over signs which indicate a decline in Japan’s
                            support and cooperation in the conduct of US military activities in
                            Japan. This untoward mounting trend has reached a point where it is
                            undermining the purpose of the Mutual Security Treaty, the cornerstone
                            of peace in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Although most Japanese may appreciate the importance of the US-Japan
                            security relationship for peace in Asia and the world, they must not
                            take for granted a continuation of such benefits which are threatened
                            from within by irresponsible opposition-led strikes, demonstrations and
                            impediments. Both governments must act vigorously to overcome these
                            forces and preserve a cooperative security relationship that is vital to
                            Asian security.</p>
                        <p>The United States remains dedicated to the cause of Asian security and
                            has pledged to uphold its security commitments. Effective utilization of
                            bases in Japan will continue to play an important role in our forward
                            deployment concept which is necessary to deter aggression or
                            provocation. Recent harassments and public opposition in Japan to US
                            bases and activities seem to reflect a serious gap in understanding
                            about the importance of a continuing American presence to Japanese and
                            regional security. We would hope that the new <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> administration will take the
                            necessary initiative on this issue to bring about a consensus of support
                            for a long-term US presence in Japan and East Asia.</p>
                        <p><pb n="459" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_459"/>A continued and measured US
                            military presence in Japan should not preclude gradual development of
                            Japan’s more autonomous defense capability without modification or
                            termination of the Mutual Security Treaty. Our common interest is to
                            avoid the twin specters of a defenseless Japan in the face of a nuclear
                            threat, or a necessity for a nuclear armed Japan. In this respect, the
                            US and Japan must convince China that the treaty does not constitute a
                            threat to China and that there is no necessity for Japan to produce a
                            nuclear deterrent; thus, the obstacle to a Japan-China rapprochement may
                            be removed.</p>
                        <p>The full support by the people and government of Japan of actions
                            necessary to attain our mutual objectives in Asia cannot help but
                            strengthen the bond of the Mutual Security Treaty.</p>

                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> considered the U.S.-Japan

                                >Tanaka</persName> observed that the U.S. had often been more
                            Europe-oriented in the postwar period, even though Japan had been firmer
                            in support of the U.S. leadership role. I pointed out that you, in
                            contrast, were very Asia-oriented<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4"><persName

                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> set himself the goal of a
                            serious effort to reduce the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance to $3 billion by
                            March 31, the end of the current Japanese fiscal year. (His figures
                            showed the current imbalance as $3.2 billion; ours showed $3.6–3.8
                            billion.)</p>
                        <p>—He cautioned that not all the short-term measures the Japanese would
                            take would necessarily show up in the figures for this fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>—He had instructed his officials to work out long-term measures to
                            “stabilize” our economic relationship over a period of two to three
                            years. He mentioned increased purchases of agricultural and advanced
                            industrial products; central bank lending; bilateral consultative
                            mechanisms; and joint efforts with us to stabilize our trade position in
                            the multilateral framework.</p>

                        <p>—In areas where the U.S. has made a “great sacrifice for peace”
                            (Southeast Asia, Korea), Japan was interested in providing economic

                        <p>—He asked about Vietnam, and I gave him a brief account of the military

                        <p>—He expressed concern that we might withdraw troops from Korea, and I
                            assured him we had no plans to.</p>
                        <p>—There was now a consensus in Japan on the need to normalize relations

                            your Peking Summit). But <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            would not do it on an unconditional basis. China had a long-standing
                            historical and cultural attraction to Japan—but the U.S. tie was
                            stronger.</p>
                        <p>—Japan was becoming cautious now about joint U.S.-Japanese oil
                            investments in Siberia, because of apparent <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"

                            and I agreed that our experts should exchange ideas on the whole project

                                effectiveness with respect to the defense of Taiwan. We would also
                                like to see Japan maintain at least cultural and economic relations
                                with Taiwan.” In response to Japanese concerns, <persName

                        <p>We have four principal objectives at the Honolulu meeting:</p>
                        <p>—To reaffirm the US-Japan alliance, not only as a general
                            proposition—which <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            accepts—but also as a relationship which requires concrete contributions
                            by both sides to keep it going. E.g., while we furnish nuclear
                            protection, the Japanese must make it possible for us to use Japanese
                            bases. This reaffirmation will be especially important coming just
                            before <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s Peking visit and
                            Japan’s opening of peace treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>—To assure that Japan’s moves to normalize relations with Peking will not
                            inhibit our use of our Japanese bases in fulfillment of our defense
                            commitments to Taiwan and South Korea. (We also want to encourage Japan
                            to preserve its economic and cultural ties with Taiwan.)</p>
                        <p>—To agree on a Japanese commitment to reduce our bilateral trade deficit
                            to less than $3 billion by the end of this Japanese Fiscal Year <pb

                            from Japan specific measures by which Japan will bring about this
                                reduction.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">In an August 17 memorandum to
                                the President, <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                                asserted, “The strength of the Japanese economy requires that they
                                assume greater responsibility for global equilibrium. This
                                responsibility can be best met by an increased effort on their part
                                to open Japan’s market to the world. There is great danger that
                                domestic pressure will force the U.S. to take more restrictive
                                measures against Japanese imports unless they move more quickly.
                                Clearly this would have an adverse impact on our political relations
                                at this critical period.” (Ibid.) A second memorandum from <persName

                                against symbolic actions that appeared to resolve U.S.-Japanese
                                trade conflicts without actually doing so, and advised <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> against committing his
                                prestige to support of the present dollar-yen exchange rate. See

                        <p>—To establish via your personal contacts with the new Japanese leaders an
                            atmosphere of “lift” in US-Japanese relations which will carry us into a
                            mature and close relationship over the long term.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">A.</hi> Background</p>
                        <p>US-Japanese relations are now in transition between an era of dependency
                            and an era of greater Japanese self-assertion. Particularly with Japan’s
                            vigorous new leadership, parallelism of policy is no longer
                            automatic—even though <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            considers US and Japanese ultimate interests as “identical.” There is a
                            danger of Japan’s moving in a nationalist direction, and responding to
                            domestic pressures, behind a facade of continuing friendship for us.
                            This has shown up, for example, in:</p>
                        <p>—increasing restrictions on movements of our forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>—the new government’s haste to normalize relations with Peking.</p>
                        <p>—leaks in the press hinting at the need for changes in the US-Japan
                            Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the fundamentals of the US-Japan relationship are
                            sound:</p>
                        <p>—Japan’s interests were not at all impaired by your Peking visit, and you
                            in fact reaffirmed our tie with Japan in the Shanghai Communiqué. This
                            was well received in Japan.</p>
                        <p>—Okinawa Reversion, a basic Japanese goal, was accomplished on schedule,
                            in fulfillment of your promise.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>’s succession by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> was accomplished in a way that
                            did not directly or significantly embroil the US. And <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> has repeatedly reaffirmed the
                            continuity of <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> policy.</p>
                        <p><pb n="463" facs="0494" xml:id="pg_463"/>—The Japanese are beginning to
                            accept responsibility for a significant share of the US-Japan trade
                            deficit, and to assist in our determination to reduce it
                            substantially.</p>
                        <p>Thus your principal task at Honolulu is to make sure that the Japanese
                            are aware of our interests and that they understand that our common
                            objectives must be the basic framework for our respective independent
                            policies. You should try to convey this more by your demeanor than by
                            explicit words—which they might leak. The Japanese may be seeking an
                            atmospheric harmony at Honolulu which they would then use as a mandate
                            to go off on their own. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            lacks experience in foreign policy and is susceptible to domestic
                            pressures. But the US alliance has always been Japan’s secure anchor in
                            the world. Thus Honolulu is a timely opportunity for you to impress upon
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> the importance of
                            preserving the substantive harmony of our policies over the long
                            term.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Reaffirmation with <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                    >Tanaka</persName> of the US-Japanese Alliance.</hi> Both in his
                            public statements and in his conversation August 19 with me, he leaves
                            little doubt that in principle he understands the importance of the
                            alliance to Japan’s national interest. On several occasions he has
                            invoked the metaphor of the “closely-knit family relationship.” But it
                            still needs to be established that <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> will conduct his policy concretely in a way that
                            preserves this unity. This is particularly true on the security side,
                            where we cannot acquiesce in further Japanese restrictions on our access
                            to our bases. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> is quite conversant with the basic economic
                            issues (from his experience as Finance Minister and Minister of
                            International Trade and Industry), and can discuss them in considerable
                            detail. (A biographical piece on <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"

                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> depends on him very heavily for
                            advice on the political and security areas of foreign policy, due both
                            to <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s inexperience and to
                            the instrumental role that <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>
                            played in <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s election. This
                            last factor alone gives <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> an
                            important voice, and it is possible that he would like to succeed
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> as Prime Minister. He
                            gives the impression of being an ambitious and uncommunicative man.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>, having served both as
                            Foreign Minister (1962–64) and as International Trade and Industry
                            Minister (1968–70), is well-acquainted with the intricacies of the
                            issues. Substantively, he also subscribes to our alliance as the major
                            premise of Japan’s foreign policy. Within the past year, however, he has
                            been urging that Japan act more independently of the US, in the
                            interests of Japanese “equality.” <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Ohira</persName> can be difficult to deal with, given his extreme
                            caution and avoidance of taking controversial positions; he frequently
                            resorts to studied ambiguity.</p>

                            too bad to have a man as Prime Minister who has an economic background.
                            We are Japan’s biggest customer, and next to Canada, Japan is our
                            biggest customer. Our most important export to Japan is agricultural
                            products.</p>
                        <p>I have here the draft of the economic agreement which we expect to reach
                            at Hawaii. Japanese purchases of over $1 billion are reflected
                                here.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">On August 9, <persName

                            additional $50 million over what the Japanese had already agreed to
                            buy—and there is also a purchase of $320 million worth of wide-bodied
                            aircraft. Some of this will be paid in advance, but the question is how
                            to arrange for it. There is also an item of $20 million for the purchase
                            of helicopters.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes, Mr. President,
                            there will be a purchase of $320 million worth of uranium, with some of
                            this paid in advance also.</p>
                        <p>The President: It’s not so important what the individual items are on the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: The agreement speaks
                            of Japanese investment of from $500 million to $1 billion in a uranium
                            separation plant to be operated jointly with U.S. interests. <gloss

                        <p>The President: Are the French and the Germans participating in gaseous
                            diffusion technology with us?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: If they want to
                            purchase gaseous diffusion technology, we are prepared to sell. There
                            has been some talk of the Japanese going into partnership with the
                            Canadians, too.</p>
                        <p>The President: On the key point of the Japanese recognizing the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and breaking off relations with
                            Taiwan, how soon will they kick Taiwan out?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: It looks like
                            if Japan wants to have diplomatic relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, it will need to break up with Taiwan.
                            What kind of relationship Japan will maintain afterwards with Taiwan
                            depends on the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> attitude, and what
                            they’ll require. The Japanese want to keep private trade with Taiwan. I
                            told <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> that this was
                            important from our standpoint, but I made it clear that we anticipated
                            nothing would happen at the Hawaii meetings which would delay things in
                            their approach to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: Mr. President,
                            I told them it’s our position that it’s “your decision,” and we weren’t
                            in any position to discourage or encourage what they did as long as they
                            were not acquiescing in any arrangement which would interfere in our
                            ability to use our bases in Japan to defend Taiwan. I also said, “you
                            should keep quiet about this. It’s a hell of a problem for us, but if
                            you brief the press that the President said it was okay for you to break
                            relations with Taiwan, that would be very bad.”</p>
                        <p>The President: I agree—we can’t have them say that publicly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Based on my
                            experience with them, they’ll leak it to the press and tell the Chinese
                            about it anyway.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: But we won’t
                            look as if we made a silent gesture to them to go ahead. We should take
                            the position that the U.S. explained our policy to them and they
                            listened, and they did the same for us.</p>
                        <p>The President: Yes. We should tell them that “what you’re doing you’re
                            doing in your own interests, and we’ve consulted our interests
                            also.”</p>

                                >Green</persName>: We have told the Japanese that we assume they
                            would do nothing to interfere with our ability to deliver on our
                            commitments. We have also told the Japanese that they have a good
                            bargaining position, and can stand up to the Chinese with respect to
                            Taiwan. They (the Japanese) are beginning to catch on, although they
                            will surely normalize relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> before the end of the year. But Peking is now anxious,
                            and the Chinese haven’t maintained their preconditions for several
                            months. Perhaps they are worried about better Japanese relations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President: Who, the Chinese?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: Yes, they want to sew
                            Japan up, and strike while the iron is hot—while there is a China mood
                            in Japan. They are smart, too. They know that if there are too many
                            preconditions, they will get the Japanese backs up. In addition, there
                            are people in Japan such as <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"

                        <p>The President: What role are the Russians playing?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: The Soviets are being
                            fairly quiet on this. They are standing back. They want to sign a peace
                            treaty with Japan, but the Japanese won’t sign because of those four
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right—the
                            Japanese won’t sign unless they get those four islands.</p>
                        <p>The President: Are the Russians hoping to increase their trade with
                            Japan?</p>
                        <p>(At this point there was a general discussion of Japanese interests in
                            helping to exploit Siberian resources in cooperation with the Soviets
                            and possibly with the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: What the Japanese
                            particularly want out of Siberia is to exploit natural gas and oil
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: Japan has more
                            trade with China than all European countries put together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: With respect to the
                            Taiwan clause, and the effect of Japanese recognition of the <gloss

                        <p>The President: The Japanese can’t have it all their own way. They want to
                            be independent, and do things on their own without telling us, but our
                            access to the bases is essential. (To Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>) I’ve read the papers which you
                            sent me on this, Bill, and they were very good. We’ve gone pretty far,
                            it seems to me, with respect to the Japanese.</p>

                            don’t have to break relations with Taiwan, though, because the U.S. has
                            the power.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: There is no

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: There is a lot said
                            in the U.S. among businessmen about economic issues in U.S.-Japan
                            relations, but the words they use are color words and don’t necessarily
                            mean relations are bad.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: Yes, the

                        <p>The President: That’s because we’re so competitive with them (the

                        <p>(The President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            exchanged brief remarks on the Emperor’s visit next year to the United

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: Mr. President, it’s an
                            interesting thing that in Korea, our stand makes the Japanese the
                            principle beneficiaries. This is also true in Southeast Asia. By the
                            same token, even on our China policy the Japanese are the principal
                            beneficiaries. We protect their interests on Taiwan, while they discuss
                            normalization of relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>. They are also playing the Soviets against Peking, and as a
                            result have better relations with both.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: You know, Mr.
                            President, I don’t like all this talk of the “<persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> shocks.” This makes it seem that
                            there are problems in our relations with Japan which just aren’t
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The President: All this is done now.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: What we should
                            talk about is how good our relations are, not about how bad they
                            are.</p>
                        <p>The President: I think you’re right, Bill. A good place to do that would
                            be at the dinner tomorrow night when we are all sitting around the
                            table. I could subtly ease in the idea that we all know we’ve got good
                            relations, but should say so publicly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Yes, only this might
                            not be picked up by the press. The Japanese press is very
                            anti-government.</p>
                        <p><pb n="470" facs="0501" xml:id="pg_470"/>The President: Like ours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Worse. One way for
                            the Japanese press to attack the government is to attack us.</p>
                        <p>The President: The Japanese people read a lot, and have good
                            newspapers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: It’s
                            humiliating the way Japanese have treated us on this matter of
                            normalizing relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.
                            They have talked to us for months and months, but have told us very
                            little.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ve certainly
                            told them more about our intentions than they have told us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: If everything
                            we say is on the positive side, though, this will suggest that other
                            things are all over.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Just as the
                            President said.</p>
                        <p>The President: We should steer around the problem areas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is one thing
                            we should be very careful about. Although we might want to be good to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> in a general way, we should be
                            tough on Taiwan. When I met with <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> in Karuizawa,<note n="5" xml:id="d130fn5"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> met with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> at Karuizawa on
                                August 19. See <ref target="#d126fn2">Document 126, footnote
                                2</ref>, and for a summary of the conversation, see <ref
                                    target="#d128">Document 128</ref>.</note> he wanted to amend the
                            Security Treaty. I said that this would affect our whole
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>The President: I agree, we should be tough on this point. We’re already
                            paying the price for our military reductions in that area. A $30 billion
                            defense cut would leave us with no policy at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: With respect to
                            economic policy, my approach to Diet members who call on me is that
                            maintaining the market in the U.S. is very important in Japan, and that
                            it’s in their interests to continue to do so.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: This is a good
                            rationale, but they’ve heard it so much they don’t believe it
                            anymore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> is good on economics, and is
                            determined not to get into the same fix that <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"
                                >Sato</persName> found himself in over textiles. He doesn’t want to
                            get pinned down to a specific commitment on cutting down Japan’s trade
                            imbalance with us, but he will try very hard to get a substantial
                            decrease in the imbalance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: Japanese trade with
                            Taiwan is more than that with Mainland China. In addition, the Japanese
                            sell much more to the Chinese on Taiwan than they buy from them—they
                            have a very favorable trade balance.</p>
                        <p><pb n="471" facs="0502" xml:id="pg_471"/>The President: The Japanese must
                            realize that if they continue on their present route, they will have
                            serious problems with the American Congress and are likely to end up
                            with quotas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: This is what I’m
                            trying to tell them!</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: The Japanese are weak
                            on Korea and on Taiwan. Right now, we’re trying to keep the Republic of
                            China in the IFI’s—the issue is coming up on September 25, when the
                            Executive Committee meets, and we’re working behind the scenes to head
                            it off. We are trying a strategy of keeping it from coming to a
                            substantive vote. If there is a vote, the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1"
                                >ROC</gloss> would be out. Bob McNamara and Schweitzer are
                            cooperating with us on that. On the Japanese side, this is a matter
                            where we would deal more with <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> than with <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Ohira</persName>. It’s a place where the Japanese are weak.</p>
                        <p>One other thing we are trying to do is to keep the Korean issue out of
                            the U.N. this fall.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName> reviewed for the
                            President the Korean situation and the elements of the Korean issue in
                            the U.N.) This also is a case where the Japanese tend to stand back and
                            not take a position. It’s a subject for <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Ohira</persName>, not for <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: What is the
                            situation now?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: The Japanese say that
                            they will support postponement of the debate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: How strong are the
                            Chinese on this (the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>)?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Pretty strong. (To
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>) We talked about
                            that at Karuizawa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: The Japanese are
                            looking toward closer relations with North Korea, and get the South
                            Koreans very nervous over this. It is a situation where they are
                            prepared to go faster than we think is wise.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: When the two
                            Koreas are getting along better, the worst thing we could have happen is
                            to get the issue into the U.N.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Chinese will
                            insist on having a debate. I understand that the North Koreans called in
                            Ambassadors of the countries which maintain relations with Pyongyang and
                            told them that they might be obliged to depart unless they supported the
                            North Korean resolution. This was to keep these countries from falling
                            off. I don’t think that <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            will understand all of the details of this issue, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> will. But one thing that
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> was very strong about
                            when I talked with him in Tokyo was that we should keep our forces in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I agree that this is
                            his position.</p>
                        <p>The President: It’s an interesting thing. I’m sitting here thinking that
                            just three years ago I was on my way to Midway, where we made our first
                            stinking little increment in our withdrawal from Vietnam of <pb n="472"
                                facs="0503" xml:id="pg_472"/>25,000 men, and the Chiefs screamed.
                            Today we have less men in Vietnam than we have in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is because of
                            the improved situation.</p>
                        <p>The President: Three years is a long time. How many troops do we have in
                            Korea? 43,000? (The others assured the President that this was the
                            correct figure.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>: It’s all to your
                            credit, Mr. President, that the South-North talks are taking place.
                            Without your approach to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, this
                            never would have happened. The North Koreans and South Koreans have even
                            gotten together at the Olympics.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>: With respect to
                            withdrawals from Vietnam, the military are now your strong
                            supporters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: On the security
                            issue, Mr. President, there is talk now among the Japanese that with the
                            relaxation of tensions they don’t need the Security Treaty. The line
                            I’ve taken is that the developments taking place in the area, such as
                            your approach to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and the Korean
                            talks, are not despite the Security Treaty but because of it. Therefore,
                            we don’t want to dismantle it permanently.</p>
                        <p>The President: I agree. All these things are very inter-related. If we
                            didn’t have the Security Treaty, the North Koreans would not be worth
                            talking to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: I agree, Mr.
                            President, and the people I’ve talked to understand this. They agree
                            that <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is important and that we
                            should not withdraw our forces, and the same is true with respect to
                            Japan. <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> talks about no
                            withdrawal of forces, but of maintaining our troop levels.</p>
                        <p>The President: Let me say, if we do withdraw from Japan, Japan has had
                            it!</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Everytime I talk
                            to <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>, he speaks about the
                            great humiliation we gave to them during the Occupation. He talks about
                            elements in the Constitution which were forced upon them by political
                            scientists working on MacArthur’s staff, for example the anti-war
                            clause, and made it plain that he personally resented this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>: Henry, you’ve said
                            one thing to me about <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>
                            which is very important. Hitherto all the Japanese leaders we’ve dealt
                            with have been in the Yoshida tradition, in which maintaining good
                            U.S.-Japanese relations was an emotional thing. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> comes to this same conclusion
                            about good U.S.-Japanese relations, but more from intellectual than
                            emotional reasons.</p>
                        <p>(At this point the President dismissed those present and the meeting
                            broke up.)</p>

                        <p>The President greeted the Prime Minister at the entrance to the Kuilima
                            Hotel and escorted him up to his suite on the sixth floor.</p>
                        <p>After the press photographers had taken pictures and departed, the Prime
                            Minister began the conversation by thanking the President for his kind
                            invitation to this meeting in Hawaii. Even before receiving it, he said,
                            he had been planning to call on the President at the earliest
                            opportunity after organizing his new government. He thanked the

                        <p>The Prime Minister then conveyed a personal message of appreciation from

                            further strengthened.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also conveyed respects on behalf of former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, as well as his
                            heartfelt appreciation to the President for effecting the reversion of
                            Okinawa to Japan. <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> hopes to
                            find an opportunity before too long, he added, to visit Washington and
                            thank the President personally.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would be pleased to welcome former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> to Washington as an
                            old friend any time that he would find convenient to come.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked him for this response.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that his own warmest regards and respect be conveyed
                            to <gloss target="#t_HIM_1">HIM</gloss> The Emperor. Now that the
                            invitation has been extended and accepted he said that he looks forward
                            to welcoming <gloss target="#t_HIM_1">HIM</gloss> The Emperor to
                            Washington on an official state visit whenever a mutually convenient
                            time can be worked out through the appropriate channels.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the subject of visits, the President added, after the
                            elections, at some time during the coming year he hoped also to welcome
                            the Prime Minister on a visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>If this appeared to be a great many visits, the President explained, it
                            underscored the necessity for continuing to have constant contacts
                            between the leaders of both nations not just as official duties but also
                            because of the deep friendship between both countries.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed enthusiastically.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that while the Prime Minister’s plane was landing
                            last evening, he recalled his own several trips to Japan, many of which
                            were made during the 1960s, while he was out of office. He also recalled
                            having the opportunity to know personally five Prime Ministers of Japan,
                            including Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>.
                            He saw Prime Minister Yoshida in Japan in 1953, followed by Prime
                            Ministers <persName corresp="#p_KN_1">Kishi</persName>, Ikeda, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, and now Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>. He recalled feeling
                            that his personal friendship for Japanese Prime Ministers is not
                            exceeded in our relations with any other country.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he understood this feeling.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that he feels it most important for both
                            countries that the chiefs of state of each meet, and said that he would
                            welcome the opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that former Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, in addition to his official
                            contacts, had a personal channel of communication with Dr. <persName

                            his own choosing. He <pb n="475" facs="0506" xml:id="pg_475"/>hoped that
                            the Prime Minister would wish also to maintain such contact.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he agreed completely. He expressed
                            appreciation that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            came to Karuizawa to consult with him recently about this visit.<note

                            able to meet the President again so soon, not only for official talks
                            but also because of the personal friendship involved. He stressed his
                            belief in the necessity for constant communication. All Japanese, he
                            said, know and appreciate the fact that the President is the first one
                            born on the Pacific coast, and the fact that he feels so close to
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that it is generally said that former Prime
                            Ministers Ikeda and <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> are
                            products of the “Yoshida school,” but he pointed out that he entered the

                            <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>, he said, was elected to the

                            the difference in their ages. Ikeda was his senior by eight years and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> by seventeen.
                            Nevertheless, he said, all shared in the same general flow of thought in
                            Japan, having been nurtured in the “Yoshida school.” Yoshida stressed
                            that Japan’s relations with the United States and the United Kingdom
                            were of the utmost importance to his foreign policy for Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled being driven by the President in a golf cart
                            from the Western White House to Casa Pacifica and said that he feels he
                            should learn to drive a golf cart so he can welcome the President in the
                            same style.</p>
                        <p>The President said that golf carts are easy to drive, and safe, and save
                            walking on the golf course.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then recalled telling Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> recently that constant contact, both official
                            and unofficial, is very important.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that the

                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled, in connection with economics, that he also
                            said Japan must have a strong American economy. The fundamental view of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> is that American prosperity
                            means Japanese prosperity. While the current economic problems could not
                            be resolved <pb n="476" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_476"/>in one move, he
                            expressed the belief that constant communication, with meetings between
                            officials and experts every month if necessary, while keeping watch on
                            long-term trends would lead to a smooth solution satisfactory to both
                            sides.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that one of the reasons he appointed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> is that we need in
                            Japan a businessman with a good economic background. The Prime Minister,
                            he noted, has not only achieved success in business but has the further
                            qualification of having served as Finance Minister and Minister of
                            International Trade and Industry.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he appreciated the appointment of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>, who could foresee
                            problems in all aspects of the relationship, not just economic ones. It
                            was, he said, a happy choice, since he is an expert in economic affairs.
                            The Prime Minister said that he knew Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> many years before, having
                            met him through <persName corresp="#p_KDM_2">David Kennedy</persName>,
                            when he was still head of Continental Illinois. He noted that he had, as
                            Finance Minister some years ago, approved the establishment of
                            Continental Illinois’ branches in Tokyo and Kobe.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister cautioned that trade negotiations through government
                            channels only tended to develop into item-by-item negotiations, and
                            pointed out that it is more effective to have consultations between
                            specialists, with a view toward expansion of long-term balanced trade to
                            the mutual advantage of both countries. Therefore, he appreciated the
                            fact that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>
                            does not confine himself to official contacts with himself and the
                            Foreign Minister, but also speaks broadly to the business community in
                            Japan, which understands him so well.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he knows negotiations to resolve the great
                            imbalance in our trade are difficult. He is glad to hear there is some
                            progress. He also understood that the counterparts are discussing the
                            technical points in the other meeting. He emphasized that a skilled and
                            experienced politician would understand that the present trade imbalance
                            might appear to be advantageous to Japan, but if allowed to grow could
                            lead to rising protectionism in the Congress. We should understand, he
                            said, that it is in our mutual interest to resolve this trade imbalance
                            as much as possible so as to prevent any move toward restriction issues,
                            but rather to provide for freer trade, which is in the interest of both
                            Japan and the United States, which are great economic powers. He
                            realized that some Japanese businessmen, like our own, would tend to
                            take a negative attitude toward any actions taken which they thought
                            would result in a detriment to their own short-range interests. However,
                            in viewing the long-term, he stressed that we as political leaders must
                            create conditions which encourage the reduction of barriers. This, he
                            said, we can do only if the members of the Diet <pb n="477" facs="0508"
                                xml:id="pg_477"/>and of our own Congress are convinced of the
                            long-term interest to both countries of redressing the balance. Japan’s
                            businessmen and manufacturers are competitive and efficient, he said,
                            and our own businessmen and manufacturers have that reputation.
                            Therefore, we should welcome competition, and as political leaders he
                            said both of us should do all we can to see that barriers are not
                            raised. Therefore the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> moves to
                            reduce the present trade imbalance would have, he believed, a salutary
                            effect on both public opinion and in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that an excessive imbalance in trade did not
                            serve either nation, and is undesirable. Therefore, he wished to do his
                            best to reduce the current imbalance. Japan would make specific efforts
                            to reduce the imbalance, in order to continue to benefit from expanding
                            trade. However, he did not believe this matter could be solved in half a
                            year, or a year. Having served as Minister of Finance some three years,
                            as an <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> policy-maker, and also as
                            Minister of International Trade and Industry for a year, he felt he is
                            qualified as an expert. While in office, therefore, he said he wishes to
                            bring about an “ideal situation.” While continuing to consult between
                            governments, he said the Government of Japan would also continue its
                            efforts to persuade business to accept necessary measures. The Prime
                            Minister added that the President’s term of office is four years, but
                            his own term as <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> President is only
                            three.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he is young, the youngest to serve as a Minister
                            and also to serve as Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was also the youngest man to serve as a
                            Diet member, but pointed out that long life does not depend on
                            chronological age. While the President could serve eight years, he could
                            serve as <gloss target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> President only six years
                            (two three-year terms).</p>
                        <p>The President asked if that is all he could serve.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that this is all, unless <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> party regulations are amended, or
                            unless he stepped down after two terms and later ran for another
                            term.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he views Japan-U.S. economic problems as
                            being important. Therefore, he has been meeting with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWD_1">Eberle</persName>, and wishes to bring
                            about some conclusion. Japan’s entire post-war economic recovery has
                            been based on the dollar, he said, and therefore the maintenance of the
                            value of the dollar and continued growth of the American economy are
                            also in the interest of Japan, insomuch as these contribute to the
                            maintenance of world peace and the position of the free world. Japan, he
                            said, wishes to cooperate in the interest of expanding the American
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>The President said this is mutual. A strong, healthy Japanese economy is
                            in our interest. He realized that Japan has a special problem <pb
                                n="478" facs="0509" xml:id="pg_478"/>with respect to playing a
                            military role in the Pacific and Asia, but Japanese economic influence
                            could be decisive in many areas. Therefore, it is in our interest that
                            there be a strong, vigorous Japanese economy, so that Japan could play a
                            vital role in Southeast Asia, which would help develop the whole region,
                            and would be decisive. He commented that the Prime Minister would read
                            in the press statements reflecting the feeling by some of our political
                            leaders and businessmen that Japan is a serious competitor to be dealt
                            with, but noted that he does not share their feelings. Healthy
                            competition benefits both nations, he believes, except, of course, when
                            the trade imbalance is too great.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he wished to discuss the healthy balance of
                            trade noted by the President. Within two or three years Japan wishes to
                            restrain its surplus on current account to one percent of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, which would be used to finance
                            economic aid of one percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> to
                            the LDCs. Moreover, of that amount the Government of Japan wishes to
                            reach the ideal level of 0.7% of governmental developmental assistance
                            as soon as possible. It is said by some that Japan has attained economic
                            affluence, he said, but this is not true. There is an excessive
                            concentration of population in urban centers, such as Tokyo and Osaka,
                            which gives rise to many problems like pollution and inadequate housing.
                            Japan lags behind the United States in social capital formation, he
                            said, and great investments are needed for social capital and to improve
                            living conditions. Thus, great domestic investments must be made, as
                            well as large contributions to economic assistance to the LDCs. He said
                            that the Government of Japan hopes to move forward toward realizing both
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Prime Minister added that Japan should cooperate
                            with the Southeast Asian nations and the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> in providing both aid and investment. When the tensions
                            in Vietnam have been reduced, he said that Japan should also provide aid
                            and investments to help stabilize the lives of the people. He noted
                            Japan’s promise at <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> to attain
                            the goal of governmental aid of 0.7% of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1"
                                >GNP</gloss> by the end of the decade. This would equal the entire
                            budget to support the Government of Japan Defense Forces. While this is
                            a difficult objective, he said the Government of Japan should tell the
                            people this aid is essential, and gain their understanding. With the
                            cooperation of the United States over the past quarter of a century
                            Japan has achieved great economic progress and Japan now wishes to
                            assume a larger burden in contributing to peace and the development of
                            the LDCs, on the basis of full consultation with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that this, of course, is in the interest of Japan as
                            well as the United States, as a Pacific power. Healthy, growing
                            economies in Indonesia, Thailand and Indochina, as well as India,
                            Pakistan and Bangladesh if that time could come, would be most help<pb
                                n="479" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_479"/>ful. Whenever the level of the
                            lowest is raised, he noted, the level of the highest often benefits
                            most.</p>
                        <p>One other point the President wished to make, which Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has heard him make to
                            European leaders, is that Japan’s role is not limited only to the
                            Pacific, but that Japan is a world economic power. If we look at the
                            world’s power centers we find the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, Japan and Western Europe. Therefore he noted the
                            importance of Japan and the United States cooperating not just with each
                            other, but also together with the Western European nations, England,
                            France and the other <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> nations, so as
                            not to simply limit our actions principally to the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed. Japan also wishes to cooperate with the
                            enlarged <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss>. However, he noted, while
                            Japan has expanded its economy greatly since the war, Japan does not yet
                            stand on an equal footing with some of these nations. For example, in
                            the UNSC, and he feared that if Japan makes the first move the Europeans
                            will react strongly. If the U.S. would, in a sense, “introduce” Japan
                            and help moderate European reactions, then he felt that Japan could be
                            helpful in many areas.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could tell how, before the meetings in China,
                            he had discussed this very subject with <persName corresp="#p_HE_1"
                                >Heath</persName>, Pompidou and Brandt, that is, that Japan could
                            play a role along with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted, that the
                            President, in fact, had a most intense discussion of this very point
                            with <persName corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName>. He added that the
                            President has given him orders to keep in close touch with the Prime
                            Minister prior to <persName corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName>’s visit
                            to Tokyo, September 16.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed with the President’s point that it is in both
                            Japan’s and the United States’ self-interest to keep in touch with
                            respect to the newly enlarged <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss>,
                            which would constitute a powerful economic structure.</p>
                        <p>The President reemphasized the desirability of the United States and
                            Japan working closely together in their contacts with the leaders of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> nations. Obviously he did not
                            mean that neither nation would join the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1"
                                >EEC</gloss>, but it would be in our mutual interest to work closely
                            together in expanding trade with Europe. Since both Japan and the United
                            States have vigorious economies, and look outward rather than inward, it
                            is in our common interest to work to ensure that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> does not turn inward.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed. He noted some concern over the undesirable
                            possibility that the expanded <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> might
                            develop its own “Monroe Doctrine” and develop its own internal trade
                            after January 1 when the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> enters the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss>. Therefore he agreed on the
                            desirability of <pb n="480" facs="0511" xml:id="pg_480"/>maintaining
                            close contact between Japan and the European nations to ensure that the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> not move in the direction of
                            contracting world trade, and further to consult with them on economic
                            assistance to the LDCs. However strong the United States might be, with
                            the example of Vietnam in mind, he felt that it is better to persuade
                            the free world nations to maintain close ties, especially since both the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> are seeking to expand their influence around the world.
                            Thus, he felt that Japan and the United States should maintain
                            communications with the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> nations in
                            the interest of all the free nations.</p>
                        <p>The President noted the Prime Minister’s forthcoming visit to Peking and
                            wondered if he could give an evaluation of what he foresees developing
                            in the way of relations between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="d131fn5">On August 11, <persName

                            he did not suggest that policies of our two countries should be
                            identical for he realized that the Prime Minister served the interests
                            of Japan, just as we serve our own nation’s interests. On the other
                            hand, our view, (which he felt that the Prime Minister reflected in his
                            recent talks with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            at Karuizawa) is that it is of overriding importance to both the United
                            States and Japan that we not get into a conflict over China policy,
                            while we need not have identical positions, he cautioned that neither

                                their Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Tsurumi wants to meet with me

                        <p>The Prime Minister stated two conclusions with respect to China policy.
                            First, Japan would not consider any restoration of diplomatic relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> that would be
                            disadvantageous to Japan-United States relations. Second, it would be
                            ultimately in the interest of the United States as well if Japan could
                            normalize its relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.
                            He noted that containment, for example of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>, is one means to weaken its power, but on the other
                            hand it could also serve the cause of world peace to open a window to
                            the world for the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. The effect of
                            this latter kind of policy could be seen vis-à-vis the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In terms of the reality of the
                            great population and low standard of living <pb n="481" facs="0512"
                                xml:id="pg_481"/>of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, he did
                            not believe containment to be an effective policy, because whenever a
                            nation with a low standard of living closed itself to the world (or was
                            contained) it caused the people to unite, and in the case of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> brings about such developments as
                            providing rear area assistance to North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, in evaluating the effect of the President’s visit to
                            Peking, felt that one visible effect is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is not now extending such aid to North
                            Vietnam even though the United States has intensified its “carpet
                            bombing.” In examining the United States-North Vietnam policy, the Prime
                            Minister stated his personal view is that the President had established
                            a “pipeline” for communication during his visits to Peking and Moscow,
                            on the basis of which he personally anticipates an early resolution of
                            the war, which efforts he applauds.</p>
                        <p>Turning back to Japan’s relations with China, the Prime Minister said
                            they are neighbors, but have had a number of conflicts during the
                            hundred years following the Meiji Restoration (1867). The domestic
                            situation within Japan has now developed to the point, he said where it
                            is almost impossible for Japan not to normalize relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, even though there may not be
                            such “merit” in this as Japan’s mass media or public opinion
                            believes.</p>
                        <p>The President interjected “or our press either.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister observed that the popular tide favoring normalization
                            could not be dammed up. Even though there may be no particular advantage
                            (“merit”) to normalization, he did not foresee any great disadvantage,
                            of the kind to which the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> should be
                            alert. Personally he did not see such a disadvantage. One major problem,
                            he admitted, is Taiwan, but if Japan did open a “diplomatic path” to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, it could avoid incurring the
                            kind of strong enmity of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> which
                            it did while following a policy of containment. Further examples of the
                            benefit of opening relations were that Japan could urge the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> not to send any aid to North Vietnam,
                            or not to liberate Taiwan by force, or not to send aid to <gloss
                                target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss> on the same basis as the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, that is, arms to promote disorders.
                            Further, Japan could conduct normal trade with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, and thus avoid the situation in which
                            the memorandum Trade Office necessary to conduct trade now interferes in
                            Japan’s domestic affairs. Opposed to these advantages, he conceded the
                            political difficulties related to Taiwan, but observed that leaving
                            relations which China in their present form must be considered in terms
                            of increasing Soviet involvement and actions, for example, the large
                            naval force the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> maintains at
                            Vladivostak across the Sea of Japan, ships of which pass freely through
                            the Straits of Korea to the South China Sea. The problem of Taiwan and
                            its relationship to the Soviets is delicate, he said, but Japan would
                            not be deeply concerned if the United States maintained its presence in
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p><pb n="482" facs="0513" xml:id="pg_482"/>The Prime Minister observed that
                            Japan and the United States have different views of China, Japan seeing
                            her as a close neighbor while the United States looks at it from across
                            the Pacific. In much the same way as the United States knows all about
                            its close neighbor, Latin America, Japan knows too much about China. He
                            concluded by stating that it is impossible for Japan to continue not
                            having relations with China.</p>
                        <p>The President wished to tell the Prime Minister that he received a
                            private message this morning from Thailand’s Prime Minister Thanom
                            requesting that he raise his (Thanom’s) concern with the Prime Minister
                            with particular respect to Taiwan’s economic position and investments
                            there, and the need to preserve Taiwan’s position.</p>
                        <p>The President specifically noted that we and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> “agreed to disagree” on Taiwan in the Shanghai
                            Communiqué. He assured the Prime Minister that we would do all we can in
                            the economic front to help the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> keep
                            its seat in the International Financial Institutions, and to help keep
                            Taiwan a viable, strong economic power. He noted that the leaders in
                            Taiwan obviously would be watching closely the Prime Minister’s visit to
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. He realized that this is a
                            difficult problem for us, as for the Government of Japan, in view of the
                            extensive political, military, economic and personal ties with Taiwan,
                            but added that both of us recognize, for different reasons, that we must
                            begin the difficult process of working out some kind of relationship
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would not presume to tell the Prime Minister
                            what to do; but offered to note on the basis of our experience in Peking
                            and Moscow some essential principles to keep in mind in dealing with the
                            leaders of these Communist governments. First of all they are pragmatic.
                            In both capitals Japan is respected highly for its great economic power.
                            Therefore Japan need not seek relations as a supplicant. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was our first expert and he
                            was the second to discover that improved relations depended on mutual
                            respect and frankness. We talk to them for reasons of our own, and they
                            with us for reasons of their own, he said, which is similar to the
                            position of Japan. Japan needs something for reasons of its own, but
                            they need something from Japan for reasons of their own. If approached
                            in that way he felt that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> would
                            respect Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed with the President. The central feature of the
                            present policy of the Government of Japan is to open relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. But Japan wished to do this on
                            a basis of mutuality.</p>
                        <p>The President added that this should not be done at the expense of
                            Japan’s friends, just as the United States guarded against sacrificing
                            its friends.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned that the
                            press should be told only that the President and the Prime Minister
                            discussed this subject in a general way, without describing the specific
                            substance.</p>
                        <p><pb n="483" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_483"/>The President felt that it would
                            be useful with the press to say, if asked, that China was discussed,
                            (because they would say we are lying if we said it was not) and secondly
                            that every country seeks to develop its own relations on the basis of
                            its own national self-interest.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that it
                            would be a wiser approach to the press to say “on the basis of its own
                            necessities.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he wished to emphasize with respect to China
                            that he is not seeking to normalize relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> on “rails they laid down,” that is,
                            that Japan would not accept all of Peking’s demands. As a basic premise,
                            Japan would do nothing to normalize relations which would adversely
                            affect Japan’s position in the free world, or Japan-U.S. relations, or
                            which could not be defended as being in Japan’s own national interest.
                            Therefore, he promised he would inform the United States of all
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President commented on one point that we found, which is that the
                            Chinese leaders are wise and hard-bargainers, and that it is our
                            impression that they keep a bargain they agree to. Another point
                            important to note is that they take a long-term view, and do not allow
                            any possible short-term advantage to deter them from looking down the
                            road for long-term advantage.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan hopes to understand China to some
                            extent, even though it has had many conflicts with China over this past
                            100 years. While the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> may have
                            desired relations with Japan, Japan has not had relations with them for
                            one-quarter of a century, but Japan is now convinced that normalization,
                            rather than containment, would best serve the interest of peace and
                            stability in Asia. In the absence of normalizations Peking could
                            continue to interfere in Japan’s domestic affairs, but if relations are
                            to be normalized Japan could insist on non interference in domestic
                            affairs as a condition.</p>
                        <p>The President wryly commented “and hope for the best.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister reemphasized that the premise on which he approached
                            normalization is that he would not lose sight of Japan’s relations with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>(Here the President checked his watch.)</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister conceded that Taiwan is a difficult issue, and that
                            Japan would perhaps seek American help in handling it.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that this could be discussed tomorrow, along with
                            the other subjects of interest we had not yet discussed, Korea, and our
                            negotiation position with respect to Vietnam, as well as any other
                            subjects the Prime Minister wished to raise.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister wished to speak one word about the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>, which is Japan’s “lifeline” in
                            security. He said that Japan would continue to do its best to assist the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> economy, but added that the <pb
                                n="484" facs="0515" xml:id="pg_484"/><gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> has asked that he convey their desire to the President
                            that the United States not withdraw its forces from Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we will not, but pointed out that we could not
                            stay there if the use of our bases in Japan is restricted.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said there would be no such restrictions on United
                            States bases in Japan under the Security Treaty. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that this included the
                            right to move tanks on public streets.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he hoped to resolve this matter in the near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned, with the President saying that he looked forward
                            to further talks at dinner this evening.</p>

                                >Rogers</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>
                            meeting. Acting on the President’s suggestion, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> reported that he and Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> had had a useful
                            and business-like exchange on a number of problems of mutual interest,
                            primarily those dealing with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>,
                            Taiwan, and Korea. They had been on the point of beginning a discussion
                            of the economic matters when the Prime Minister and the President joined
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it had been gratifying to hear the Foreign Minister
                            say that Japan was proceeding with its plans for normalization of
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> with
                            considerable care and thought to ensure that nothing would impair the
                            Security Treaty between the U.S. and Japan, and that even though Japan
                            establishes diplomatic relations with Peking, it would hope to maintain
                            good contacts with Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he had stressed that in our desire to improve our
                            relationship with Peking, the President had emphasized in all possible
                            ways that this would not be done at the expense of friends and allies,
                            that in the process we intend to preserve our diplomatic relations with
                            Taiwan and our security arrangements, and that we have assured the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> that nothing we do with Peking
                            will be at their expense. The Secretary said that in this context he had
                            also discussed the <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss>’s membership in
                            the IFI, the Korean question in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            this fall, and Cambodian membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary continued that the Foreign Minister had given a full and frank
                            explanation of Japan’s intentions in normalizing relations with Peking.
                            On this point, the Secretary had emphasized that we are not giving any
                            advice to Japan, and that it is very important that Japan understand
                            that the decision is Japan’s to make and that we are in no position to
                            approve or disapprove. He had said that in a multipolar world, each
                            nation must follow its own interests but that through conversations such
                            as these we can cooperate with one another.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Secretary said he had had an opportunity to refer to the
                            Foreign Minister’s very thoughtful speech to the Japan-America Society,
                            which emphasizes the fact that we really don’t have any foreign policy
                            differences; we have unanimity and this should emerge even though our
                            two nations are moving in new directions which serve their individual
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> expressed
                            appreciation to the President and the Prime Minister for joining this
                            meeting. He said he had explained <pb n="486" facs="0517"
                                xml:id="pg_486"/>to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> that the new <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> Government had judged that the time was ripe to
                            begin to move toward normalization of relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and that he had given the Secretary
                            background for this decision. He had explained that the basic policy of
                            the Tanaka Government in approaching the question of normalization of
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> was that the
                            basic relationship of friendship with the United States, symbolized by
                            the mutual Security Treaty, should not be harmed. This was Japan’s
                            determination.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued that of course there were differences in
                            the policy of the two countries toward the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>. The United States is trying to improve relations with
                            Peking and Japan wants to normalize them. Therefore, our approaches may
                            be different, but even so we must approach this difficult problem
                            without harming our relations with the U.S. The route to Peking that now
                            appears to be open wide may prove to be very narrow in the end, but it
                            seems now worth at least a try. Judging from recent <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> actions, an agreement with Peking may
                            not be impossible. He was happy to confirm that the two governments
                            share the same targets and that as we seek to improve or normalize
                            relations with the Chinese we must keep in constant touch to insure
                            mutual cooperation and understanding of each others views.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> had
                            explained, the President and the Prime Minister had joined them just as
                            he was about to say that under the strong leadership of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> it is Japan’s policy
                            to seek to narrow the imbalance in our bilateral trade to an acceptable
                            level in as short a time as feasible, and that the Tanaka Government was
                            about to arrange its domestic economic policy to bring about an increase
                            in imports to this end.</p>
                        <p>The President reported that his talk with the Prime Minister had been in
                            the same vein. He thought that the key point emphasized by both the
                            Secretary and the Foreign Minister was that while any great power
                            naturally must develop policies to serve its own interests, the
                            interests of Japan and the United States are best served by policies
                            which do not place us in conflict, economically or politically. In his
                            talks in Peking earlier this year and in Moscow, he had always kept
                            foremost in his mind the necessity to enter into no understanding which
                            would in any way be to the detriment of the U.S.-Japan relationship.
                            This does not mean that the policies of two major nations such as ours
                            will always be identical; there may be differences in tactics and
                            timing, whether economic or political. We must avoid embarking on any
                            collision courses and we can do so through meetings like this, which he
                            and the Prime Minister had agreed must take place as often as possible,
                            at high levels and at other levels as well.</p>
                        <p>Putting it directly, the President continued, we have sought better
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> because we think
                            it in the interest of the United <pb n="487" facs="0518" xml:id="pg_487"
                            />States, the Pacific countries, and the world to do so, and the same is
                            true regarding the Soviet Union. But, in pursuing these goals, the
                            President emphasized, we do not wish to let anything harm the U.S.-Japan
                            relationship. This is the cornerstone of our U.S.-Japan policy.</p>
                        <p>He had also discussed with the Prime Minister Japan’s role, not only in
                            the Pacific but also in the world.</p>
                        <p>Putting the relationship with Japan in the context of overall U.S.
                            policy, the President said that in his view our policy has sometimes
                            suffered in the past from being either too much Europe first or too much
                            Pacific first. Our interests are best served by policies which show
                            equal emphasis on Europe and the Pacific—in other words a total policy
                            rather than one which tilts too far in one direction. In some quarters
                            in the United States there is a tendency to consider Japan exclusively
                            as an Asian power; however, as is the case with the United States,
                            because of its enormous economic strength Japan is inevitably a world
                            power.</p>
                        <p>The President then described the tremendous change in Japan’s world
                            position that had taken place since his first visit in 1953. Then, what
                            the U.S., <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and Europe did was all that
                            mattered in terms of promoting economic stability in the world. But now
                            Japan has a gross national product greater than any European country and
                            Japan, from an economic standpoint, does not look inside but outside to
                            Latin America, Africa and Europe. In this situation it is essential for
                            any free world economic policy to succeed that Japan play an equal role
                            with the U.S. and the new <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss>. In
                            another context, that is why we support Japan’s desire to be a permanent
                            member of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council and
                            why, when we schedule meetings with other major Allied nations, we
                            consider it vitally important to have the same intimate consultations
                            with Japan.</p>
                        <p>We in the United States recognize that the economic futures of our two
                            countries are tied together, not only in the Pacific but in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> said he had
                            extracted ten points from his notes on his meeting with the President.
                            These were:</p>
                        <p>1. The close U.S.-Japan relationship of friendship must be strengthened
                            and deepened.</p>
                        <p>2. Japan deeply appreciates the fact that over the past quarter century,
                            cooperation from the United States had enabled the Japanese economy to
                            grow and become strong.</p>
                        <p>3. For the maintenance of world peace and the expansion of the world
                            economy, it is essential that the U.S. economy continue to expand and
                            that the value of the dollar be stabilized. This is in Japan’s interest
                            and Japan wishes to cooperate in promoting it.</p>
                        <p><pb n="488" facs="0519" xml:id="pg_488"/>4. In regard to our bilateral
                            trade imbalance, Japan will do its best to attain a better balance
                            because over the long term good relations cannot be maintained if trade
                            were to remain so out of balance.</p>
                        <p>5. For the development of normal trade between the U.S. and Japan, it is
                            imperative that the two nations keep in constant touch so that their
                            mutual efforts can profit on the basis of better understanding.</p>
                        <p>6. Japan fully appreciates the fact that the U.S. has expended great
                            effort to maintain peace in the world. In the economic area, Japan
                            wishes to assist the U.S. to maintain world peace and on a basis of
                            cooperation with the U.S. Japan would like to participate in an effort
                            with the enlarged <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> so as to seek a
                            better world development on an enlarged basis.</p>
                        <p>7. Japan wishes to expand its economic aid to Southeast Asia and the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>, and in the post Vietnam period
                            Japan would wish to contribute a sizeable effort to promote continuing
                            economic recovery and welfare programs in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>8. On Japan’s relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>,
                            the Prime Minister endorses what the Foreign Minister had said.</p>
                        <p>9. Even if the world changes, U.S.-Japan relations will not change.</p>
                        <p>10. It is imperative for U.S. and Japan to be able to communicate with
                            each other. The Prime Minister therefore appreciates the President’s
                            effort in bringing about this meeting and would wish to call on him in
                            Washington after his re-election in November to congratulate him. He
                            looks forward to hearing the President’s views at that time.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked the President for dinner last night, and
                            following an animated exchange of further amenities the President turned
                            to the subject of Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that the United States and Japan have an identical
                            interest here in supporting a strong <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss>, independent and free of foreign domination, which is
                            indispensible to our defense commitment to Japan. Noting pressures to
                            reduce our troop presence in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>,
                            he said that he is doing all he can to resist them. One obvious strong
                            argument to be made is the need to maintain <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> independence. But in addition, the security of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> is essential to the maintenance
                            of the security of Japan. He said that we are watching with interest the
                            current meetings between North and South Korea which could reduce
                            tensions somewhat, but in our view he did not think we should read too
                            much significance into them. We should not allow preliminary talks in
                            areas other than security to [<hi rend="italic">lead</hi>?] to a
                            lowering of our defense capability. Perhaps the situation is similar to
                            that of Germany, where West and East Germany are beginning to talk about
                            humanitarian matters and personal contacts. However, this should not
                            allow any reduction in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> strength,
                            which can only be achieved on the basis of mutual reductions by both
                            sides. Our position, he explained, is to welcome the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> talks with North Korea, but it would
                            be premature for us to talk to North Korea. Our intention, he said, is
                            to maintain our present troop level in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> at the present time, until there are definite changes
                            in the security side.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt that this reflected a correct understanding of
                            both Koreas. He did not believe that the development of talks between
                            North and South Korea would reduce tensions as much as anticipated.
                            Based on long association with Koreans, he felt that North Korea has its
                            own purpose in talking to the South. Japan also is watching developments
                            carefully in terms of working out its own contacts with North Korea
                            gradually, in humanitarian and academic exchanges.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister believed it important that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> develop its rural agricultural areas
                            before allowing full exchanges with the North, because these are
                            comparatively less developed, and the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> must eliminate possible dissatisfaction among its farm
                            population. Therefore Japan intended to provide aid to develop
                            agriculture and fisheries in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>,
                            to insure a higher standard of living in the South than the North. Also,
                            he said, Japan is discussing with the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> the construction <pb n="490" facs="0521"
                                xml:id="pg_490"/>of a steel mill, which would give the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> a greater steel capacity than North
                            Korea. Japan’s primary intention is to cooperate to create a situation
                            in which disaffected South Korean elements are not tempted to serve
                            North Korean interests. Japan would soon send a six minister delegation
                            to Seoul, headed by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Ohira</persName>, to take part in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss>-Japan Ministerial conference beginning September 4.
                            Japan, he summarized would do its best to assist <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> economic development, but he asked
                            that the United States not withdraw any of its forces from the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President wished to say in a general sense that what the Prime
                            Minister said, that is knowing the Koreans well through long
                            association, is also true of a number of other areas in Asia, where
                            Japan is more expert than the United States. In the new era now
                            developing, to which the Prime Minister referred before it is important
                            that we make a mutual effort. We would do the best we could, because of
                            our big presence, but he suggested that the Prime Minister, the Foreign
                            Minister or any of their colleagues have ideas for a different approach
                            about the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> should feel free to raise
                            it privately. Candidly speaking we do not know everything, and we do
                            respect Japan’s knowledge in this area, and he said that the United
                            States did need advice. Continuing, the President said that the question
                            really is one of the future of free Asia. In this connection, what he
                            wished to see develop is not just a United States policy, but a
                            U.S.-Japan policy for Asia, because both countries are the two strongest
                            economic powers. He said that he is confident that we can work together
                            with Japan as a full partner, not a junior partner but continued that we
                            should also respect the sensitivities of the smaller nations, lest their
                            resentment be provoked.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that basically Japan and the United States share
                            common goals. Japan does understand the situation in the Asian nations
                            well, and Japan wished to do its share wherever it would be logical and
                            effective for Japan to do the talking.</p>
                        <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> returned to the
                            room.) The President reviewed for him that he had told the Prime
                            Minister that what we want is not just an American approach in Asia, but
                            a mutual partnership between the United States and Japan. He noted the
                            sensitivity of the small nations, and observed that the new element is
                            Japan assuming a full partnership.</p>
                        <p>The President then continued, saying that it takes time to formalize
                            approaches in this kind of matter, but that he is suggesting discussion,
                            and the desirability of contacts with respect to ideas, on a
                            confidential basis if that is desirable. For example, in another area,
                            he recalled Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>
                            telling him in returning from a visit to Iran of a proposal being
                            discussed in a preliminary stage for Japanese-Iranian cooperation to
                            develop oil resources, which would require American cooperation as well.
                            He said that we would welcome any proposal to <pb n="491" facs="0522"
                                xml:id="pg_491"/>cooperate with Japan. There will be cases that the
                            United States and Japan each would wish to operate independently, he
                            noted, but there also would be cases when both would wish to work
                            together with a third country. Primarily our discussions have related to
                            US-Japan relations, and Asia, but he pointed out that Japan is a great
                            economic power, heavily dependent on Middle-Eastern oil, just as the
                            European nations. Therefore, he felt it would be helpful if there is
                            anything Japan or the United States can do to see that strong, friendly
                            countries like Iran survive, and are not overrun, but remain friendly to
                            our interests. Japan, therefore, of necessity finds itself playing the
                            role of a global power. For our part, he assured the Prime Minister,
                            that through Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> we
                            would inform him of any developments in the Middle East which would
                            affect their interests. Should radical governments, like those in Libya
                            and Iraq, gain control of the Middle East they would hold up the price
                            of oil, and choke off Japan’s oil life line. Therefore, it is in our
                            interest to support friendly governments, like those in Iran and Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> referred to another
                            area which he has already discussed with the Prime Minister on two
                            occasions, the development of Siberia, for which he understood there is
                            an actual proposal in which preliminary steps are being taken to
                            establish a mechanism to do so.</p>
                        <p>The President wished to inform the Prime Minister in confidence that he
                            has asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to go to
                            Moscow September 11–13, with the purpose of following up on the Moscow
                            summit, and to discuss matters of mutual interest. On his return, he
                            would see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> and
                            report to him in confidence any matters of interest.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked him for this offer.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned that this
                            visit would not be announced until September 6, Japan time.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> are extremely sensitive about
                            keeping such arrangements secret until announced, although we do inform
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and Japan, confidentially.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that the trip
                            is scheduled to be announced at noon, September 5, Washington time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that exchanges of information between Japan and
                            the United States with respect to the Middle East, <gloss
                                target="#t_SEA_1">SEA</gloss> and Siberia are desirable, and that he
                            would cooperate in maintaining the close contact the President
                            mentioned. Not only in economics, but also in the political field he
                            felt that our ultimate objectives are identical, for which reason Japan
                            wished to share the burden in those areas where it could. As one
                            example, he cited Indochina in the post-Vietnam period, for which Japan
                            is planning to cooperate in stabilizing living conditions and economic
                            reconstruction.</p>
                        <p><pb n="492" facs="0523" xml:id="pg_492"/>The Prime Minister also took
                            Taiwan as an example. Should Japan be able to open diplomatic relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> Taiwan of course would
                            become a problem, but Japan desired to continue to maintain its economic
                            exchanges with Taiwan to the maximum extent possible. He could foresee
                            many difficulties, however, for it is conceivable that Japan would
                            terminate its official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Therefore he
                            hoped, and would be pleased if the United States could extend its good
                            offices to Japan vis-à-vis Taiwan. He added that Japan intended to
                            maintain its economic relations with Taiwan as of the present. For
                            example Japan wished to guarantee the rights of the people of Taiwan who
                            are in Japan and their economic interests, but as is evident in the
                            cases of Canada, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, and France, all
                            of whom have formal diplomatic relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, neither could Japan have diplomatic
                            relations with Taiwan and would have to withdraw its Embassy. This is an
                            unavoidable development with which Japan would have to come to grips. In
                            its heart Japan wished to remain friends with Taiwan, but as a matter of
                            reality there would be no other course. As a real problem Japan’s
                            relations with Taiwan could become triangular, with the United States at
                            the apex. Japan thus would be “saved” by the fact that the United States
                            maintains its relations with Taiwan. Therefore he hoped for United
                            States assistance, in the interest of peace in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>The President cautioned that the problem there is that three could play,
                            not just us, but also Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he is confident that Taiwan will “play.”</p>
                        <p>The President said that it is in Taiwan’s interest to survive as a viable
                            economic entity. To the extent that continued economic relations with
                            Japan serve this interest perhaps Taiwan would look with favor upon such
                            an arrangement. However, he said that he would be less than candid if he
                            did not mention that our exchange with the Taiwan Government showed that
                            they are watching the Prime Minister’s visit to Peking closely to see
                            what happens.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he understood.</p>
                        <p>The President added that <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> is a very proud man, who has spent his entire
                            life fighting for his beliefs; being advanced in age it would be
                            difficult to predict his reaction. We are doing all we can to preserve
                            Taiwan’s seat in international financial organs. There is a fine line,
                            he warned, between what can be done to have full diplomatic relations
                            with Peking and continue to have economic relations with Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister understood. Unlike East and West Germany, and North
                            and South Korea, however, both Peking and Taiwan claim to be the sole
                            legitimate government of China. He explained that Japan, <pb n="493"
                                facs="0524" xml:id="pg_493"/>in unofficial discussions with Taiwan,
                            has pointed out that it has no other choice as long as Taiwan insists on
                            an either-or type choice. When asked for Taiwan’s feelings about
                            becoming a separate country, they say this gets into the 2-China theory
                            and that while they understand Japan’s question they can’t reply with a
                            definitive position. He said that he knows that Generalissimo <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> is a very proud and
                            great leader, as well as his deputy <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1"
                                >Chiang</persName> Ching-kuo. They have a deep understanding of
                            reality, but will not respond on the point relating to 2 Chinas. He
                            agreed that we would have to wait and see, as the President said, what
                            the conditions are to be discussed in Peking. It will also be crucial
                            afterward, he added, for Japan to have the good offices of the United
                            States vis-à-vis Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that we have found one thing in our discussions
                            with our friend <persName corresp="#p_CKJ_1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                            and with <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName>, that is
                            that while they disagree on many points they agree on one point, that
                            there is only one China.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that this poses the most difficult problem.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said that he would be pleased to hear whatever
                            the President wished to say about Vietnam and his visit to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Before the President could begin speaking about Vietnam, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> insisted there be no press
                            briefing by the Japanese of anything the President might say about
                            Vietnam. The morning papers here are reporting stories from Tokyo that
                            the President had indicated to the Prime Minister that a peaceful
                            settlement would be reached during 1972. This is not true, and the
                            President said no such thing.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would keep everything in strict
                            confidence, and stated that neither he nor Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> had talked to the press. He
                            pointed out that the Japanese press engages in “creative writing.” He
                            understood how a leak could create an obstacle in the negotiations, and
                            promised to keep secret whatever he heard. However, if there is any
                            risk, he said, he could do without anything on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President assumed that the Prime Minister has followed the public
                            reports that we have had a number of meetings in Paris, and that Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has been meeting
                            the North Vietnamese privately. Both sides have agreed to say nothing
                            about the substance of these talks. He then explained that in his
                            speeches of January 25 and May 8 we have put forward a complete proposal
                            for peace, offering a ceasefire, total withdrawal of our forces, an
                            internationally supervised election and a return of all POWs by both
                            sides. However, the one sticking point (well publicized) is the North
                            Vietnamese insistence on the condition for a settlement that we join
                            them in overthrowing our ally, the Government in Saigon. Much as we wish
                            to end the war, we will not <pb n="494" facs="0525" xml:id="pg_494"/>do
                            so. This would be morally wrong for the 17 million people of South
                            Vietnam, many of whom would then be slaughtered. However, more
                            importantly, if the United States overthrew its ally in South Vietnam,
                            when the military situation did not even require such extreme action,
                            this would mean that all our friends and allies throughout the world
                            could no longer depend on the United States word. If our word is not
                            good in one place it is not good anywhere, in Japan or Europe or
                            elsewhere. We are willing to go an extra mile in trying to arrange a
                            settlement with North Vietnam, but are not going to sacrifice our ally
                            and overthrow the Government of Saigon to help install a communist
                            government. The fundamental keystone of our foreign policy is that we
                            will not desert an ally; Japan, <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>,
                            Europe, Israel, all can rely on that. Once we break our word and desert
                            our ally, difficult as the war may be, no one would rely on our
                            word.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that in our discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName>, and with Brezhnev and his
                            colleagues we made it clear unequivocally that we desire better
                            relations with these governments but would make no secret, or public
                            deals to do so at the expense of our friends and allies. They do not
                            agree with us but he said if we were to say that we would throw over an
                            old friend to become friends with you they would have no respect for us.
                            Our new friends would have no confidence in us if we were to break our
                            word to an old friend. On their side too, he observed, they stand by
                            their friends, and respect us for doing so too.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Soviets, the President said that his visit was
                            constructive in developing new areas of cooperation in space and health
                            on the side of peaceful activities, and on the side of arms in beginning
                            to limit arms.</p>
                        <p>The President noted an interesting point, as the Prime Minister knows,
                            that the Soviets and <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> agree on
                            nothing these days, but our discussions with both disclosed that they
                            agree on one point, they have a healthy respect for Japan, whose
                            economic might has impressed them. Also, they both need Japanese
                            investment and know-how. Thus Japan’s position is not weak. He said
                            Japan has something they want, which makes Japan’s position strong in
                            talking to Brezhnev and <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>,
                            and to <persName corresp="#p_CE_1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(The President reviewed these last few remarks for Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, who returned after another
                            brief absence.)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> affirmed this
                            estimate, noting that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is
                            interested in securing Japanese investment to develop Siberia. China
                            also has great respect for Japan, and has a high estimate of the ability
                            of the Japanese to achieve a dominant position in a number of regions in
                            Asia. He felt that this respect has motivated the rapidity of the tempo
                            of China’s decision to talk to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President said that neither the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> say so, but
                            both are aware that in today’s world it is impossible to be a major
                            military <pb n="495" facs="0526" xml:id="pg_495"/>power without a strong
                            economic base. He understands that Japan has no idea of doing more in
                            the military field, except in the area of self defense, but Japan has
                            this great economic power, which has gained it great respect from every
                            country, and has the potential to become powerful in other respects as
                            well. It is good that Japan is strong. However, the more Japan protests
                            it does not intend to become a military power the more they do not
                            believe Japan. This, he felt, is good.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan’s constitution explicitly forbids the
                            use of force to resolve an international dispute. Nor does Japan intend
                            to rearm, or become a military power. A ⅔ majority in both the upper and
                            lower houses of the Diet is required to amend the constitution. He
                            expressed wry appreciation that the United States had drafted such an
                            excellent constitution for Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then asked one question, whether the United States
                            intended to seek full diplomatic relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, or would continue along the line of
                            the Shanghai Communiqué.</p>
                        <p>The President replied “the latter”, because the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> will not have relations with any nation which has
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>, and we are
                            supporting the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>. However we would
                            explore by all means how to have healthy relations without formal
                            diplomatic relations. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> has been to Peking and we have found a channel
                            in Paris. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> could go
                            to Paris again to keep open that channel.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the importance of non-interference in domestic
                            affairs, with the possibility of a diplomatic mission from the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the point was raised when <persName

                                    >Tanaka</persName> is apparently referring to a visit by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Andrei Gromyko</persName> to Japan,

                                with a briefing on this visit. (Memorandum of conversation, February

                            which time it was agreed that Japan would open peace negotiation with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> this fall, perhaps at the
                            highest level. One condition Japan intended to insist on for a peace
                            treaty is the return of the four northern islands, the Habomais and
                            Shikotan, and Etorofu and Kunashiri.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would be
                            as generous as we were in returning Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister appreciated that American gesture, and could now tell
                            the Soviets that the United States returned Okinawa out of friendship
                            and that Japan hoped the Russians would do the same with the northern
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>The President was sure that would be an interesting conversation.</p>
                        <p><pb n="496" facs="0527" xml:id="pg_496"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted that if Japan got back territory from
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> then others would also demand
                            that territory be returned, especially the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>’s Eastern European allies. Of course, Japan is free to
                            make demands, but the Europeans have all concluded peace treaties.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he could not get popular support for a peace
                            treaty without the return of these islands, which conditions is
                            non-negotiable.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained, in response to the President’s question,
                            that the Soviets expelled all Japanese from the islands when they
                            occupied them after the end of the war. Before the war the population
                            was about 10 to 20 thousand.</p>

                        <p>The President said that he believed it useful for the Secretary of State
                            and the Foreign Minister to join this discussion, but did not believe it
                            necessary to review his own earlier discussions with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> or those of the
                            Secretary of State, Foreign Minister and others in the other meeting,
                            since he assumed both covered the same ground. Probably all that
                            remained for discussion was the Joint Statement and the economic
                            package.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted agreement on the Joint Statement and the other
                            statement, both of which had already been released to the press, subject
                            to embargo until 11:00 a.m. Agreement had been reached, he explained,
                            with no serious difficulties, and the statements are satisfactory to us.
                            He wished to congratulate those who had worked to produce them for their
                                labors.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">The “Text of the Joint

                        <p>The President said that one constructive result of this conference we
                            should be sure to understand is that it provides for a continuous belt
                            of communications, not just meetings, for example, of the Joint Cabinet
                            Committee on trade and economic affairs but also at the highest level,
                            not just to discuss problems which have arisen, but regular continuing
                            consultations for foreseeable problems and consult on means to resolve
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that these talks have been most significant in
                            that both sides agreed on the desirability of having frequent,
                            continuing discussions, liaison and consultations about various matters
                            (hopefully not negotiations) before they emerged as full-scale problems.
                            With respect to the annual Cabinet Committee meeting, he realized that
                            one could not be held this Presidential election year, and said that
                            Japan would be pleased to take its turn to host the meeting early next
                            year, to discuss everything, including this year’s portion as well, at
                            the highest level. He said that he looked forward to frequent meetings,
                            as often as possible, not just once a year. He hoped that there could be
                            prior consultation and cooperation on such matters as the President had
                            indicated, including investment and economic cooperation in Asia, the
                            Middle East and Siberia. With respect to economic problems, he said that
                            he personally views Japan-U.S. economic relations as being of paramount
                            importance, and, as he told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> recently, he believes that these problems can
                            be solved through experts meeting, every month if necessary (not
                            negotiations), to study up-to-date statistics and through constant and
                            adequate liaison. The President said that <pb n="498" facs="0529"
                                xml:id="pg_498"/>he had expressed the hope that both sides could
                            explore the possibility of joint enterprises, and that U.S.-Japan
                            cooperation in such areas as Siberia and Iran for example would be good
                            for both countries, politically as well as economically. (The Prime
                            Minister interjected Latin America as another area of cooperation.) In
                            some cases, the President continued, one side or the other might take
                            the lead but such cooperation would be good for both.</p>
                        <p>Being practical and candid, the President explained, he said there would
                            also be occasions when a Japanese economic enterprise would wish to have
                            an operation with a third country independently, just as American
                            investors would wish to do so independently, but on other occasions both
                            could cooperate in their mutual interest. He cited U.S.-Japan
                            contributions to international development organs such as the <gloss
                                target="#t_ADB_1">ADB</gloss>, where however indirectly, both
                            countries are working together. However, he cited the exciting new
                            prospect that the United States and Japan, the two most prosperous
                            countries in the free world might work together in other areas. Although
                            he had no examples in mind, he said that he would welcome any
                            suggestions Japan might have to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would be pleased if he could cooperate.
                            For example, such areas as he wished to discuss included the development
                            of Tyumen petroleum resources and Siberia, another is the Senkaku
                            Islands petroleum resources, and the fields off-shore from Korea. Japan,
                            he said, should not do this alone, but should consult fully with the
                            United States, Iran is another such area, he added.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, on a related subject, that he would not wish to end
                            the meeting without expressing our satisfaction with Japan’s cooperation
                            in space development, with which our space people are pleased.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed pleasure with other cooperation over a
                            broad range, including culture, education, exchanges of persons and
                            pollution control. This kind of exchange, he felt, could be developed
                            further.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary assumed that the President and the Prime Minister had
                            covered the same ground, but explained that the Foreign Minister had
                            been explaining Japan’s views about the forthcoming talks with Peking
                            just when the President invited them both to join his meeting. If the
                            President wished, he felt that it would be useful for the Foreign
                            Minister to review here his predictions about what might develop.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that it would be useful to hear the Foreign
                            Minister’s analysis.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister explained that the date for Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s visit has not yet been
                            finalized, but when decided could <pb n="499" facs="0530"
                                xml:id="pg_499"/>probably be the last part of September or the first
                            part of October. His principal work when he went to Peking would be to
                            discuss the fundamental problems involved in establishing diplomatic
                            relations between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.
                            Should agreement be reached there could be an immediate opening of
                            formal diplomatic relations. Having renounced all claim to Taiwan in the
                            Peace Treaty of San Francisco, Japan, in the strictest sense, has no
                            conditions, and cannot determine by itself that the territorial title to
                            Taiwan is vested with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.
                            Therefore, he expected that if Japan is to have diplomatic relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> these would be based on a
                            joint communiqué. If relations are thus established a treaty of peace
                            and friendship, and a treaty of <gloss target="#t_FCN_1">FCN</gloss>, as
                            well as agreements on civil aviation, fisheries and the like could be
                            negotiated subsequently.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated his analysis that Peking has shown no
                            reactions differing decisively from Japan’s views. He anticipated that
                            diplomatic relations could be established while Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> is in Peking.</p>
                        <p>However, the Foreign Minister explained, the Prime Minister’s great
                            concern is how to deal with the Taiwan question. Japan would shift its
                            diplomatic representation from Taipei to Peking, but to the extent
                            possible wish to make its greatest effort to continue to provide for
                            personal travel between Taiwan and Japan, for trade and investments, and
                            to continue measures for tariff preferences for Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the formula Japan plans to use is interesting.
                            Canada and Italy “took note” of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            position on Taiwan, and in our own Shanghai Communiqué we used different
                            language, that is, that the people on both sides claim there is only one
                            China, and that we did not challenge this view. Japan, he noted, seems
                            to favor the Netherlands formulation.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister explained that Japan has relinquished all claims to
                            Taiwan in the Peace Treaty. The question of the title of Taiwan,
                            therefore, is in the hands of the allied powers who signed the Treaty of
                            San Francisco, he said, but the allied powers have given no indication
                            with respect to the title of Taiwan. Japan is not in any position to say
                            that Taiwan belongs to the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.
                            Therefore, Japan can say no more than “it understands and respects” the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> view that Taiwan is an integral
                            part of China. He recalled that the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            “acknowledged” Peking’s claim, the Canadians “took note” and the United
                            States “did not challenge,” all of which formulations differ in nuance,
                            but the Netherlands has gone farther than anyone else. Therefore, he
                            felt that Japan would have to go at least as far as the Netherlands, but
                            said that Japan would not go beyond “that fence.”<note n="3"

                        <p><pb n="500" facs="0531" xml:id="pg_500"/>The President offered one word
                            of advice to the Prime Minister before his visit to Peking—get lots of
                            sleep because the Chinese stay up all night to work on the Communiqué.
                            They feel language is very important, therefore, he advised the Japanese
                            to be prepared to stay up all night.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the Americans are more fortunate in working
                            out a Joint Communiqué in English and Chinese, aided by the different
                            nuances between Chinese and English, but since Japanese and Chinese are
                            both written in the same characters the problem of nuance is more
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>The President assumed that he meant that the English and Chinese texts
                            are each subject to their own interpretation, but that this is not
                            possible because Japanese and Chinese are written in the same
                            script.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would not talk all night.</p>
                        <p>The President, in all fairness to the Chinese, said that they are
                            meticulous in their use of words. Subsequent analysis of both texts of
                            the Shanghai Communiqué at the State Department revealed that in the
                            Chinese text wherever a word was subject to ambiguous translation, the
                            Chinese invariably chose the nuance more favorable to the United States
                            side rather than their own.</p>
                        <p>The President also pointed out that the Chinese bargain very hard but are
                            meticulously scrupulous about honoring agreements when reached; the
                            reason for the meticulous use of language by the Chinese is that they
                            wish to have no misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            Foreign Minister said that the American interpreters were good, but
                            unfortunately all spoke prerevolutionary Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister could
                            read Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Neither could, they said, but the Foreign Minister said that he reads
                            English.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that the Foreign Minister addressed the
                            Japan-American Society in Tokyo recently in English.</p>
                        <p>To conclude the talks with a light touch before the photographers
                            entered, the President allowed that the interpreters for these talks
                            were adequate enough, but could not really compare with the Chinese
                            interpreters—all of whom are pretty girls.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> about the results
                            of his recent trip to Moscow—in particular what had been said on Far
                            Eastern problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said that the Asian situation had not been discussed in any depth. The
                            Soviets asked about what had transpired at the President and Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s Hawaii meeting.
                            He noted that the Soviets are obviously concerned about Japan’s
                            normalization of relations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss>. Responding to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s mention of recent reports that the Soviets were
                            deploying additional ground forces to the Chinese border, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said there probably is some
                            truth to these reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that his
                            talks in Moscow centered on the prospects for U.S.-Soviet agreement on
                            trade and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. He quipped that the
                            United States seemed to be able to settle its trade problems with
                            everyone except Japan. Answering Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s question as to whether trade, lend lease, and
                            related issues in U.S.-Soviet relations would be settled as a package,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said they would.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked if the
                            U.S. had planned to extend long-term government credit to the Soviet
                            Union, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            replied that we would, although starting at a low level.</p>

                            reference to the President’s mention at Hawaii of Joint U.S.-Japanese
                            participation in the economic development of Siberia,<note n="2"

                                discussed Japan-U.S. economic cooperation in Siberia during his

                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that the United States
                            is prepared to discuss this further with Japan, and noted that he
                            thought <pb n="502" facs="0533" xml:id="pg_502"/>a Japanese government
                            representative was scheduled to visit Washington shortly to discuss this
                            and other economic problems. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName> said that an unofficial representative, Mr. Anzai
                            (Board Chairman of the Tokyo Gas Company), is already here. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said the Japanese
                            government wants most of the money involved to be put up by private
                            capital. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that
                            the U.S. was fully in agreement with this approach, and suggested that
                            Mr. Anzai talk to Commerce Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1"
                                >Peterson</persName>, noting that the White House would encourage
                            movement in this direction.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked when Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> expected that the
                            U.S. would reach agreement with the Soviet Union on trade and related
                            questions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said
                            that on trade, agreement would probably be achieved within a month. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that he had
                            learned from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"
                                >Tanaka</persName> that doing it fast was the most effective
                            approach. Replying to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1"
                                >Ushiba</persName>’s question as to whether the Administration would
                            have a problem with Congress over most favored nation treatment of the
                            Soviet Union, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said
                            he did not think so. He added, however, that the Administration would
                            wait until after the election to submit legislation to Congress on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked about the
                            opposition’s charge that the Administration does not apply sufficient
                            pressure to the Soviets on the question of the Jewish exit tax. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            opposition thinks this tactic will rally the Jewish vote to it. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG_1">McGovern</persName> is now in fact
                            accusing the Administration of not being tough enough on the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked when Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> thought the U.S.
                            would reach agreement with the Soviet Union to resume discussions on
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that this would
                            probably come about yet this year, noting that the negotiations on this
                            would be difficult. He explained that the problem involves two possible
                            approaches—qualitative versus quantative limits. Qualitative limits are
                            much more difficult. The first month of the negotiations will be
                            confined to a discussion of principles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> agreed with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> that manifold technical problems
                            are also involved. He related he had taken the opportunity of the
                            President’s Moscow visit to discuss this problem with the Soviet Defense
                            Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Their initial reaction was that they
                            were enraged because a foreigner knew as much of the characteristics of
                            their weapons as he did, but later settled down to a more rational
                            discussion of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked what the
                            situation was on the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that in the
                            course of his most recent visit to Moscow the Soviets had, in a
                            diplomatic note, agreed to hold separately the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> and a conference <pb n="503" facs="0534"
                                xml:id="pg_503"/>on the <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>, at
                            the same time that these problems would be considered in the same
                            general framework. The Soviets thus are ready to link the two. The
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> will open in November and the
                            meeting on <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> next January.
                            Responding to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>’s
                            reference to a rumor that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> wants
                            to send an observer, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said he had heard this as a joke—along with
                            the story that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> wants to join
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> knew who had given him
                            the Japanese doll that he had brought back from the June trip to Tokyo.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said that he
                            did not know but that he would find out.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> had any additional
                            news on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s
                            upcoming Peking visit.<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3"><persName

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>, after
                            reviewing the dates and the contents of the joint statement released
                            September 20, explained that the Prime Minister’s visit would not
                            necessarily result in diplomatic relations between Japan and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> at this point. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> said he was not sure that Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> planned to go
                            all-out for diplomatic relations now. The principle constraint is the
                            strong Taiwan lobby in Japan, particularly in the Liberal Democratic
                            Party, as well as the tough <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss>
                            reaction. At the same time, approximately 70 percent of Japanese public
                            opinion favors immediate diplomatic relations with Peking. This
                            sentiment, however, is strongly stimulated by Japanese media. On the
                            other side of the question, the Prime Minister is very much aware of the
                            hidden opinion in Japan that is opposed to moving too quickly.
                            Therefore, Japan may move towards diplomatic relations with the <gloss

                            Japan may have only improved indirect relations with Peking, somewhat
                            like those that the U.S. now has with China, leaving full diplomatic
                            relations for a later stage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                            experience with American public opinion that if you do not yield to this
                            kind of domestic opinion, you will be ahead in the long run.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked about the
                            current situation in Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that we are continuing our intensive
                            negotiations with Hanoi. It is too early yet to say what will come of
                            them. If Japan could desist from encouraging Hanoi, at least in the near
                            term, it would be helpful to the U.S. position. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked if Mr. <pb n="504"

                                >Kissinger</persName> saw any prospect of a settlement before
                            November. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said it
                            was impossible to say. If the U.S. sets a deadline, Hanoi will wait for
                            the deadline to see if they can extract another concession. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked about the Viet
                            Cong’s most recent public statement on the settlement. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that such Viet Cong
                            statements have in the past proved unhelpful, and added that the VC must
                            come through with something better than this in order to be acceptable
                            to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName> asked where the
                            military situation stood, noting recent Communist gains around Danang.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> acknowledged
                            recent Communist tactical gains, but said that this sort of military
                            gain is too costly to the other side. He added that the other side might
                            still attempt some drastic military initiatives next month. Basically,
                            however, from the military standpoint the North Vietnamese are in bad
                            shape. They have now lost something like 600 out of the 700 tanks they
                            possessed at the outset of the spring offensive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Policy Toward the Korean Principle</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN_1">Ushiba</persName>, noting his
                            government’s satisfaction with the outcome of the Korean question in the
                            General Assembly, asked if the Soviet Union had evidenced any concern
                            over Korea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said
                            that the Soviets of course want to avoid any evidence of <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> influence on the Peninsula. But at the
                            same time they are in a dilemma as to whether increased <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> influence would be preferable to that
                            of the United States and Japan.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that in Moscow
                            he had mentioned Japan’s concern about the northern islands. In
                            principle the Soviet Union does want better relations with Japan. The
                            question, however, is whether they want them sufficiently at this point
                            to make the concessions Japan is insisting on vis-à-vis the northern
                            territories.</p>

                        <p>The Japan-<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> joint communiqué issued in
                            Peking on September 29 at the conclusion of Japanese Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s discussions with
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> leaders closely follows a

                            newspaper and contains no real surprises. The communiqué agrees to the
                            ending of the abnormal situation existing between the two countries
                            since the conclusion of World War II, calls for the establishment of
                            diplomatic relations effective September 29 with the exchange of
                            ambassadors at the earliest possible moment, waives Chinese war
                            reparations claims, mutually disclaims hegemonistic aims, and promises
                            efforts to work out specific agreements on trade, aviation, transport,
                            and fisheries matters. The two countries also agreed to begin
                            negotiations to include a treaty of peace and friendship.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">No Chinese Surprises.</hi> The Chinese dealt easily
                            with <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> in the communiqué, as
                            they gave every intention of doing, and two of China’s so-called “three
                            principles” were, as expected, fudged. In the communiqué Japan expresses
                            clear agreement with the first principle (the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> is the sole legitimate government of China). With
                            regard to the second (Taiwan is a part of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>), Japan “understands and respects” the Chinese position
                            and “maintains the position based upon Article 8” of the Potsdam
                            Declaration. The latter reference, which had not been foreseen in
                            pre-trip speculation and hence may reflect a concession made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName> during the week’s
                            bargaining, amounts to an indirect Japanese renunciation of any residual
                            claim to Taiwan. Article 8 cites the Allied position that Japan’s
                            sovereignty after the surrender will be limited to the four main
                            Japanese islands and such minor islands as the Allies determine, and
                            also affirms the validity of the Cairo Declaration, which provided for
                            the return of Taiwan to the “Republic of China.”</p>
                        <p>As for the third <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> “principle”
                            (abrogation of the 1952 Japan/<gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> peace
                            treaty), the statement makes no commentary beyond an observation that
                            Japan “fully understands the three principles.” However, in presumed
                            compensation for this calculated vagueness, Foreign <pb n="506"

                            took pains to point out that Japan considers that the peace treaty with
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> has “lost the significance of

                            normalization had been that the 1952 treaty “should be abrogated” and
                            that the Tanaka cabinet had taken “many concrete steps” to improve
                            relations.</p>

                        <p>The President thanked him for the full briefing we had received, and
                            expressed the hope that this kind of consultation would continue to take
                            place whenever either of our two Governments planned to announce
                            important decisions.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> said that Japan’s
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> in Peking
                            were concluded successfully because of the understanding expressed by
                            the United States and because the President himself had already broken
                            the trail with his discussions in Peking earlier this year. Moreover, he
                            explained, the President’s visit had worked effectively to shape
                            domestic public opinion in Japan to make possible Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s decision. He
                            expressed full agreement with the statement attributed to Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Marshall Green</persName>, that
                            the reconciliation between Japan and China took place, not in spite of
                            the Japan-US Mutual Security Treaty, but because of it.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            leaders gave the Japanese any difficulties on the Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> replied “not at
                            all.”</p>
                        <p>The President characterized this as a significant shift in attitude. He
                            recalled that he talked to the Chinese leaders in categorical terms on
                            this point, stating that the Security Treaty serves the interests of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> as well as the United States in
                            maintaining peace in the Pacific. He noted rhetorically that the Chinese
                            had not asked Japan to abrogate the Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> observed that the
                            Chinese indicated the Security Treaty is a matter between Japan and the
                            United States, and that they understood that Japan feels that it needs
                            the Security Treaty. While the Chinese feel some anxiety about the
                            Security Treaty, he said, they did not wish to discuss it during Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>’s visit to Peking
                            because it is a bilateral matter between Japan and the United States. He
                            added that the realistic understanding shown by the Chinese had been a
                            great help to the Japanese side.</p>
                        <p>However, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> continued,
                            the success of the Japan-China negotiations in resolving the
                            long-pending issue between them only established diplomatic relations,
                            with the big problems still to come. As for Japan, he said, it would
                            take up the various problems between <pb n="509" facs="0540"
                                xml:id="pg_509"/>itself and China in an attitude of sincerity, after
                            having decided for itself what it should do, and what it should not do
                            to maintain peace in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> then noted that he
                            had already visited Australia and New Zealand and planned to visit
                            Moscow after leaving Washington, to explain the conciliation between
                            Japan and China. Three other special envoys had been sent to Korea and
                            Southeast Asia to make similar explanations. Up to now, he noted, these
                            various nations have indicated a general understanding, but some, he
                            admitted, feel a certain anxiety. His own duty, he believed, is to
                            endeavor to remove this sense of anxiety.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Taiwan, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Ohira</persName> was pleased to note that the situation in Taiwan,
                            following Japan’s reconciliation with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>, has remained peaceful, and no unfortunate situation
                            has arisen. Japan is prepared to create the non-governmental “contact
                            point” that it should to maintain non-governmental relations with
                            Taiwan, he said, and noted that civil aircraft and merchant shipping
                            have continued to operate as scheduled. He also noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> has taken steps to continue to provide
                            Taiwan preferential tariff treatment, even though diplomatic relations
                            have ended. Finally, he explained that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> was informed in advance that Japan planned to establish
                            a “contact point” in Taiwan, and that its Embassy and Consulate there
                            would be closed when the “contact point” is ready to function, to which
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> showed its understanding by not
                            saying “no.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Korea</p>
                        <p>The President asked how the Foreign Minister evaluated the current
                            developments in Korea.<note n="5" xml:id="d137fn5">On October 17, South

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> replied that he was
                            surprised by the big news he heard on landing in Los Angeles, that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Park</persName> had declared
                            martial law in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>. Shortly after
                            the Hawaii Summit talks at Kuilima, he said, he attended the
                                Japan-<gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> Ministerial Conference in
                            Seoul but saw no indications whatsoever of a trend toward martial law.
                            Therefore, he did not feel qualified to make an accurate response since
                            he lacked adequate information.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he had observed one reason cited by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Park</persName> for imposing martial
                            law was the uncertainty about international diplomatic moves, and
                            assumed that by this he meant the United States meeting with Peking, and
                            Japan’s meeting with <pb n="510" facs="0541" xml:id="pg_510"/>Peking. He
                            found it difficult, however, to concede that these meetings would affect
                            Korea in any detrimental manner.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> agreed with him.
                            When Special Envoy Toshio Kimura visited the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> just recently to explain the Japan-China
                            reconciliation, <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> officials indicated
                            an understanding but had indicated concern about any possible sudden
                            expansion of Japan’s interchanges with North Korea. Japan, however,
                            responded that it had no plans to do so. Accordingly, he found it
                            difficult to believe that Japan’s reconciliation with China had
                            triggered events in the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the importance of keeping the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> in as stable a condition as possible.
                            While we welcome contacts between the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> and North Korea, he cautioned that we did not wish to
                            give the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> any reason to feel that it
                            has been deserted. If Korea should blow up, he warned, the interests of
                            Japan and the United States would be seriously affected. He knew that
                            the Foreign Minister would agree, on the basis of his long experience in
                            international affairs, that we tend sometimes to keep our eyes only on
                            the big game, such as Japan’s new relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, the United States new relations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, Japan’s relations with the
                            Soviet Union, or new developments among the European nations. He
                            cautioned, however, that wars often come about when we fail to handle
                            small problems, such as Vietnam and Korea, which could have an extremely
                            adverse effect on our interests. He hoped, therefore, to keep in closest
                            touch with Japan in the interest of cooling down the situation and
                            reassuring the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> that it is not being
                            abandoned. We do not want, he declared firmly to have Korea explode
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> seems to be making steady
                            progress on its third 5-year Plan, begun this year, which stresses
                            energy and rural development. When it ends, the <gloss target="#t_ROK_1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Government and people both hope that their nation will

                            martial law might be a positive step to firm up the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK_1">ROK</gloss> financial and economic foundations. He
                            understood the President’s statement about the need to keep an eye on
                            the “small game” as well as the “big game;” the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> also understands this need and would, he said, make an

                            programs to reduce trade barriers. He recalled saying in Hawaii that we
                            consider it most important that Japan and the United States not be cut
                            out of the great developments in Europe, and that it would be
                            detrimental to increased trade and better relations if the <gloss

                            take steps to avoid that, through frank discussions among the United
                            States, Japan and the European nations, as equals.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> said that he shared
                            this view, and explained that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK_1"

                            the latter’s visit to Tokyo in mid-September. He did not foresee any
                            change in Japan’s confidence that it would proceed in this
                            direction.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>, changing the
                            subject, noted the recent flurry of activity related to Vietnam and
                            asked whether the President could tell him about the present situation
                            and the prospects for peace there.</p>
                        <p>The President obliged, stating that recently for the first time the North
                            Vietnamese have begun to negotiate seriously. In Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s twenty secret meetings in
                            Paris all the North Vietnamese did was talk, but they did not negotiate
                            seriously until the most recent meeting in which General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also participated. He cautioned
                            that there are major differences between us, and pointed out that these
                            negotiations involve not two parties (the United States and North
                            Vietnam) but three (including the South Vietnamese), for which reason
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, General Abrahms
                            and Ambassador Bunker were today talking to President Thieu in Saigon,
                            to make certain that he is fully aware of developments and to give him
                            the opportunity to participate.</p>
                        <p>The President called attention to one point of great interest, which he
                            asked the Minister to convey to Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tanaka</persName>; he noted the broad speculation
                            that with the elections only three weeks off the United States wishes to
                            bring these negotiations to an early conclusion, but denied emphatically
                            that this has any basis. The situation this year is totally different
                            from 1968, he explained, when the announcement of the bombing halt had a
                            positive effect in building up the candidacy of Hubert Humphrey, and
                            this year Vietnam is not a negative issue. Therefore, he said, he had
                            directed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> in all
                            negotiations not to think about the election, but to do what is right.
                            If the right kind of agreement can be reached now we will reach it, but
                            if it can not be reached now he said that we will wait until after the
                            elections. This, <pb n="512" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_512"/>he emphasized,
                            is sound policy. In that connection, he added, there will be no bombing
                            halt before the election without a settlement. Thus, he said, there is
                            no pressure on our negotiators to reach even a bad settlement now
                            because of the election.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wanted the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister to
                            know also that the speculation we would agree to impose a coalition
                            government on South Vietnam is totally false. We do want peace, he said,
                            but peace with honor, and would not impose a settlement on the people of
                            South Vietnam against their wishes.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the President explained, without making a prediction, there
                            comes a time when war should end. The ideal course was not to start a
                            war in the first place, he commented, but we feel that this is the time
                            for the war to end, on an honorable basis for both sides. He observed
                            that we have some reason to believe the other side also shares this
                            view. While we are still far apart in some critical areas, an
                            extraordinary effort is being made to negotiate seriously. He hoped that
                            the war would come to an end, and if the other side continued to
                            negotiate seriously he felt that there is a “chance,” not a “certainty,”
                            that it would end within a reasonable period of time. However, he
                            cautioned, the American elections would not be the primary factor.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> in
                            preparation for his own visit to Moscow noted the recent development of
                            broad areas of agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union,
                            including progress toward negotiating a trade agreement, and asked
                            whether the President could advise him with respect to the development
                            of US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that our relations with the Soviet Union are positive,
                            in trade, arms control and other areas. While there are some differences
                            between both countries, positive discussions are taking place. He felt
                            that there was no need to advise an experienced diplomat like Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName>, but simply wished to
                            observe that in working out the new relations between the United States
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, as well as the United
                            States and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, we did not rely on
                            sentimentality or emotions, but consulted our own interests, which the
                            Communist leaders understand and respect. In Moscow, he believed the
                            Minister would find that the Soviet leaders would show respect for Japan
                            and its great people as a great economic power. Japan, he said, is in a
                            good bargaining position, not a weak one, just as the Soviets are in a
                            good bargaining position.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President hoped that the Soviet leaders would be as
                            fair in their discussions of the Northern Territories with Japan as the
                            United States was about Okinawa. However, he added, he doubted they
                            would be.</p>
